The study aimed to determine the effects of health education on the achievements of diabetic patients regarding control and improvement of their health status; at Diabetic Health Centers in Khartoum State, Sudan; 2007-2010.

Before and after comparison was done. Data was processed using SPSS and pair t-test was used to determine the effect of health education. P-value equal or less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Test for before and after comparison was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05) for diabetic patients. They gained more knowledge after the implementation of the program; particularly in the areas of the nature and signs and symptoms of the disease, signs and symptoms of hypo & hyperglycemia, causes and warning signs of foot problems, foot care, and importance of exercises.Health education of diabetic patients is crucial for control of diabetes. Capacity building of diabetic health centers, strengthening diabetic patients association, and more research to study the effect of health education on diabetic patients were needed.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576384","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.702688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.605198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.567681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.323049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.312234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Sudan","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.183177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Podiatry","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podiatry"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Khartoum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Community health center","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_center"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Capacity building","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_building"}]}
