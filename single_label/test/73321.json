{"id":73321,"title":"Shoulder function following reconstruction with the supraclavicular artery island flap.","abstract":"The supraclavicular artery island flap (SCAIF) is a pedicled fasciocutaneous flap used for head and neck reconstruction. In recent years, its use has significantly increased as a result of several advantageous characteristics, including pliability, an excellent color and texture match, ability to reconstruct a variety of skin and aerodigestive tract defects, and short harvest times. Clinical experience suggests that donor site complications are relatively infrequent and typically self-limiting, and there have been no documented cases of prolonged or permanent shoulder dysfunction. However, formal studies have not been performed to assess this outcome. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of SCAIF flap harvest on postoperative shoulder strength and flexibility.Prospective cohort pilot study.Data was gathered prospectively during routine follow-up and surveillance. The Penn Shoulder Score and Constant Shoulder Scale were used to measure subjective and objective outcomes. Physical therapists performed testing for strength and flexibility.Ten patients were evaluated from January to July, 2013. Subjective self-reporting of shoulder function and satisfaction was good to excellent in most patients. The majority of patients demonstrated limitations in range of motion for one or more shoulder movements. Muscle strength was preserved postoperatively.Harvest of the SCAIF appears to have limited postoperative morbidity. Postoperative shoulder strength and function appears to be very good; however, some limitation of range of motion was observed.4","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24913956","annotations":[{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Physical
