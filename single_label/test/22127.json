{"id":22127,"title":"Orbital cellulitis and intraconal abscess formation after strabismus surgery in an adult patient.","abstract":"We report a 60-year-old woman who presented with orbital cellulitis, restricted ocular motility, proptosis, and visual acuity of counting fingers in her left eye 3 days after strabismus surgery. Although she initially responded well to antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy, visual acuity in the left eye again decreased on postoperative day 5. Radiographic imaging revealed an intraconal orbital abscess, and she underwent left lateral orbitotomy with abscess drainage, with continued antibiotics and a tapering dose of steroids. To our knowledge, this is the first case of orbital cellulitis and intraconal abscess after strabismus surgery in an adult.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568992","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.902106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.892817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Eye surgery","weight":0.881858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_surgery"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.749063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.730934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.675683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.613936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.580452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.240731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.181659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Orbital cellulitis","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_cellulitis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Orbital (band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_(band)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Strabismus surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus_surgery"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
