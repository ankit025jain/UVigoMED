{"id":78215,"title":"[The expression of tumor related macrophages and matrix solution element in laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissue and the relationship with tumor microvascular density].","abstract":"To study the expression of CD68 antibody marked tumor associated macrophage TAMs and matrix solution element MMP-7 in laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissue and the relationship with clinicopathological parameters, so that to explore the relationship between the expression of the two molecular markers and laryngeal cancer tissue microvascular density (MVD).Immunohistochemical method was employed to detect the expression of CD68 and MMP-7 in 65 cases (laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissue in 45 cases; peritumoral nontumor tissue in 20 cases) and CD 34 antibody marked MVD expression.CD68 positive rate in squamous carcinoma tissue (82.2%, 37/45) is obviously higher than that in the peritumoral tissue (15%, 3/20) (P < 0.05), and MMP-7 positive rate in squamous carcinoma tissue is significantly different from that in peritumoral tissue (71.1%; 25%) (P < 0.05). The expression rate of CD34-MVD in laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissue( 26.52 +/- 6.36 )is higher than that in peritumoral tissue (12.23 +/- 4.01) (P < 0.05). In lymph node metastasis group, the positive expression rates of CD68 and MMP-7 are higher than those in the group without lymph node metastasis. MMP-7 showed no correlation with cancer stage, and CD68 was related with cancer stage; CD68, MMP-7 and CD34- MVD have positive correlation.The high level of expression of TAMs and MMP-7 in laryngeal cancer tissue and the positive correlation with MVD illustrate that both of the markers play important roles in promoting laryngeal squamous carcinoma tissue metastasis and angiogenesis, which can be used as important markers to evaluate the invasion and metastasis of laryngeal cancer.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738320","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.838126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.801646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.686631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.597689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.547641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.536871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.326841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"CD68","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD68"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"}]}
