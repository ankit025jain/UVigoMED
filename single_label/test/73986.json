{"id":73986,"title":"Cadherin adhesion controlled by cortical actin dynamics.","abstract":"Cadherin-containing cell-cell junctions respond to intercellular tension by increasing their size, strength and complexity. The mechanical regulation of cadherin adhesions is now shown to involve myosin-dependent tension in the cortical actomyosin cytoskeleton. This reduces actin turnover to decrease the mobility of cadherin molecules and increase their concentration at junctions.
