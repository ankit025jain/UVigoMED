{"id":31841,"title":"The spectre of court-sanctioned sacrificial separation of teenage conjoined twins against their will.","abstract":"In a recent decision of the Indian Supreme Court, judges foreshadowed authorising separation of teenage conjoined twins where both would die if not separated but where the operation could save only one. The absence of medical information advising separation precluded such a decision in the case at hand. However, the case raises a number of difficult legal and ethical questions that judges would have to consider before authorising sacrificial separation of these or other non-infant conjoined twins.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087373","annotations":[{"name":"Supreme Court of India","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.612587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Supreme Court of the United States","weight":0.451803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.393104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Ghost","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost"},{"name":"Sacrifice","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice"},{"name":"Conjoined twins","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Save (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)"},{"name":"Foreshadowing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadowing"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Separation of powers","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"}]}
