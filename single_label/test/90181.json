{"id":90181,"title":"Vascularized nail transfer from non-replantable digit: a case report.","abstract":"We report the case of a traumatic amputation by circular saw of the ring and small fingers, associated with middle finger nail matrix loss and tendon, bone and joint exposure. The replantation was not attempted with patient's consent. Since the nail unit from the ring finger was intact, we decided to harvest the ring finger nail unit for major finger reconstruction. Although the principle of vascularized transfer from a severely damaged finger is widely recognized and the vascularized nail transfer from toe is a relatively common procedure, there is no description of a vascularized nail transfer from a non-replantable digit in the literature.
