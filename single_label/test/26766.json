{"id":26766,"title":"Outcomes and prosthesis choice for active aortic valve infective endocarditis: analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database.","abstract":"National prosthesis use in active aortic valve infective endocarditis (IE) is unreported. Prosthesis usage and outcomes in patients undergoing an aortic valve operation with active IE was evaluated.The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database was used to identify patients with active IE who underwent an aortic valve operation from January 1, 2005, to June 30, 2011. All patients with active IE were included. Demographics, procedures, outcomes, and trends were analyzed.Of 11,560 patients who were identified as having active IE, 8,421 (73%) had no prior operations (primary) and 3,139 (27%) had a history of any prior cardiac operation (reoperative). Operations for primary vs reoperative patients included isolated replacement in 88.5% vs 58.7% and root replacement in 7.2% vs 29.9%. Major morbidity was 60.8% vs 68%, and the unadjusted mortality rate was 9.8% vs 21.1%. Over time, for primary operations, biologic valve use increased (57% to 67%), and mechanical and homograft valve use decreased (30% to 24% and 9% to 6%; p < 0.001). For reoperations, biologic valve use increased (38% to 52%), and mechanical and homograft use decreased (20% to 17% and 38% to 28%; p < 0.001). Homografts were used more often in reoperations (32% vs 7%).Morbidity and mortality rates death are high for operations for active IE. Biologic valves were increasingly used vs mechanical and homograft valves. Homograft valves were used more often in reoperative patients after any prior cardiac operation. The mortality rate varied among prosthesis groups but may be related to the severity of infection and type of procedure performed.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25085561","annotations":[{"name":"Infective endocarditis","weight":0.892676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infective_endocarditis"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.814694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.747562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.652019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.398237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Indo-European languages","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"}]}
