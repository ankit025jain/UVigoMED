{"id":30264,"title":"Interrupting the social processes linked with initiation of injection drug use: results from a pilot study.","abstract":"Injection drug use is a skill learned in social settings. Change the Cycle (CTC), a peer-delivered, one-session intervention, is designed to reduce among people who inject drugs (PIDs) injection initiation-related behaviours (i.e., speaking positively about injecting to non-injectors, injecting in front of non-injectors, explaining or showing a non-injector how to inject) and initiation of non-injectors. We hypothesized that participation in CTC would lead to reductions in initiation-related behaviours six months later.Using respondent driven sampling (RDS), 98 PIDs were recruited in Toronto, Canada to participate in pilot testing of CTC. The baseline session consisted of a structured interview, the peer-delivered CTC intervention, instructions regarding RDS coupon distribution, and an invitation to return in six months for a follow-up interview. For the 84 PIDs completing the six-month interview, we compared initiation-related behaviours at baseline with six-month follow-up.The proportion of PIDs offering to initiate a non-injector was reduced from 8.4% (95% CI: 2.5, 15.9) at baseline to 1.59% (95% CI: 0.4, 3.7) at 6-month follow-up. The prevalence of speaking positively about injection to non-injectors also decreased significantly. The proportion of PIDs who helped a non-injector with a first injection at baseline was 6.2% (95% CI: 2.1, 11.3) and at follow-up was 3.5% (95% CI: 0.8, 7.1). Paired analyses of initiator baseline versus follow-up data showed a 72.7% reduction in initiation (95%CI: 47.7, 83.1).While further refinements remain to be tested, pilot study results suggest that CTC holds promise as a prevention intervention.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529687","annotations":[{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.706451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.468172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.455173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Toronto","weight":0.391192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto"},{"name":"Sociology","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.313385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.217447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Social environment","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0293966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Defendant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant"},{"name":"Principal ideal domain","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal_domain"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Coupon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon"},{"name":"Structured interview","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_interview"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"}]}
