{"id":28500,"title":"[Cognitive impairment of alcohol-dependent subjects].","abstract":"Chronic excessive alcohol consumption induces multiple brain damages. Secondary cognitive disorders include executive functions, episodic memory and visuospatial capacities. The severity of these alcohol induced disorders may vary between sub-clinical manifestations (that may, nevertheless, interfere with medical management) and more important ones like Korsakoff syndrome or dementia. The latter are usually irreversible but many of these manifestations are potentially reversible with persistent abstinence. It therefore appears of particular importance to clearly define neuropsychological management in order to identify and evaluate the type and severity of alcohol-related cognitive disorders. The patients may then be offered rehabilitation for these cognitive impairments. This is the first step of a complete addiction program based especially on cognitive behavioral therapies.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24855773","annotations":[{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Episodic memory","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory"},{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Executive functions","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.745082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Behaviour therapy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.58252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Korsakoff's syndrome","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korsakoff's_syndrome"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.474442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Long-term effects of alcohol","weight":0.420224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_effects_of_alcohol"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.330978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.244756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Spatial-temporal reasoning","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial-temporal_reasoning"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Executive (government)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Sergei Korsakoff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Korsakoff"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"}]}
