{"id":31508,"title":"Dysplasia of the contralateral hip in patients with unilateral late-detected congenital dislocation of the hip: 50 years' follow-up of 48 patients.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of dysplasia in the 'normal' contralateral hip in patients with unilateral developmental dislocation of the hip (DDH) and to evaluate the long-term prognosis of such hips. A total of 48 patients (40 girls and eight boys) were treated for late-detected unilateral DDH between 1958 and 1962. After preliminary skin traction, closed reduction was achieved at a mean age of 17.8 months (4 to 65) in all except one patient who needed open reduction. In 25 patients early derotation femoral osteotomy of the contralateral hip had been undertaken within three years of reduction, and later surgery in ten patients. Radiographs taken during childhood and adulthood were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 50.9 years (43 to 55) at the time of the latest radiological review. In all, eight patients (17%) developed dysplasia of the contralateral hip, defined as a centre-edge (CE) angle < 20° during childhood or at skeletal maturity. Six of these patients underwent surgery to improve cover of the femoral head; the dysplasia improved in two after varus femoral osteotomy and in two after an acetabular shelf operation. During long-term follow-up the dysplasia deteriorated to subluxation in two patients (CE angles 4° and 5°, respectively) who both developed osteoarthritis (OA), and one of these underwent total hip replacement at the age of 49 years. In conclusion, the long-term prognosis for the contralateral hip was relatively good, as OA occurred in only two hips (4%) at a mean follow-up of 50 years. Regular review of the 'normal' side is indicated, and corrective surgery should be undertaken in those who develop subluxation.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25183584","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.747832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.706773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.690594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.546841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.476651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.383287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.335411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Subluxation","weight":0.269585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.242061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.222677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.170117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Varus deformity","weight":0.11274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varus_deformity"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Continental shelf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_shelf"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Bone age","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_age"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"}]}
