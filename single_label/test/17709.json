{"id":17709,"title":"Proteome profile of a pandemic Vibrio parahaemolyticus SC192 strain in the planktonic and biofilm condition.","abstract":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the leading causative agents of foodborne diseases in humans. In this study, the proteome profiles of the pandemic strain V. parahaemolyticus SC192 belonging to the O3:K6 serovar during the planktonic and biofilm stages were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This non-gel-based multidimensional protein identification technology approach identified 45.5% of the proteome in the reference genome V. parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210633. This is the largest proteome coverage obtained so far in V. parahaemolyticus and provides evidence for expression of 27% of the hypothetical proteins. Comparison of the planktonic and biofilm proteomes based on their cluster of orthologous groups, gene ontologies and KEGG pathways provides basic information on biofilm specific functions and pathways. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to generate a global proteome profile of the pandemic strain of V. parahaemolyticus and the method reported here could be used to rapidly obtain a snapshot of the proteome of any microorganism at a given condition.
