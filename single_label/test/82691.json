{"id":82691,"title":"Management for premalignant lesions of the oral cavity.","abstract":"Premalignant lesions of the oral cavity present as visibly abnormal areas of mucosa and may be a source of significant anxiety for the patient and the clinician. Suspicious lesions should be biopsied to evaluate for dysplasia. The risk of malignant transformation may relate to patient characteristics, environmental risk factors and genetic alterations. Management of such lesions hinges on risk modification, surveillance, symptom management and directed biopsies. Excision or ablation of dysplastic lesions is indicated. We review the current evidence relating to management of premalignant lesions of the oral mucosa and make recommendations for practice patterns.
