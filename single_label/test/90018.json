{"id":90018,"title":"Effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on bone regeneration: biochemical and radiologic analyses.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound at 1.0 MHz on the healing process of fractures with bone loss in the rat fibula by alkaline phosphate level measurement and radiologic analyses.Thirty 70-day-old male Wistar rats underwent a bone resection of 2.5 to 3.0 mm between the proximal and middle third of the right fibular diaphysis. The animals were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups: reference (uninjured), control (injured only), and treated (injured and treated with 5 applications of ultrasound, interspersed by 2 days of rest, beginning 24 hours after the osteotomy). Euthanasia was performed at experimental periods of 7 and 14 days. The right hind limb was removed for radiologic analysis. The blood was collected via cardiac puncture to determine the serum alkaline phosphatase activity.The bone fractures had not been completely consolidated in the treated and control group when analysis of the bone took place. At day 7, the serum alkaline phosphatase activity was higher in the treated group (mean ± SD, 72.17 ± 7.02 U/L) compared to the control (65.26 ± 8.41 U/L) and reference (67.21 ± 7.86 U/L) groups. At day 14, higher alkaline phosphatase activity was seen in the control group (68.96 ± 8.12 U/L) compared to the treated (66.09 ± 8.46 U/L) and reference (67.14 ± 7.96 U/L) groups.The biochemical and radiologic results suggest that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound can be used as an auxiliary method to consolidate fractures and probably reduces the bone healing time, offering clinical benefits.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658953","annotations":[{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.686122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.67264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.398826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.34897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.305814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.296343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.232662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Euthanasia","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Hindlimb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindlimb"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"}]}
