{"id":28503,"title":"Alcohol use disorder, contexts of alcohol use, and the risk of HIV transmission among South African male patrons of shebeens.","abstract":"Shebeens in South Africa are settings in which alcohol use and sexual behavior often co-occur. The prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and the association between AUD, situations and settings, and sexual risk behavior, in shebeens remains unknown.Men (n=763; mean age=30; 98% Black African) were recruited from townships in Cape Town, South Africa and completed a self-administered survey that assessed alcohol use, sexual risk behaviors, and situations and settings of alcohol use. The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule DSV-IV Version (AUDADIS-IV) was used to identify the likelihood of AUD. Bivariate regression analyses assessed whether screening for AUD predicted sexual risk behaviors. Multivariate regression analyses examined whether AUD and/or situations/settings predicted risk behaviors.Nearly two-thirds of men (62%) endorsed sufficient criteria for AUD; 25%, 17%, and 20% were classified as having a mild, moderate, or severe AUD, respectively. AUD was associated with HIV risk such that men with AUD reported more unprotected sex than men without AUD. Analyses indicated that (a) individual (i.e., AUD) and (b) settings (i.e., frequency of having sex with a partner in a shebeen, tavern, or bottle store) interacted to predict unprotected sex.The prevalence of AUD among shebeen patrons was high and was associated with unprotected sex. Findings suggest the need to integrate both individual and situational/setting factors to prevent HIV among patrons of shebeens.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854966","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.730851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Safe sex","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_sex"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.588136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.567703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.558538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.518004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.498387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.490611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cape Town","weight":0.432155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.330652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patronage","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Bottle","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle"},{"name":"Australian dollar","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar"},{"name":"Globalization","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"},{"name":"Recklessness (psychology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recklessness_(psychology)"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Cape of Good Hope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope"},{"name":"Domestic partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Tavern","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavern"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Civil disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liberalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
