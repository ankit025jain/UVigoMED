{"id":82838,"title":"The essential role of cone beam computed tomography to diagnose the localization of impacted maxillary canine and to detect the austerity of the adjacent root resorption in the Romanian population.","abstract":"The impaction phenomenon is a pathological condition which is defined as the lack of eruption of a permanent tooth in the oral cavity. After third molar, the first permanent tooth impacted in the alveolar bone is the permanent maxillary canine, with varies from 1% to 3%. The aim of this study was to use the most recently imaging technique--CBCT, to evaluate the position of the impacted maxillary canine and to determinate the severity of root resorption of the adjacent teeth.The all 230 patients of this study were referred to a CBCT scanning with Scanora machine and only the region of clinical interest was irradiated.The age of the subjects was distributed between the ages of 11 and 42 years. From a total of 364 impacted canine teeth, 92 were side impacted canines, 97 right impacted canines and 87 were left impacted canines.We report a lateral incisors root resorption present in 54.37% and 24.29% the resorption of central incisors.The use of CBCT in patients with impacted canines has potential diagnostic and may influence the planning of treatment. Also the CBCT can be a genuine method used to rectify, to diagnose and to make a suggestive treatment for the resorption of the root of incisors.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505917","annotations":[{"name":"Maxillary canine","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_canine"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Canine tooth","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"},{"name":"Wisdom tooth","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_tooth"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.728037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Maxillary lateral incisor","weight":0.667981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_lateral_incisor"},{"name":"Root resorption","weight":0.641229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_resorption"},{"name":"Maxillary central incisor","weight":0.64103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_central_incisor"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.616201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.609186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.534084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.419367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Cone cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Impaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaction"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"}]}
