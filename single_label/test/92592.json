{"id":92592,"title":"Drug induction in connective tissue diseases.","abstract":"Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are defined as a group of acquired disorders resulting from persistent immuno-mediated inflammation. Several classes of drugs seem to be capable of inducing or exacerbating CTDs. A drug-induced (DI) syndrome is defined as a condition temporally related to continuous drug exposure, which resolves upon drug discontinuation. Among CTDs, lupus erythematosus is the most widely known and investigated DI syndrome. However, in recent years, the association between the onset of other CTDs, such as dermatomyositis (DM) and morphea/systemic sclerosis (SSc) has increased in patients with preceding exposure to particular substances. Herein, we conducted a review of published case reports including DM and morphea/SSc, evaluating the real causality among drugs and these syndromes.
