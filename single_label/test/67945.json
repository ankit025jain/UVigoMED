{"id":67945,"title":"Outcome and cost analysis of induction immunosuppression with IL2Mab or ATG in DCD kidney transplants.","abstract":"Kidney transplantation from DCD now represents a significant part of the overall transplant activity in the UK. Outcome of different induction immunosuppression regimes and related cost benefit analysis has been reported by very few studies.This is a single centre study on frequency-matched patients who received a DCD kidney transplant between August 2007 and August 2009.Data on 45 patients divided in 2 groups were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. Group A (24 patients) received IL2Mab and Group B (21 patients) ATG as induction immunosuppression. Patient and graft survival were similar in both groups.In the ATG-induced group, there was a significant lower rate of DGF, BPAR, and infections requiring readmission.A cost analysis was performed including all immunosuppression-related costs, and it has shown remarkable savings in the ATG-induced group.Considering that the number of DCD kidney transplants is destined to rise in the UK, we believe that ATG is a valid option to continue optimizing outcomes of DCD kidney transplant. In our experience, ATG proved to be safe, effective, and contributed to significant cost savings.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573113","annotations":[{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.641586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.446029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.378737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.30477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.214447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Total cost of ownership","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership"},{"name":"Mab (moon)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mab_(moon)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 24","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_24"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
