{"id":65854,"title":"GALNT4 predicts clinical outcome in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"We investigated the clinical significance of GALNT4 expression in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.Enrolled in this study were 104 patients treated with curative nephrectomy at Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai during 2004. Of the cohort 23 patients died of disease, 33 experienced recurrence and 3 died of another cause. GALNT4 density was assessed by immunohistochemistry in patient specimens. Univariate and multivariate Cox models, and ROC analysis were used to analyze the impact of prognostic factors on overall and relapse-free survival. Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log rank test was done to compare clinical outcomes between subgroups.Intratumor GALNT4 expression was significantly lower than peritumor expression. Low GALNT4 expression was associated with poor overall and relapse-free survival (p = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). Intratumor GALNT4 expression, which negatively correlated with tumor size (p = 0.032), necrosis (p = 0.013) and TNM stage (p = 0.017), was an independent prognostic indicator for overall and relapse-free survival (HR 3.088, p = 0.020 and 2.173, p = 0.047, respectively). Extending the TNM staging system according to GALNT4 expression showed a better prognostic value for overall and relapse-free survival (AUC 0.786, p = 0.029 and 0.761, p = 0.040, respectively).Intratumor GALNT4 expression is a potential independent prognostic factor for overall and relapse-free survival in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Further external validation and functional analysis should be performed to assess its potential prognostic and therapeutic value in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769034","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.901907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.777776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.732206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.521449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.449517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.422191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.187187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.137565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.108815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Functional analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"Zhongshan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Self-Defense_Forces_of_Colombia"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"761","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/761"},{"name":"786","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/786"},{"name":"Lumber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Uncial 047","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_047"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Laboratory specimen","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_specimen"}]}
