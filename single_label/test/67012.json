{"id":67012,"title":"Incidence of hypercoagulable events after image-guided percutaneous cryoablation of renal tumors: a single-center experience.","abstract":"To identify retrospectively hypercoagulable events that occurred over time in patients who underwent image-guided percutaneous renal cryoablation and compare the incidence with a cohort of patients who underwent surgical partial nephrectomy (PN) during the same time period.An electronic medical record database was queried for patients who underwent percutaneous image-guided renal mass cryoablation or PN between September 2006 and June 2012. Records were examined for thrombotic events during the year following the procedure in each group. Incidence rates, Kaplan-Meier estimates, and patient demographic variables were compared using the stratified log-rank test and t test for independent samples.The study comprised 114 cryoablation cases. The cumulative incidence of thrombotic events after 1 year was 4.39%. The incidence per 100 person-years was 4.84. There were 105 PN cases. The cumulative incidence of thrombotic events after 1 year was 1.0%. The incidence per 100 person-years was 1.14. The person-time incidence rate difference for these two groups did not reach statistical significance (P = .0894).The incidence of thrombotic events in patients who underwent percutaneous renal cryoablation in this study was not significantly different than a comparable cohort who underwent surgical PN during the same time period.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656177","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.702217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Electronic medical record","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_medical_record"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.350431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.350431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.210315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.17955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Cryoablation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryoablation"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"}]}
