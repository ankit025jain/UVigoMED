{"id":67307,"title":"Circulating Angiopoietin-2 levels predict mortality in kidney transplant recipients: a 4-year prospective case-cohort study.","abstract":"Angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2) impairs endothelial function by preventing angiopoietin 1 from binding to their common endothelial-specific receptor Tie2. Here, we examined whether circulating Angpt2 predicts outcome in kidney transplant recipients. For this case-cohort study, we selected 130 kidney transplant recipients who had died or returned to dialysis within the first 2 years of follow-up of our cohort study, as well as 130 age- and gender-matched kidney transplant recipients without an event (controls) from a total of 993 kidney transplant recipients. The total of 260 selected patients were followed in median 4 years. Serum Angpt2 at baseline was measured using an in-house immunoluminometric assay. Median Angpt2 concentrations were significantly higher in patients who died [median (interquartile range--IQR) 3.6 (2.8-5.9) ng/ml] as compared to patients who did not die during the study period [2.8 (2.1-4.1) ng/ml; P < 0.001]. Ln (natural log) Angpt2 levels correlated positively with C-reactive protein levels (r = 0.315, P < 0.001) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (r = 0.188, P = 0.002) and were inversely associated with eGFR (r = -0.301, P < 0.001) hemoglobin (r = -0.269, P < 0.001), and serum albumin concentrations (r = -0.382, P < 0.001). On multivariate analyses, baseline Angpt2 levels independently predicted all-cause mortality (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio associated with one natural log unit higher Angpt2 level: 1.70 (95% confidence interval: 1.10-2.61)). In our analysis, circulating Angpt2 was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in stable, prevalent kidney transplant recipients.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628855","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.843988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Serum albumin","weight":0.643122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albumin"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.588142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.564681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.342518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.318158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.271872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.259241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Natural logarithm","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0312312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Angiopoietin","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiopoietin"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/993"},{"name":"260","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/260"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"}]}
