{"id":44961,"title":"Hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy for colovesical fistula associated with diverticular disease.","abstract":"To evaluate the feasibility and short-term outcome of hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy (HALC) for the treatment of colovesical fistula complicating diverticulitis, we reviewed the files of all 34 patients who underwent surgery for diverticular colovesical fistula in 1999 to 2010 at a major tertiary medical center. Twenty-one were treated with HALC and 13 with open colectomy. There were no differences in demographic parameters among the groups. HALC and open colectomy had similar operating time. HALC was associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay compared with open colectomy (5 vs. 8 d, P=0.001). HALC proved to be technically feasible and safe in this setting. It provided benefits of tactile feedback and manual manipulation as in open colectomy while maintaining the advantages of a minimal invasive approach.
