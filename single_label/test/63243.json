{"id":63243,"title":"Flow cytometric differentiation of abnormal and normal plasma cells in the bone marrow in patients with multiple myeloma and its precursor diseases.","abstract":"Flow cytometric (FC) enumeration of abnormal plasma cells (APCs) for diagnosis and prognostication of plasma cell dyscrasias (PCD) is challenging. We studied antigen expression in normal plasma cells (NPC) (N = 34) and APC in a series of unselected PCD (N = 59). NPC subpopulations often demonstrated CD19(-), CD20(+), CD45(-) or dim and CD56(+), an immunophenotype observed in PCD. However abnormal CD81 was only observed in APCs (APC detection sensitivity 95%; specificity 100%). We evaluated differences in antigen expression patterns among MGUS (N = 14), SMM (N = 35) and MM (N = 10), finding the combination of CD45 and CD56 helpful in differentiating MGUS from SMM and MM (p = 0.0002).","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462038","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.878028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"PTPRC","weight":0.822731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.771879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunophenotyping","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunophenotyping"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Antigen-presenting cell","weight":0.658027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance","weight":0.452663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy_of_undetermined_significance"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"CD81","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD81"},{"name":"Non-player character","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Enumeration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Adenomatous polyposis coli","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenomatous_polyposis_coli"},{"name":"PCD (album)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCD_(album)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"}]}
