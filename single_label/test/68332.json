{"id":68332,"title":"Chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis is associated with decreased serum PCSK9 levels.","abstract":"Serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) correlates positively with serum PCSK9 in the general population, consistent with PCSK9 being a determinant of LDL-C levels. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) have lower total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C compared to the general population. Serum PCSK9 and its relationship with serum lipids have not been reported in CKD patients on HD (CKD-HD).We measured serum PCSK9 by ELISA and lipid levels in 66 CKD-HD patients and compared them to 178 non-CKD subjects. Since statins increase serum PCSK9 levels, CKD-HD patients were separated into those not on statin therapy (HD-NS, n = 32) and those taking statins (HD-S, n = 34). No control subjects were on statin therapy.Serum PCSK9, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C levels were significantly lower in the CKD-HD group (n = 66) compared to the control group. HD-NS patients showed lower PCSK9, TC and LDL-C levels than control subjects and PCSK9 levels correlated with TC and LDL-C levels (r = 0.35, p = 0.050; r = 0.423, p = 0.0158 respectively) as well as TG levels (r = 0.413, p = 0.0188). In HD-S patients, PCSK9 levels were not significantly different from the non-CKD group. There was no correlation between PCSK9 levels and TC and LDL-C levels in the HD-S group.Our data are the first quantitative analysis of serum PCSK9 levels in CKD-HD patients. We show that serum PCSK9 in HD-NS patients is decreased and it retains a positive correlation with LDL-C, suggesting that PCSK9 may remain a significant determinant of LDL-C in CKD-HD subjects. We also show that statin therapy disrupts the correlation between LDL-C and PCSK9 in CKD-HD patients. These data suggest that the regulation of LDL-C by PCSK9 remains intact in CKD-HD patients. PCSK9 may also play a role in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in CKD-HD patients.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529132","annotations":[{"name":"Statin","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.69715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.617121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.610321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.511934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.375161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.295179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.210101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.199057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
