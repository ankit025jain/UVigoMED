{"id":66950,"title":"The challenges in assessing contrast-induced nephropathy: where are we now?","abstract":"The objective of our study was to exposit the shifting perspectives on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) for IV low-osmolar iodinated contrast media.The historically inflated risk of CIN reflects logistic and intellectual pitfalls that continue to confound the study of this disease. Recent advances have clarified that the incidence of CIN is much lower than previously thought, but there are lingering questions. We suggest that CIN is likely real but is rare and offer directions for future study.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660707","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.351051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.116054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Intellectual","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Cincinnati Reds","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Iodinated contrast","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodinated_contrast"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"}]}
