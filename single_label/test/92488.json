{"id":92488,"title":"The dorsal pedis artery as a new distal landmark for extramedullary tibial alignment in total knee arthroplasty.","abstract":"It is better to use multiple anatomical landmarks to reduce errors in component alignment in total knee arthroplasty. Therefore, it is worthwhile to find a new landmark that can be used as an addition to conventional ones. Herein, we assessed the dorsal pedis artery as a new distal landmark for extramedullary tibial alignment.Fifty-two ankles in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty and 10 ankles in normal controls were included. Color Doppler ultrasonography was used to locate the dorsal pedis artery at the level of the ankle joint. Conventional landmarks, including the tibialis anterior tendon, the extensor hallucis longus tendon, the extensor digitorum longus tendon, and the malleolar centre, were also located on ultrasound images. The distances between the ankle centre and each landmark were measured and compared.The dorsal pedis artery was absent in 2 patients and impalpable but visible with ultrasonography in other 2 patients. The dorsal pedis artery was located anatomically closest to the ankle centre in patients (0.4 Â± 3.4 mm lateral). Statistical analysis showed that the dorsal pedis artery, the extensor hallucis longus tendon, and the malleolar centre were located significantly closer to the ankle centre comparing with the extensor digitorum longus tendon and the tibialis anterior tendon in both patients and controls (p < 0.001).As long as the dorsal pedis artery exists, it can be used as an addition to the conventional landmarks in total knee arthroplasty. Using this new landmark will help reduce errors in coronal plane alignment of tibial component.II.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23455389","annotations":[{"name":"Tibialis anterior muscle","weight":0.875083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibialis_anterior_muscle"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Extensor hallucis longus muscle","weight":0.796676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_hallucis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Coronal plane","weight":0.713749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_plane"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.645229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.610022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Extensor digitorum longus muscle","weight":0.573255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_digitorum_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.430951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Extensor digitorum muscle","weight":0.428794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_digitorum_muscle"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.315609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.212892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Malleus","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensor_carpi_radialis_longus_muscle"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Closer (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"}]}
