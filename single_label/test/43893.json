{"id":43893,"title":"Locoregional therapies for metastatic colorectal carcinoma to the liver--an evidence-based review.","abstract":"The liver is the most common visceral site of colorectal cancer metastasis and recurrence. Given that only 25% of patients with colorectal liver metastases are amenable to curative surgical resection at initial diagnosis, locoregional intra-arterial therapies including hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, conventional transarterial chemoembolization, drug-eluting-bead transarterial chemoembolization, and radioembolization have increasingly developed as viable treatment options. The rationale, efficacy, safety, and toxicity of each of these therapies are reviewed and stratified based on current evidence.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760444","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.637187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.485295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.386854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.249922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"}]}
