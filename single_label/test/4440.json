{"id":4440,"title":"[Current treatments for clonorchiasis].","abstract":"The paper briefly reviews the current techniques for treatment for human clonorchiasis, which are both widely used in medical practice and developed at experimental research laboratories. It describes specific examples of chemotherapy, including combined therapy, clonorchiasis vaccines and drug resistance. Particular emphasis is placed on the prospects of use of minor interfering RNA as a source of new-generation diagnostic and remedial agents.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286552","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.784086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.769519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.316275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
