{"id":87785,"title":"[\"A shot at the father: a student's assault\". Sigmund Freud and the case of Ernst Haberl].","abstract":"In the fall of 1922, the Freud family was involved in a criminal case: The son of Mathilde Freud's nursing sister, Ernst Haberl, had shot at his father. With the help of August Aichhorn the Viennese Juvenile Court's social assistance department was engaged on behalf of the young man. Freud commissioned the lawyer Valentin Teirich to defend him in court. The Viennese dailies reported the deed and the trial extensively (Haberl was acquitted). That a comment published in the Neue Freie Presse was written by Freud himself, as Teirich believed, is, according to Anna Freud, highly improbable.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988808","annotations":[{"name":"Crime","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Vienna","weight":0.30069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna"},{"name":"Assault","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault"},{"name":"Criminal law","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law"},{"name":"Sigmund Freud","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Lawyer","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer"},{"name":"Welfare","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare"},{"name":"Acquittal","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Court","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court"},{"name":"Anna Freud","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Freud"},{"name":"Neue Freie Presse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Freie_Presse"},{"name":"Freud family","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freud_family"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"1922","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1922"},{"name":"Saint Anne","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Anne"},{"name":"Officer (armed forces)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)"},{"name":"Deed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed"},{"name":"Newspaper","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper"},{"name":"Nursing sister","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_sister"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
