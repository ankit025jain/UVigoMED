{"id":82181,"title":"Effect of resin composites with sodium trimetaphosphate with or without fluoride on hardness, ion release and enamel demineralization.","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of the addition of sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) with or without fluoride on enamel demineralization, and the hardness and release of fluoride and TMP of resin composites.Bovine enamel slabs (4 x 3 x 3 mm) were prepared and selected based on initial surface hardness (n = 96). Eight experimental resin composites were formulated, according to the combination of TMP and sodium fluoride (NaF): TMP/NaF-free (control), 1.6% sodium fluoride (NaF), and 1.5%, 14.1% and 36.8% TMP with and without 1.6% NaF. Resin composite specimens (n = 24) were attached to the enamel slabs with wax and the sets were subjected to pH cycling. Next, surface and cross-sectional hardness and fluoride content of enamel as well as fluoride and TMP release and hardness of the materials were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA (P < 0.05).The presence of fluoride in enamel was similar in fluoridated resin composites (P > 0.05), but higher than in the other materials (P < 0.05). The combination of 14.1% TMP and fluoride resulted in less demineralization, especially on lesion surface (P < 0.05). The presence of TMP increased fluoride release from the materials and reduced their hardness.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693630","annotations":[{"name":"Ion","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.494375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Dental composite","weight":0.478155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_composite"},{"name":"Water fluoridation","weight":0.362428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation"},{"name":"Wax","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax"},{"name":"Vitreous enamel","weight":0.351019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Sodium trimetaphosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_trimetaphosphate"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Pulp (paper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)"},{"name":"Vickers hardness test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_hardness_test"},{"name":"Cycling","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"}]}
