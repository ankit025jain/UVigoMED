{"id":56437,"title":"Next target of tranilast: inhibition of corneal neovascularization.","abstract":"Corneal neovascularization (CN) which is associated with angiogenesis and inflammation is seen in different pathological conditions. Among all these situations inflammation and angiogenesis factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalo proteinases (MMPs), tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) and other related factors are involved in CN regardless of the etiology. Thus inhibition of these agents that lead to suppression of angiogenesis and inflammation is one the most important strategies to treat CN. Tranilast (TR) is an anti-allergic medicine which has been used in Japan and South Korea in clinic. TR is able to inhibit VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9, TNF-? and some other angiogenic and inflammatory factors. According to the anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory activity of TR, we hypothesize on the probable efficacy of TR in treating CN. Also topical application of TR in human eye is reported to be safe, so it would be easier to have additional research on therapeutic potential of TR in clinic.
