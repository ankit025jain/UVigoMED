{"id":42784,"title":"Recent chemotherapy reduces the maximum-standardized uptake value of 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in colorectal cancer.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of recent chemotherapy on the patterns of the maximum-standardized uptake value (M-SUV) and sensitivity of (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) in colorectal cancer.We retrospectively analyzed the FDG-PET/CT of 509 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer. Subgroup analysis was performed according to chemotherapy status; 401 patients were not treated with chemotherapy and 108 patients were treated with chemotherapy within 6 months prior to surgery. Pathologic analysis of the surgical specimen was used as the gold standard.The M-SUV was significantly lower in patients treated with chemotherapy than in those not treated with chemotherapy in pathologically confirmed same stages of disease. The difference in the sensitivity of the M-SUV according to chemotherapy status was greatest using a cutoff M-SUV value of 6.4 (p<0.001). The longest diameter of the primary tumor was the most important factor that correlated with M-SUV of the primary tumor irrespective of the chemotherapy effect (p<0.001). The M-SUV of the primary tumor was not an independent predictor of lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer.The results indicate that the M-SUV of FDG-PET/CT should be interpreted in the context of concurrent chemotherapy.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827621","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.810093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.641958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.613652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.469076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.147269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.128571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 509","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_509"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
