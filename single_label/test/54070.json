{"id":54070,"title":"Posterior segment eye disease in sub-Saharan Africa: review of recent population-based studies.","abstract":"To assess the burden of posterior segment eye diseases (PSEDs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).We reviewed published population-based data from SSA and other relevant populations on the leading PSED, specifically glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, as causes of blindness and visual impairment in adults. Data were extracted from population-based studies conducted in SSA and elsewhere where relevant.PSEDs, when grouped or as individual diseases, are a major contributor to blindness and visual impairment in SSA. PSED, grouped together, was usually the second leading cause of blindness after cataract, ranging as a proportion of blindness from 13 to 37%.PSEDs are likely to grow in importance as causes of visual impairment and blindness in SSA in the coming years as populations grow, age and become more urban in lifestyle. African-based cohort studies are required to help estimate present and future needs and plan services to prevent avoidable blindness.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479434","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.892155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.887746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.729272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.687712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.540087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.504448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Posterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.049571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Social Security Administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Administration"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
