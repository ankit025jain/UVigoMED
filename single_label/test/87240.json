{"id":87240,"title":"[Tissue reactions to the use of implants manufactured from lactic acid polymers].","abstract":"Recent literature on the morphological results of the application of polymers produced from lactic acid (polylactides--PLA), contains a plethora of experimental and clinical data on the efficiency and safety of their use for the medico-biological purposes. However, the question on the actual rate of biological disintegration of PLA materials remains unanswered. There are conflicting views on the inflammatory reaction ranging from a complete negation of an inflammatory response to PLA implantation up to the reports describing the expressed aseptic inflammatory reactions caused by presence of this material in tissues. Some researchers report the total absence of the foreign-body reactions to this class of implants, while some others indicate the obligatory formation of the foreign-body giant cells. Further research is necessary to precisely predict degradation processes of and to detect all the potential risks associated with the use of PLA-based materials.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"test","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552093","annotations":[{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.798717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.605455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.393264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.322685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Negation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"People's Liberation Army","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army"},{"name":"Process (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"}]}
