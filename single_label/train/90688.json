{"id":90688,"title":"Hypertonic saline as a therapy for pediatric concussive pain: a randomized controlled trial of symptom treatment in the emergency department.","abstract":"Three-percent hypertonic saline (HTS) is a hyperosmotic therapy used in pediatric traumatic brain injury to treat increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema. It also promotes plasma volume expansion and cerebral perfusion pressure, immunomodulation, and anti-inflammatory response. We hypothesized that HTS will improve concussive symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury.The study was a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Children, 4 to 7 years of age with a Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 13, were enrolled from a pediatric emergency department following closed-head injury upon meeting Acute Concussion Evaluation criteria with head pain. Patients were randomized to receive 10 mL/kg of HTS or normal saline (NS) over 1 hour. Self-reported pain values were obtained using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale initially, immediately following fluids, and at 2 to 3 days of discharge. The primary outcome measure was change in self-reported pain following fluid administration. Secondary outcome measures were a change in pain and postconcussive symptoms within 2 to 3 days of fluid administration. We used an intention-to-treat analysis.Forty-four patients, ranging from 7 to 16 years of age with comparable characteristics, were enrolled in the study; 23 patients (52%) received HTS, and 21 (48%) received NS. There was a significant difference (P < 0.001) identified in the self-reported improvement of pain following fluid administration between the HTS group (mean improvement = 3.5) and the NS group (mean improvement = 1.1). There was a significant difference (P = 0.01) identified in the self-reported improvement of pain at 2 to 3 days after treatment between the HTS group (mean improvement = 4.6) and the NS group (mean improvement = 3.0). We were unable to determine a difference in other postconcussive symptoms following discharge.Three-percent HTS is more effective than NS in acutely reducing concussion pain in children.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583571","annotations":[{"name":"Glasgow Coma Scale","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cerebral edema","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.844019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Intracranial pressure","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_pressure"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.782034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.664119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.630714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.562611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.475217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Cerebral perfusion pressure","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_perfusion_pressure"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.380612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.258022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Cerebral circulation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_circulation"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.028099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
