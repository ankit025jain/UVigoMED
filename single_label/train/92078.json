{"id":92078,"title":"Monteggia lesion in an Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea).","abstract":"A 10-yr-old female Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea) presented with a history of right forelimb lameness. Antebrachial radiographs revealed a Monteggia lesion, classified by cranial radial head luxation and distal diaphyseal ulnar fracture. Open reduction with placement of an ulnar-radial positional screw was performed. The lateral collateral ligament was reconstructed using suture anchored by a condylar screw and bone tunnel in the radius. Reduction and proper implant placement was confirmed on postoperative radiographs. The ulnar-radial positional screw was removed 6 wk postoperatively to allow proper supination and pronation. Limb function was greatly improved at this time; however, a mild lameness was still observed. At 7 mo postoperatively, the otter was ambulating lameness-free. Radiographs documented proper joint reduction and stable condylar screw. At 32 mo postoperatively, the otter continued to exhibit normal ambulation.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450070","annotations":[{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.785244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Pronation","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronation"},{"name":"Supination","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supination"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.762925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Fibular collateral ligament","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibular_collateral_ligament"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Head of radius","weight":0.714931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_radius"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.703722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.680992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.6184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Suture (anatomy)","weight":0.346988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suture_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.273167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.25896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Monteggia fracture","weight":0.179793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteggia_fracture"},{"name":"Forelimb","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forelimb"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Otter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otter"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"Aonyx","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aonyx"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Reduction (orthopedic surgery)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(orthopedic_surgery)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Positional notation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation"},{"name":"Linguistic reconstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.0154237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"},{"name":"Lameness (equine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lameness_(equine)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Oriental Small-clawed Otter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Small-clawed_Otter"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 10","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_10"},{"name":"Condylar canal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condylar_canal"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
