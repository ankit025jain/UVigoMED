{"id":32826,"title":"Frontal cortex BOLD signal changes in premanifest Huntington disease: a possible fMRI biomarker.","abstract":"To identify a possible functional imaging biomarker sensitive to the earliest neural changes in premanifest Huntington disease (preHD), allowing early therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing or delaying clinical onset.Sixteen preHD and 18 healthy participants were submitted to anatomical acquisitions and functional MRI (fMRI) acquisitions during the execution of the exogenous covert orienting of attention task. Due to strong a priori hypothesis, all fMRI correlation analyses were restricted to the following: (1) the frontal oculomotor cortex identified by the means of a prosaccadic task, comprising frontal eye fields and supplementary frontal eye fields; and (2) the data collected during inhibition of return, a phenomenon occurring during the executed task. In preHD, multiple regression analysis was performed between fMRI data and the probability to develop the disease in the next 5 years (p5HD). Moreover, mean blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the frontal oculomotor cortex and striatal volumes were linearly correlated with p5HD.In preHD, multiple regression analysis showed that clusters of activity strongly correlated with p5HD in the right frontal oculomotor cortex. Importantly, mean BOLD signal changes of this region correlated with p5HD (r(2) = 0.52). Among the considered striatal volumes, a modest correlation (r(2) = 0.29) was observed in the right putamen and p5HD.fMRI activations in the right-frontal oculomotor cortex during inhibition of return can be considered a possible functional imaging biomarker in preHD.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24898924","annotations":[{"name":"Huntington's disease","weight":0.901493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington's_disease"},{"name":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.773806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Putamen","weight":0.747825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putamen"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.677915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.648285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.616328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.55454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.340323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"A priori and a posteriori","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori"},{"name":"Oculomotor nerve","weight":0.235355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculomotor_nerve"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Frontal eye fields","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_eye_fields"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Functional imaging","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_imaging"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Secrecy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secrecy"},{"name":"Arterial blood gas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_blood_gas"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"}]}
