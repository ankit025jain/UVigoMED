{"id":16876,"title":"Verrucous lepromatous leprosy: a rare form of presentation--report on two cases.","abstract":"Leprosy skin lesions are described as hypochromic or erythematous macules, pale erythematous or reddish-brown plaques, papules, nodules, and diffuse cutaneous infiltration, depending on the clinical form of the disease. They may be accompanied by hypo or anesthesia, alopecia, and hypo or anhidrosis. Verrucous lesions are now quite uncommon in leprosy. The literature is sparse, with only 25 reported cases of this association, especially in the lepromatous pole of the disease. This work is a report on two cases of lepromatous leprosy of long evolution, coursing with vegetant verrucous lesions.
