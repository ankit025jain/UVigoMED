{"id":4631,"title":"Associations between antioxidants and all-cause mortality among US adults with obstructive lung function.","abstract":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterised by oxidative stress, but little is known about the associations between antioxidant status and all-cause mortality in adults with this disease. The objective of the present study was to examine the prospective associations between concentrations of ?- and ?-carotene, ?-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, Se, vitamin C and ?-tocopherol and all-cause mortality among US adults with obstructive lung function. Data collected from 1492 adults aged 20-79 years with obstructive lung function in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988-94) were used. Through 2006, 629 deaths were identified during a median follow-up period of 14 years. After adjustment for demographic variables, the concentrations of the following antioxidants modelled as continuous variables were found to be inversely associated with all-cause mortality among adults with obstructive lung function: ?-carotene (P= 0·037); ?-carotene (P= 0·022); cryptoxanthin (P= 0·022); lutein/zeaxanthin (P= 0·004); total carotenoids (P= 0·001); vitamin C (P< 0·001). In maximally adjusted models, only the concentrations of lycopene (P= 0·013) and vitamin C (P= 0·046) were found to be significantly and inversely associated with all-cause mortality. No effect modification by sex was detected, but the association between lutein/zeaxanthin concentrations and all-cause mortality varied by smoking status (P interaction= 0·048). The concentrations of lycopene and vitamin C were inversely associated with all-cause mortality in this cohort of adults with obstructive lung function.","date":"2014-11-15","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25315508","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tocopherol","weight":0.782502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocopherol"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.693168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.655992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Carotenoid","weight":0.504453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotenoid"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.366768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.246385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Lycopene","weight":0.195556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopene"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Carotene","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotene"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0768603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Cryptoxanthin","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptoxanthin"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
