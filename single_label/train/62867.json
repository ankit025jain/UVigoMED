{"id":62867,"title":"Serum microRNA-21 as a potential biomarker for response to hypomethylating agents in myelodysplastic syndromes.","abstract":"Identification of biomarkers that predict responses to hypomethylating agents (HMAs) will allow optimal strategies for epigenetic therapy in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to be established. Serum miR-21 was quantitatively measured in 58 MDS patients treated with HMAs and 14 healthy controls. Serum miR-192 was an internal control, and diagnostic performance was evaluated according to receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). ROC analysis indicated that serum miR-21 levels differentiated responders from non-responders with an area under the curve of 0.648 (95% confidence, 0.49 to 0.72). The baseline level of serum miR-21 was significantly lower in the responder group than in the non-responder group (P = 0.041). The overall response rate (ORR) of the high miR-21 group was significantly lower than that of the low miR-21 group (41.2 vs. 73.2%, P = 0.021). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly inferior in the high group versus the low group (14.0 vs. 44.5 months, P = 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the initial serum miR-21 level (P = 0.001) and circulating blasts (P = 0.007) were prognostic factors for PFS. Serum miR-21 level was significantly associated with ORR and PFS in MDS patients treated with HMAs. Although validation with a large prospective study is required, serum miR-21 is a potential biomarker of epigenetic therapy in MDS patients.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503739","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.511326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.406403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.401208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.383887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.237681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.221241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Carbon group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"648","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/648"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Office of Rail Regulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Rail_Regulation"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Internal control","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_control"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
