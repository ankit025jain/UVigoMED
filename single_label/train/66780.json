{"id":66780,"title":"Dissolution therapy versus shock wave lithotripsy for radiolucent renal stones in children: a prospective study.","abstract":"We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of dissolution therapy and standard shock wave lithotripsy as a noninvasive modality for radiolucent renal stones in children.A total of 87 children with radiolucent renal calculi were included in study. Median age was 2.5 years (range 0.5 to 13). Computerized tomography was done to confirm a stone density of less than 500 HU. Median stone length was 12 mm (range 7 to 24). Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. The medical group of 48 patients received potassium sodium hydrogen citrate at a dose of 1 mEq/kg per day for 1 to 3 months. The shock wave lithotripsy group of 39 patients were treated with a Lithotripter S (Dornier Medtech, Kennesaw, Georgia) while under general anesthesia. Complications in each group were recorded. Patients were considered stone free when imaging within 3 months showed no evidence of stones.The stone-free rate was 72.9% for dissolution therapy vs 82.1% after a single session of shock wave lithotripsy (p = 0.314). One patient per group experienced a pyelonephritis episode during followup (p = 0.698). Three of the 13 patients in whom medical regimens failed were noncompliant and 5 ingested the medication sporadically.Medical dissolution therapy is a well tolerated, effective treatment for radiolucent renal stones in children. It eliminates the need for shock wave lithotripsy in up to 73% of cases.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Male Urogenital
