{"id":51066,"title":"Non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas: Benefit from early growth hormone substitution after surgery.","abstract":"Data suggests that substitution of GH in GH-deficient patients may improve quality-of-life and reduce insufficiency-associated-symptoms. Unlike in corticotroph, thyreotroph, or gonadotroph-insufficiency, GH-substitution is usually not started within the first 6-12months after surgery. We aimed to investigate the effect of early-GH-substitution on body-composition, metabolic and pituitary-laboratory-tests, and quality-of-life.Data was reviewed from 21 adult-patients who were diagnosed with insufficiency of GH-axis using insulin-hypoglycemia-test. We retrospectively assessed body-composition, metabolic and pituitary-laboratory-tests and quality-of-life for a period of 52-weeks after pituitary-surgery in patients with early GH-substitution (= treated-group, 11-patients) and no GH-substitution (= untreated group, 10-patients).Follow-up-IGF-I-levels of the treated-group stayed within the normal range and differed significantly from the untreated-group. Bioelectrical-impedance-analysis showed a significant decrease of impedance, a significant increase of lean-body-mass and a significant difference in health status in the treated group (p<0.05). Average increase in HDL-level was 2.1mg/dl in the untreated compared to an average decrease of 0.2mg/dl in the treated-group. Lp(a)-levels were reduced by 4.1mg/dl in the treated and by 2.7mg/dl in the untreated-group. Both groups showed an initial-mean-life-satisfaction below average (-0.9 and -1.2). Within one year after surgery mean-health-status improved in both groups. The difference in health-status after 1-year compared to the health-status of the previous year was statistically different between both groups with a greater benefit in the treated-group. Finally there was a trend detectably pointing towards an improvement in pituitary-function (LH- and FSH-recovery) if GH was substituted.Early GH-substitution leads to a significant improvement in quality-of-life and body-composition after pituitary-surgery. It is possible that pituitary-function recovers more with early-GH-substitution.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726277","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.439937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.309368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.229839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Substituent","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituent"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Corticotropic cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticotropic_cell"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Substitution reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_reaction"},{"name":"Benefit (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_(album)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
