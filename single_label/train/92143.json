{"id":92143,"title":"Osteoinductivity of gelatin/?-tricalcium phosphate sponges loaded with different concentrations of mesenchymal stem cells and bone morphogenetic protein-2 in an equine bone defect model.","abstract":"Fracture is one of the most life-threatening injuries in horses. Fracture repair is often associated with unsatisfactory outcomes and is associated with a high incidence of complications. This study aimed to evaluate the osteogenic effects of gelatin/?-tricalcium phosphate (GT) sponges loaded with different concentrations/ratios of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in an equine bone defect model. Seven thoroughbred horses were used in this study. Eight bone defects were created in the third metatarsal bones of each horse. Then, eight treatments, namely control, GT, GT/M-5, GT/M-6, GT/M-5/B-1, GT/M-5/B-3, GT/M-6/B-1, and GT/M-6/B-3 were applied to the eight different sites in a randomized manner (M-5: 2?×?10(5) MSCs; M-6: 2?×?10(6) MSCs; B-1: 1 ?g of BMP-2; B-3: 3 ?g of BMP-2). Repair of bone defects was assessed by radiography, quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and histopathological evaluation. Radiographic scores and CT values were significantly lower in the control group than in the other groups, while they were significantly higher in the GT/M-5/B-3 and GT/M-6/B-3 groups than in the other groups. The amount of mature compact bone filling the defects was greater in the GT/M-5/B-3 and GT/M-6/B-3 groups than in the other groups. The present study demonstrated that the GT sponge loaded with MSCs and BMP-2 promoted bone regeneration in an equine bone defect model. The GT/MSC/BMP-2 described here may be useful for treating horses with bone injuries.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442646","annotations":[{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.815465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.692248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.662454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.631481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Sponge","weight":0.587352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Thoroughbred","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.421066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.383573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.167108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"M6 motorway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M6_motorway"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein 2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein_2"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Equus (genus)","weight":0.0203168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(genus)"},{"name":"Compact space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space"},{"name":"Niacin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"G-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force"},{"name":"2100s (decade)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2100s_(decade)"},{"name":"Guatemala","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Third metatarsal bone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_metatarsal_bone"},{"name":"6B (Fringe)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6B_(Fringe)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"M5 motorway","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M5_motorway"}]}
