{"id":51244,"title":"The incidence of diabetes among 0-34 year olds in Sweden: new data and better methods.","abstract":"We reassessed the validity of previously reported incidence rates for type 1 diabetes in 0-34 year olds in Sweden. We estimated new incidence rates through three nationwide registers.We used capture-recapture methods to assess ascertainment in the Diabetes Incidence Study in Sweden (DISS) and estimated incidence rates in the 20-34 year age group for 2007-2009. We examined whether incidence rates in patients aged 34 and younger could be estimated through the Prescribed Drug Register (PDR) via a proxy for diagnosis of type 1 diabetes; men with at least one and women with at least three prescriptions for insulin were included if they had not been given oral glucose-lowering drugs. We scrutinised the proxy by comparing incidence rates in patients aged 14 and younger with the Swedish Childhood Diabetes Register (SCDR), which has 95-99% ascertainment, and by assessing diabetes type among 18-34 year olds in the National Diabetes Register (NDR).Incidence rates were two to three times higher than previously reported. The absolute number of cases (2007-2009, age 20-34) was 435 in the DISS, 923 in the NDR, 1,217 in the PDR, 1,431 in all three and 1,617 per the capture-recapture method. Ascertainment in the DISS was ~29% for 2007-2009. The proxy diagnosis in the PDR was highly reliable, while the capture-recapture method presumably generated an overestimate.The incidence of type 1 diabetes in patients aged 34 and younger was two to three times higher than previously reported. The PDR can be used to reliably assess incidence rates in this age group.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710965","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.61933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.502593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.472774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.41342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.410964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.104275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Norddeutscher Rundfunk","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norddeutscher_Rundfunk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"431","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/431"},{"name":"1834","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1834"},{"name":"217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/217"},{"name":"923","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/923"},{"name":"Dimensionless quantity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity"},{"name":"Register (sociolinguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)"},{"name":"High availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability"},{"name":"Proxy (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(statistics)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"}]}
