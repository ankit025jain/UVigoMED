{"id":63348,"title":"Laparoscopic management of hypertrophic hypersecretory gastropathy with protein loss: a case report.","abstract":"Hypertrophic hypersecretory gastropathy with protein loss (HHGP) is a rare form of acquired gastropathy characterized by giant gastric rugal folds and hypoalbuminemia. It is often misdiagnosed as Ménétrier's disease. We report the case of a 45-year-old man with HHGP who presented with nausea and anorexia. The patient had no underlying disease and was not on medication. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and CT showed a thickening of the gastric folds in the stomach. As cancer cells were not detected on endoscopic biopsies, the patient was diagnosed with Ménétrier's disease. He was managed with a high-protein diet and annual follow-up by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Five years after the diagnosis, the patient underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for refractory abdominal pain, diarrhea, and protein loss. A pathological diagnosis of HHGP was made and he was discharged without any surgical complications. The patient was relieved of anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy could be regarded as a treatment option for HHGP.
