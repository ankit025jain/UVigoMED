{"id":86171,"title":"Emergent surgical pulmonary embolectomy in a pregnant woman: case report and literature review.","abstract":"Acute pulmonary embolism is a leading cause of death during pregnancy and delivery in the United States. We describe the case of a 25-year-old woman who presented in cardiogenic shock in week 38 of her first pregnancy. After the emergent cesarean delivery of a healthy male neonate, the mother underwent immediate surgical pulmonary embolectomy. We confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism intraoperatively by means of transesophageal echocardiography and removed large clots from the patient's pulmonary arteries. Mother and child were doing well, 27 months later. In addition to presenting our patient's case, we discuss the other relevant reports and the options for treating massive pulmonary embolism during pregnancy.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24808782","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Cardiogenic shock","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiogenic_shock"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Embolectomy","weight":0.592099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolectomy"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.409335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.185579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Pulmonary thrombectomy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_thrombectomy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Mother","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother"},{"name":"Transesophageal echocardiography","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transesophageal_echocardiography"}]}
