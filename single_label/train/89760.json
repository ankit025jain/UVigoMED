{"id":89760,"title":"[Photodocumentation during autopsy].","abstract":"Photography during autopsy is an important part of forensic imaging and essential for the documentation of autopsy findings. A forensic photograph mainly serves the purpose of providing evidence and should be authentic. But aesthetic artwork may improve both the attractiveness and acceptance of autopsies and thus help to increase the autopsy rate. Different materials were compared to each other as photographic backdrop, particularly with regard to reflection and contrast, stability of exposure measurement and monitoring of colour fidelity. The photofoil 9010 Dove Grey proved to be a material of outstanding quality. In practical application, the foil was scratch-resistant and easy to clean. Furthermore, backdrop boards with a gap, e.g. for head and neck, allow special perspectives without a distracting background.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683872","annotations":[{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.6407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.48997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Foil (fencing)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(fencing)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Chroma key","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key"},{"name":"Authentication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Grey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Columbidae","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Reflection (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"},{"name":"Fidelity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity"},{"name":"Physical attractiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness"},{"name":"Work of art","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_of_art"}]}
