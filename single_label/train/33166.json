{"id":33166,"title":"Anaesthesia of conjoined twins - case series.","abstract":"As any complex surgical procedure, separation of conjoined twins requires complex anaesthesia management that is a prerequisite of performing the operation, while complex postoperative care is a decisive factor in the survival of the patients. The paper describes the anaesthetic management for surgical operations in ten sets of conjoined twins in the Children's Hospital of Cracow during 1977-2005. The anaesthetic technique and associated problems are summarized.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858964","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.595791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Conjoined twins","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoined_twins"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.107102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Cracow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracow"},{"name":"Childrens Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childrens_Hospital"},{"name":"Twin","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Separation of church and state","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state"}]}
