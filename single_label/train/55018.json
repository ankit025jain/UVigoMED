{"id":55018,"title":"A safe technique for in-the-bag intraocular lens implantation in pediatric cataract surgery.","abstract":"To describe a safe technique for in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in pediatric cataract patients who undergo lens aspiration with primary posterior capsulorhexis and anterior vitrectomy.Sixty eyes of 45 consecutive patients with congenital/developmental cataract underwent lens aspiration with primary posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (PCCC) with anterior vitrectomy and in-the-bag IOL implantation using the described technique of IOL implantation using anterior capsule as support.All eyes had stable IOL at the end of surgery and none of the eyes had lens decentration/dislocation in posterior vitreous.Implantation of in-the-bag IOL is difficult in children who undergo primary PCCC with anterior vitrectomy. Our technique of implanting IOL by pushing it against the back surface of anterior capsule is a safe method and results in no complications related to faulty IOL implantation.","date":"2014-11-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25044136","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.450865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.169941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.105404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Hypertext Transfer Protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Curvilinear coordinates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates"},{"name":"Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Commission_of_the_FIDE_for_Chess_Compositions"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.0104985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"}]}
