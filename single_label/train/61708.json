{"id":61708,"title":"Comparison of platelet parameters in thrombocytopenic patients associated with acute myeloid leukemia and primary immune thrombocytopenia.","abstract":"Thrombocytopenia is caused by insufficient production and excessive destruction of platelets. Recent improvement of automated blood cell analyzers has allowed measurement of several platelet parameters, providing better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of thrombocytopenia. We investigated the significance of platelet parameters in thrombocytopenic patients. Thrombocytopenic patients (platelet <100?×?10/?l) who were newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and primary immune thrombocytopenia were enrolled, and platelet, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, platelet crit, mean platelet component, mean platelet mass, and large platelet count were measured, and the percentages of large platelets were calculated. The parameters were also measured in the reference population. The mean values of each parameter were as follows: platelet, 259?×?10/?l; mean platelet volume, 7.9 fl; platelet distribution width, 51.3%; platelet crit, 0.20%; mean platelet component, 26.0?g/dl; mean platelet mass, 1.9 pg; large platelet, 4.7?×?10/?l; large platelet percentage, 1.7%. In comparison with acute myeloid leukemia patients, patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia showed significantly higher mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, mean platelet component, mean platelet mass, large platelet, and large platelet % (P?<?0.05). Because of increased destruction of platelets, primary immune thrombocytopenia patients have increased mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, mean platelet component, mean platelet mass, large platelet, and large platelet percentage compared with acute myeloid leukemia patients who have ineffective platelet production. Parameters measured by automated analyzer provide better understanding of thrombopoiesis in the bone marrow and the status of the peripheral blood in the clinical field.
