{"id":86621,"title":"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) - potential role of multidetector-row CT (MD-CT) and MR imaging in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the disease.","abstract":"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) can be defined as pulmonary hypertension (resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 25 mm Hg or more determined at right heart catheterization) with persistent pulmonary perfusion defects. It is a rare, but underdiagnosed disease with estimated incidences ranging from 0.5% to 3.8% of patients after an acute pulmonary embolism (PE), and in up to 10% of those with a history of recurrent PE. CTEPH is the only form of pulmonary hypertension that can be surgically treated leading to normalization of pulmonary hemodynamics and exercise capacity in the vast majority of patients. The challenges for imaging in patients with suspected CTEPH are fourfold: the imaging modality should have a high diagnostic accuracy with regard to the presence of CTEPH and allow for differential diagnosis. It should enable detection of patients suitable for PEA with great certainty, and allow for quantification of PH by measuring pulmonary hemodynamics (mPAP and PVR), and finally, it can be used for therapy monitoring. This overview tries to elucidate the potential role of ECG-gated multidetector CT pulmonary angiography (MD-CTPA) and MR imaging, and summarizes the most important results that have been achieved so far. Generally speaking, ECG-gated MD-CTPA is superior to MR in the assessment of parenchymal and vascular pathologies of the lung, and allows for the assessment of cardiac structures. The implementation of iodine maps as a surrogate for lung perfusion enables functional assessment of lung perfusion by CT. MR imaging is the reference standard for the assessment of right heart function and lung perfusion, the latter delineating typical wedge-shaped perfusion defects in patients with CTEPH. New developments show that with MR techniques, an estimation of hemodynamic parameters like mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance will be possible. CT and MR imaging should be considered as complementary investigations providing comprehensive information in patients with CTEPH.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Respiratory Tract
