{"id":50641,"title":"TNFAIP8 overexpression is associated with platinum resistance in epithelial ovarian cancers with optimal cytoreduction.","abstract":"Here, we correlated tumor necrosis factor ?-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression with clinicopathological parameters and investigated the involvement of TNFAIP8 overexpression in platinum resistance of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The status of TNFAIP8 protein was evaluated by Western blot analysis (n = 25) and immunohistochemistry (n = 134). TNFAIP8 mRNA expression was assessed with real-time polymerase chain reaction in fresh frozen EOC tissues (n = 40). TNFAIP8 overexpression at both mRNA and protein levels in platinum-resistant disease was clearly higher than that in platinum-sensitive disease (P < .05). Platinum resistance was independently correlated with residual tumor size (P = .025), ascites (P = .027), and TNFAIP8 overexpression (P = .003). In particular, TNFAIP8 overexpression was correlated with platinum resistance in EOCs with optimal cytoreduction (P = .001). TNFAIP8 mRNA expression was strongly associated with residual tumor size (P = .019). In conclusion, our findings indicate that TNFAIP8 overexpression is an independent predictor of platinum resistance and may be a potential biomarker for targeted therapy.
