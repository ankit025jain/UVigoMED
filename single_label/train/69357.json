{"id":69357,"title":"[Differential expression of genes that encode glycolysis enzymes in kidney and lung cancer in humans].","abstract":"Glycolysis is a main catabolic pathway of glucose metabolism, accompanied by ATP synthesis. More than 30 enzymes are involved in glycolysis, and genes that encode them can be considered housekeeping genes due to the high conservatism and evolutionary antiquity of the process. We studied the expression of these genes in kidney papillary cancer and planocellular lung cancer via the bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome database and method of quantitative real time PCR. Quantitative analysis of mRNA level demonstrated that only a part ofgenes that encode glycolysis enzymes maintain relatively stable mRNA level, including the HK1, ADPGK, GPI, PGK1, and PKM2 genes in kidney papillary cancer and the ADPGK, ALDOA, GAPDH, PGK1, BPGM, ENO1, and PKM2 genes in planocellular lung cancer. The frequent increase in the mRNA expression of PFKP, ALDOA, and GAPDH genes in kidney cancer, as well as the GPI gene in lung cancer, were detected for the first time by real time PCR. For other genes, their differential expression was demonstrated; the cases of both a decrease and increase in the mRNA level were detected. Thus, several genes that can be used as control genes in transcriptome analysis by real time PCR in kidney and lung cancer, as well as a number of differentially expressed genes that can be potential oncomarkers, were identified.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450150","annotations":[{"name":"Glycolysis","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.837401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.823615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.76079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.661411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Transcriptome","weight":0.637452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome"},{"name":"Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase","weight":0.611881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.547422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.429212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.375128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"ATP synthase","weight":0.30029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_synthase"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Housekeeping gene","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housekeeping_gene"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Ancient history","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Aldolase A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldolase_A"},{"name":"Quantitative analysis (chemistry)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(chemistry)"},{"name":"PKM2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKM2"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Glycophosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycophosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
