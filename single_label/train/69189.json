{"id":69189,"title":"Survival benefit from transplantation in patients listed for heart transplantation in the United States.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the survival benefit from heart transplantation (HT), defined as reduction in the risks for 90-day and 1-year mortality on undergoing HT close to listing, in candidates stratified by their risk for waiting list mortality.Among patients listed for HT, those at higher risk for death without transplantation are also at higher risk for early post-transplantation mortality.All patients age ?18 years listed for HT in the United States from 2007 to 2010 were analyzed. A model was developed to predict the risk for waiting list mortality within 90 days, and listed patients were stratified into 10 risk groups (deciles). All groups were followed for 1 year to assess cumulative 1-year mortality while on the waiting list. Models of 90-day and 1-year post-transplantation mortality were developed using recipient data, and these risks were estimated at listing in all listed candidates.Of 10,159 patients listed for HT, 596 (5.9%) died within 90 days and 1,054 (10.4%) within 1 year without undergoing transplantation. Of 5,720 recipients of transplants with 1-year follow-up, 576 (10.1%) died within 1 year. The risk for death while on the waiting list within 90 days increased from 1.6% to 19% across the 10 risk groups. The survival benefit from HT increased progressively with higher risk for death without transplantation (p < 0.001 for trend), but there was no benefit in the first 6 risk groups.The risk for waiting list mortality varies considerably among HT candidates. Although the survival benefit of HT generally increases with increasing risk for waiting list mortality, there is no measurable benefit in many candidates at the lower end of the risk spectrum.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462511","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.665884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.551715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"576","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Survival skills","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_skills"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
