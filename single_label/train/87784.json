{"id":87784,"title":"[The role of sensory peptidergic nerve fibers and neurogenic inflammation in the development of posttraumatic complex regional pain syndrome].","abstract":"To study the involvement of sensory peptidergic fibers in the posttraumatic regional pain syndrome (RPS).We examined 57 patients with distal radial bone fractures (27 with noncomplicated fractures and 30 with the development of posttraumatic RPS) using computed thermography and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) with wavelet-analysis of skin blood flow oscillations.It has been shown that neurogenic inflammation, along with sensory peptidergic fibers activation, is an early component of posttraumatic RPS. Thermographic and LDF criteria for early diagnosis of posttraumatic RPS during the 1st month after the injury are singled out.The microvascular blood flow oscillatory structures, reflected sensory peptidergic activation and inflammatory sympatholysis are the most effective diagnostic signs (diagnostic effectiveness is 91.2%).","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988952","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Complex regional pain syndrome","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_regional_pain_syndrome"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.762925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.754147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.461019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.4375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.392202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.36559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.196653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0562587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Nerve fiber","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber"},{"name":"Neurogenic inflammation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenic_inflammation"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Radius (bone)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_(bone)"}]}
