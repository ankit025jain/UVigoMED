{"id":68245,"title":"The association between the Lys751Gln polymorphism in the XPD gene and the risk of bladder cancer.","abstract":"The Lys751Gln polymorphism in the XPD gene have been suggested as a risk factor for bladder cancer, however the results were inconclusive. The aim of the current study is to assess the association by meta-analysis. A total of 15 case-control studies concerning the association between the XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism and bladder cancer risk were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggested that the Lys751Gln polymorphism was not associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer in the dominant model (OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 0.95-1.11, P = 0.53 for Lys/Gln+Gln/Gln vs. Lys/Lys) in overall analysis. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no significant association was found in Caucasians or Asians. Other comparatives suggested a slight significant association between the polymorphism with the risk of bladder cancer in the recessive comparative (OR = 1.14, 95 % CI 1.02-1.29, P = 0.03). The current meta-analysis indicated that the Lys751Gln polymorphism in the XPD gene might be a risk factor for bladder cancer. In the future, more large-scale case-control studies are needed to validate our results.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535265","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.846632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.772905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.75226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Glutamine","weight":0.479258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.441369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.381821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.377325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.27107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.268579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"XPD","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPD"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"951","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/951"},{"name":"Battle of the Lys (1918)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Lys_(1918)"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
