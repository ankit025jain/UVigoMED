{"id":74183,"title":"Treatment of malignant gliomas in elderly patients: a concise overview of the literature.","abstract":"Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors and the incidence data has increased in the elderly population. Unfortunately, prospective studies on this population are few and so the right treatment is unknown. In the elderly patients no standard treatment has been established and therefore the optimal treatment should be individualized. We performed a review analyzing the prognostic and predictive factors, the clinical studies, and the correct management of this population.
