{"id":66998,"title":"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms studied for associations with urinary toxicity from (125)I prostate brachytherapy implants.","abstract":"To identify clinical, dosimetric, and genetic factors that are associated with late urinary toxicity after a (125)I prostate brachytherapy implant.Genomic DNA from 296 men treated with (125)I prostate brachytherapy monotherapy was extracted from saliva samples for this study. A retrospective database was compiled including clinical, dosimetric, and toxicity data for this cohort of patients. Fourteen candidate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from 13 genes (TP53, ERCC2, GSTP1, NOS, TGF?1, MSH6, RAD51, ATM, LIG4, XRCC1, XRCC3, GSTA1, and SOD2) were tested in this cohort for correlations with toxicity.This study identified 217 men with at least 2 years of followup. Of these, 39 patients developed Grade ?2 late urinary complications with a transurethral resection of prostate, urethral stricture, gross hematuria, or a sustained increase in their International Prostate Symptom Score. The only clinical or dosimetric factor that was associated with late urinary toxicity was age (p = 0.02). None of the 14 SNPs tested in this study were associated with late urinary toxicity in the univariate analysis.This study identified age as the only variable being associated with late urinary toxicity. However, the small sample size and the candidate gene approach used in this study mean that further investigations are essential. Genome-wide association studies are emerging as the preferred approach for future radiogenomic studies to overcome the limitations from a candidate gene approach.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656733","annotations":[{"name":"Transurethral resection of the prostate","weight":0.906426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transurethral_resection_of_the_prostate"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.829174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.819078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Prostate brachytherapy","weight":0.660967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_brachytherapy"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.574279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"XRCC1","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRCC1"},{"name":"GSTP1","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSTP1"},{"name":"Candidate gene","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_gene"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.287497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.272202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Melanocyte-stimulating hormone","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"RAD51","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD51"},{"name":"MSH6","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSH6"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"LIG4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIG4"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0218165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"}]}
