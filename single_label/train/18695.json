{"id":18695,"title":"Identifying risk factors for surgical site complications after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair: evaluation of the Ventral Hernia Working Group grading system.","abstract":"In 2010, the Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) published a grading system to assess the risk of surgical site complications in patients undergoing ventral hernia repair. This study evaluated the predictive value of the VHWG classification for the surgical outcomes of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) and identified independent factors associated with surgical site infection (SSI) and surgical site occurrence (SSO).A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent LVHR over a 10-year period at two institutions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of SSI and the VHWG definition of SSO were used. Univariable analysis was performed using the Student t-test, analysis of variance, chi-square test, or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Multivariable analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with SSI and SSO.Differences in American Society of Anesthesiologists class, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tobacco use, hernia type, prior abdominal surgery, prior ventral hernia repair, hernia size, and total infections were identified by grade. There was no difference in SSI or SSO by grade. Multivariable analysis revealed institution and number of prior abdominal operations to be associated with SSI. Institution, prostate disease, and prior ventral hernia repair were associated with SSO.The VHWG classification was unable to predict SSI and SSO and may not be applicable in LVHR. This study identified independent factors associated with SSI and SSO in LVHR. Although further study is warranted to validate these results, the factors presented may be a useful tool to stratify patient risk of SSI and SSO with LVHR.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773169","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.889584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.574244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.563779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.533002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"American Society of Anesthesiologists","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Anesthesiologists"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.280275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.211743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Abdominal surgery","weight":0.128834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_surgery"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
