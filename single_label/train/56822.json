{"id":56822,"title":"[Hemodynamic changes in myopia of different degrees].","abstract":"A total of 78 patients (143 eyes) with low, medium and high degree myopia were assessed. Apart from standard ophthalmological tests, flowmetry and duplex ultrasound of ocular vessels were performed in all cases to evaluate volumetric and velocity parameters of ocular blood flow in relation to the length of anterior-posterior axis and the degree of myopia. It is found that both parameters of regional blood flow progressively decrease as the anterior-posterior axis increases.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624798","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.324869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Coordinate system","weight":0.0485161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system"},{"name":"Transmission medium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium"},{"name":"Duplex ultrasonography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Nucleic acid double helix","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_double_helix"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"}]}
