{"id":69542,"title":"[Comparative clinical and morphological characteristics of incidental and symptomatic renal cell carcinoma].","abstract":"Over the last two decades, marked increase in detection of incidental or asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in developed countries was observed. The study included 268 patients aged from 25 to 92 years with RCC, which underwent evaluation and treatment in urology clinic MRSRCI for the past 5 years. There were no significant differences in the frequency of histological types of RCC between incidental and symptomatic tumors. Among incidental neoplasms with clear- cell structure, tumor with small size--up to 4 cm (T1a stage) and moderate to high degree of differentiation (G 1-2 according Fuhrman) were predominant. Papillary variant of RCC was detected at a higher stage of the disease and characterized by a high degree of nuclear atypia, which indicates its high malignant potential. Chromophobe RCC was usually diagnosed at T3 stage. The average age of men and women with chromophobe RCC was 46.5 +/- 6.8 years; there were no age difference in patients with symptomatic and incidental RCC. Among the benign tumors of the kidneys, angiomyolipoma was most commonly diagnosed--in 13 (53.8%) cases. Thus, incidental tumors have a better prognosis than symptomatic tumors.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437232","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Atypia","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypia"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.558329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.556001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.544448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.420769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.301363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.268501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0585634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Angiomyolipoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiomyolipoma"},{"name":"Chromophobe cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophobe_cell"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Renal papilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_papilla"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
