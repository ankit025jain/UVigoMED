{"id":79621,"title":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis in an immigrant Saudi worker: a case report.","abstract":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), an uncommon disorder in South-East Asia, including Bangladesh, often presents as granulomatous plaque on the exposed areas, with a high index of suspicion required for diagnosis. Here we report the first imported case of CL caused by Leishmania tropica in a migrant Bangladeshi worker in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The case, initially suspected as a case of cutaneous tuberculosis, arrived at specimens reception unit (SRU) of diagnostic labs of icddr,b being referred by the physician for ALS testing for tuberculosis. At his arrival in the SRU, one of the health personnel of the unit who used to work in KSA suspected him as a case of CL. The diagnosis was confirmed by smear microscopy which revealed plenty of amastigotes within macrophages. PCR was performed to confirm the species. He was treated with sodium stibogluconate at Shahid Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, Dhaka.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076674","annotations":[{"name":"Saudi Arabia","weight":0.892072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.886534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Bangladesh","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"},{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.713528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.678183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.6365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.631347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.592289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.561506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.50236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.371893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Sodium stibogluconate","weight":0.365403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_stibogluconate"},{"name":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis","weight":0.365368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Amastigote","weight":0.263714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amastigote"},{"name":"Dhaka","weight":0.255391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka"},{"name":"Arabian Peninsula","weight":0.248824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.243345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.162827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Leishmania tropica","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania_tropica"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huseyn_Shaheed_Suhrawardy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Shahid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Telecommunication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication"}]}
