{"id":68115,"title":"A self-tuning adaptive controller for 3-D image-guided ultrasound cancer therapy.","abstract":"One of the challenges in MRI-controlled hyperthermia cancer treatment for localized tumor is that the tissue properties are dynamic and difficult to measure. Therefore, tuning the optimal gains for a constant gain controller can be challenging. In this paper, a new multi-input single-output adaptive controller strategy is proposed to address these problems. The inputs to the controller block are the frequency, rotation rate, and applied power level of an interstitial applicator, and the output is the boundary temperature during treatment. The time-varying gains of the new controller are updated over time using Lyapunov-based stability analysis. The robustness of the new controller to changes in the parameters of the tissue is investigated and compared to a constant gain controller through simulation studies. Simulations take into account changes in tissue properties and other conditions that may be encountered in a practical clinical situation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated through an experimental study.
