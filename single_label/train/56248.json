{"id":56248,"title":"Potential for daily supplementation of n-3 fatty acids to reverse symptoms of dry eye in mice.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the change in tear volume, as a predominant symptom of dry eye syndrome, in dietary n-3 fatty acid deficient mice compared with n-3 fatty acid adequate mice. The tear volume in n-3 fatty acid deficient mice was significantly lower than that in n-3 fatty acid adequate mice. In addition, the concentration of n-3 fatty acid in the lacrimal and meibomian glands, which affects the production of tears, was markedly decreased compared with n-3 fatty acid adequate mice. However, the tear volume recovered almost completely after one week of continuous administration of fish oil containing EPA and DHA in n-3 fatty acid deficient mice. Also, the concentration of DHA in the meibomian gland of n-3 fatty acid deficient group recovered to approximately 80% more than that of n-3 fatty acid adequate group. These results suggested that dietary n-3 fatty acids deficiency showed reversible dry eye syndrome, and that n-3 fatty acids have an important role in the production of tears.
