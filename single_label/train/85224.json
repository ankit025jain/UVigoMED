{"id":85224,"title":"\"Open lung ventilation optimizes pulmonary function during lung surgery\".","abstract":"We evaluated an \"open lung\" ventilation (OV) strategy using low tidal volumes, low respiratory rate, low FiO2, and high continuous positive airway pressure in patients undergoing major lung resections.In this phase I pilot study, twelve consecutive patients were anesthetized using conventional ventilator settings (CV) and then OV strategy during which oxygenation and lung compliance were noted. Subsequently, a lung resection was performed. Data were collected during both modes of ventilation in each patient, with each patient acting as his own control. The postoperative course was monitored for complications.Twelve patients underwent open thoracotomies for seven lobectomies and five segmentectomies. The OV strategy provided consistent one-lung anesthesia and improved static compliance (40 ± 7 versus 25 ± 4 mL/cm H2O, P = 0.002) with airway pressures similar to CV. Postresection oxygenation (SpO2/FiO2) was better during OV (433 ± 11 versus 386 ± 15, P = 0.008). All postoperative chest x-rays were free of atelectasis or infiltrates. No patient required supplemental oxygen at any time postoperatively or on discharge. The mean hospital stay was 4 ± 1 d. There were no complications or mortality.The OV strategy, previously shown to have benefits during mechanical ventilation of patients with respiratory failure, proved safe and effective in lung resection patients. Because postoperative pulmonary complications may be directly attributable to the anesthetic management, adopting an OV strategy that optimizes lung mechanics and gas exchange may help reduce postoperative problems and improve overall surgical results. A randomized trial is planned to ascertain whether this technique will reduce postoperative pulmonary complications.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25033701","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Positive airway pressure","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Pulmonary compliance","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_compliance"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Atelectasis","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelectasis"},{"name":"Respiratory rate","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_rate"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.761851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Gas exchange","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_exchange"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.711665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"FiO2","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiO2"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.597633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.569549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.547712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.27621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.161848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Oxygen mask","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_mask"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
