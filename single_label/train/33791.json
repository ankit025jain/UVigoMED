{"id":33791,"title":"The use of high-dose hydroxocobalamin for vasoplegic syndrome.","abstract":"We describe a case of hypotension on cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass grafting, double valve repairs, and patent foramen ovale closure. The patient experienced vasoplegic syndrome while on cardiopulmonary bypass. He was treated with high-dose hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12). His blood pressure responded rapidly, obviating any further vasopressor requirements.
