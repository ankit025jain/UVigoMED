{"id":44449,"title":"Cladosporol A, a new peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) ligand, inhibits colorectal cancer cells proliferation through ?-catenin/TCF pathway inactivation.","abstract":"Cladosporol A, a secondary metabolite from Cladosporium tenuissimum, exhibits antiproliferative properties in human colorectal cancer cells by modulating the expression of some cell cycle genes (p21(waf1/cip1), cyclin D1).PPAR? activation by cladosporol A was studied by overexpression and RNA interference assays. The interactions between PPAR? and Sp1 were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation and ChIp assays. ?-Catenin subcellular distribution and ?-catenin/TCF pathway inactivation were analyzed by western blot and RTqPCR, respectively. Cladosporol A-induced ?-catenin proteasomal degradation was examined in the presence of the specific inhibitor MG132.Cladosporol A inhibits cell growth through upregulation of p21(waf1/cip1) gene expression mediated by Sp1-PPAR? interaction. Exposure of HT-29 cells to cladosporol A causes ?-catenin nuclear export, proteasome degradation and reduced expression of its target genes. Upon treatment, PPAR? also activates E-cadherin gene at the mRNA and protein levels.In this work we provide evidence that PPAR? mediates the anti-proliferative action of cladosporol A in colorectal cancer cells. Upon ligand activation, PPAR? interacts with Sp1 and stimulates p21(waf1/cip1) gene transcription. PPAR? activation causes degradation of ?-catenin and inactivation of the downstream target pathway and, in addition, upregulates E-cadherin expression reinforcing cell-cell interactions and a differentiated phenotype.We elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which PPAR? mediates the anticancer activity of cladosporol A.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Digestive System
