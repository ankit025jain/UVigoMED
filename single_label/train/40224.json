{"id":40224,"title":"Advantages of minimal incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","abstract":"Modifications to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) are aimed at decreasing abdominal wall trauma and improving cosmetic outcome. Although single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) provides excellent cosmetic results, the procedure is technically challenging and expensive compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach.To describe a novel, hybrid technique combining SILS and conventional laparoscopy using minimal abdominal wall incisions.Fifty patients diagnosed with symptomatic cholelithiasis were operated using two reusable 5 mm trocars inserted through a single 15 mm umbilical incision and a single 2-3 mm epigastric port. This technique was clubbed \"minimal incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy\" (MILC).MILC was completed in 49 patients (98%). In five patients an additional 3 mm trocar was used and in 2 patients the epigastric trocar was switched to a 5 mmtrocar. The procedure was converted to CLC in one patient. Mean operative time was 29 minutes (range 18-60) and the average postoperative hospital stay was 22 hours (range 6-50). There were no postoperative complications and the cosmetic results were rated excellent by the patients.MILC is an intuitive, easy-to-learn and reproducible technique and requires small changes from CLC. As such, MILC may be an attractive alternative, avoiding the cost and complexity drawbacks associated with SILS.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25058998","annotations":[{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.822029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.737917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.554984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.443911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.341017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Trocar","weight":0.228312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocar"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0940385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Navel","weight":0.0396407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1860","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860"},{"name":"650","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/650"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Port","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port"},{"name":"Intuition (knowledge)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Reusability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability"},{"name":"Nail clubbing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_clubbing"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"}]}
