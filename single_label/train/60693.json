{"id":60693,"title":"Predictive value of risk assessment scores in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","abstract":"Reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIC allo-SCT) is associated with less toxicity and is used for older patients. We retrospectively studied the predictive value of two risk assessment scores, which were the hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) and the pre-transplantation assessment of mortality (PAM) score, for assessing the outcome of RIC allo-SCT. Seventy-eight patients underwent transplantation between 2005 and 2013 at a single institution. RIC was performed with fludarabine and melphalan with/without total body irradiation. The 3-year overall survival of patients with an HCT-CI >3 was significantly worse than that of patients with an HCT-CI 0-3 (31.6% vs. 59.6%, P?=?0.020). Also, the 3-year overall survival of patients with a PAM score >24 was significantly worse than that of those with a PAM score ?24 (29.2% vs. 61.4%, P?=?0.005). The present findings suggest that changing the cut-off values of these risk assessment scores can improve prediction of outcomes in patients receiving RIC allo-SCT with this conditioning regimen and we need validation by large-scale study with other regimens.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845702","annotations":[{"name":"Melphalan","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melphalan"},{"name":"Fludarabine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludarabine"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.807902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Total body irradiation","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_body_irradiation"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.455425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.400559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"1 decametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decametre"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Predictive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_medicine"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Royal Irish Constabulary","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Irish_Constabulary"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"}]}
