{"id":81855,"title":"Effectiveness of a fixed anterior bite plane in Class II deep-bite patients.","abstract":"Orthodontic treatment of patients with distoclusion combined with dental deep bite and linguo version of the front upper teeth is one of the most difficult forms of malocclusion to treat to a functional and morphological optimum. Our objective was to analyze the efficacy of a fixed anterior bite plane appliance to disclude the teeth and correct this type of malocclusion. At the Department of Orthodontics MSUMD (Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry), we proposed the use of a fixed anterior bite plane for the effective treatment of patients with distoclusion combined to a dental deep bite. This appliance was used in 35 patients aged 11 to 15 years (13.2 +/- 1.2) with distoclusion combined with deep bite in a therapeutical approach that also involved an osteopathic correction. The appliance permitted the correction of the distoclusion by discluding the posterior teeth, allowing eruption of the molars and premolars which improved the occlusal plane line (Curve of Spee) and changed the inclination of the upper incisors which liberated the mandible from its retruded position. We also noted an effect on the postural status of the patient.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812736","annotations":[{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.75769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.75467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.696827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.651102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.631629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.536913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.427204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.118784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0529744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"Moscow State University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University"},{"name":"Maximilian von Spee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_von_Spee"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Curve (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_(band)"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"},{"name":"Osteopathic medicine in the United States","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathic_medicine_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Classes of United States Senators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"}]}
