{"id":90741,"title":"Simultaneous repair of multiple aortic aneurysms: be courageous in minimally invasive era.","abstract":"The simultaneous treatment of multiple ruptured aortic aneurysms is a surgical challenge. Here we present a case of a 53-year-old woman with Marfan syndrome who had annuloaortic ectasia of 4.2 cm and a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm of 6 cm. The patient developed acute aortic dissection complicated with cardiac tamponade and thoracoabdominal aortic rupture. An emergency operation, which included a Bentall operation, total arch replacement, and thoracoabdominal repair, was performed for 2 remote aneurysms. By paying particular attention to organ perfusion, a single-stage operation was successfully performed and the patient fully recovered.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24580920","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac tamponade","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_tamponade"},{"name":"Marfan syndrome","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Aortic dissection","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.617802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.341032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Traumatic aortic rupture","weight":0.286895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_aortic_rupture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.255867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Annuloaortic ectasia","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annuloaortic_ectasia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Dissection (medical)","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_(medical)"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Ectasia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectasia"}]}
