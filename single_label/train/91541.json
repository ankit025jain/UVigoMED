{"id":91541,"title":"Electrocardiogram artifact caused by rigors mimicking narrow complex tachycardia: a case report.","abstract":"The electrocardiogram (ECG) is useful in the diagnosis of cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Rigors due to shivering can cause electrocardiogram artifacts mimicking various cardiac rhythm abnormalities.We describe an 80-year-old Sri Lankan man with an abnormal electrocardiogram mimicking narrow complex tachycardia during the immediate post-operative period. Electrocardiogram changes caused by muscle tremor during rigors could mimic a narrow complex tachycardia.Identification of muscle tremor as a cause of electrocardiogram artifact can avoid unnecessary pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention to prevent arrhythmias.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495378","annotations":[{"name":"Tremor","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremor"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Chills","weight":0.783491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.682034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.662005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Shivering","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivering"},{"name":"Supraventricular tachycardia","weight":0.542297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraventricular_tachycardia"},{"name":"Sinus rhythm","weight":0.165852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_rhythm"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.157444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Sri Lanka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka"},{"name":"Sri","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Artifact (error)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(error)"}]}
