{"id":21984,"title":"An opportunistic human pathogen on the fly: strains of Aspergillus flavus vary in virulence in Drosophila melanogaster.","abstract":"Aspergilloses are fungal diseases in humans and animals that is caused by members of the genus Aspergillus. Aspergillus flavus is an important opportunistic pathogen, second only to A. fumigatus as a cause of human aspergillosis. Differences in virulence among A. flavus isolates from clinical and other substrates and mating types are not well known. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has become a model organism for investigating virulence of human pathogens due to similarities between its immune system and that of mammals. In this study we used D. melanogaster as a model host to compare virulence among A. flavus strains obtained from clinical sources as compared with other substrates, between isolates of different mating types, and between isolates of A. flavus and A. fumigatus. Anesthetized flies were infected with A. flavus; mortality ranged from 15% to >90%. All strains were virulent, but some were significantly more so than others, which in turn led to the wide mortality range. Clinical strains were significantly less virulent than environmental strains, probably because the clinical strains were from culture collections and the environmental strains were recent isolates. Mean virulence did not differ between MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 mating types and the phylogeny of A. flavus isolates did not predict virulence. A. flavus was on average significantly more virulent than A. fumigatus on two lines of wild-type flies, Canton-S and Oregon-R. D. melanogaster is an attractive model to test pathogenicity and could be useful for identifying genes involved in virulence.
