{"id":72488,"title":"Giant phyllode tumour (cystosarcoma) of breast: a rare size recurrent breast lump.","abstract":"Phyllode tumour is a rare fibro-epithelial lesion that accounts for less than 1% of all neoplasms. It occurs in females in the 3rd and 4th decades. In 15% of patients local recurrence occurs and in 20% of patients distal metastasis is seen. Here we are presenting a case of a very rare size recurrent phyllode tumour with malignant changes which was associated with contralateral breast fibro-adenoma. Patient was investigated and operated successfully for right sided mastectomy for recurrent giant phyllode tumour and wide excision for opposite side fibro-adenoma.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968528","annotations":[{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.381376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.350474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.265939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Fibroadenoma","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroadenoma"},{"name":"Breast lump","weight":0.127918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_lump"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"}]}
