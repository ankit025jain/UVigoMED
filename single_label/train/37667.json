{"id":37667,"title":"Relation of aortic stiffness and strain by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to age in repaired tetralogy of fallot.","abstract":"Patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) have abnormal aortic properties. It is not known if this increases the risk for aneurysm formation. We sought to identify clinical and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging patient characteristics associated with worsened aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic strain in patients with repaired TOF. In 124 patients with TOF undergoing CMR (median age 24.6 years, interquartile range 17.8 to 34.2), left and right ventricular volumetric data, aortic PWV, and aortic strain were evaluated. Increased PWV positively correlated with age at repair (r = 0.3, p = 0.001) and cross-sectional ascending aortic area (r = 0.34, p <0.001) and was associated with a history of shunt placement (p = 0.01). Decreased aortic strain also correlated with age at TOF repair (r = -0.5, p <0.001), cross-sectional ascending aortic area (r = -0.43, p <0.001), aortic regurgitation (r = -0.46, p ?0.001), and history of shunt placement (p <0.001). In a multivariate regression model controlling for history of shunt placement, use of cardiac medication, and aortic regurgitation, age at CMR was significantly associated with PWV (p = 0.005), whereas age at repair trended toward significance (p = 0.06). In conclusion, patients with TOF have abnormal aortic properties correlated with greater age, which may be associated with later repair. Longitudinal data are necessary to assess the risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection as the TOF population grows older. Functional imaging of the aorta by CMR may be useful in predicting risk and assessing vascular health.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480147","annotations":[{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Aortic insufficiency","weight":0.80816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_insufficiency"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.732957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.699309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.650976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.470812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.248163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.234541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0783418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Functional imaging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_imaging"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"}]}
