{"id":38745,"title":"Management of tetralogy of Fallot with unilateral absence of pulmonary artery: an overview.","abstract":"Tetralogy of Fallot with unilateral absence of pulmonary artery (PA) is a rare congenital anomaly that has been reported in isolated case reports and small case series. There is no well-defined treatment algorithm for these patients, and repair has been associated with high mortality, although survival is improving in the more recent era. Recent reports suggest strict case selection criteria based on PA dimensions and size of the left ventricle.
