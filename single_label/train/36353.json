{"id":36353,"title":"Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings in cryptogenic stroke patients under 60 years with patent foramen ovale.","abstract":"To compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain feature in cryptogenic stroke patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO), cryptogenic stroke patients without PFO and patients with cardioembolic stroke.The ethics committee required neither institutional review board approval nor informed patient consent for retrospective analyses of the patients' medical records and imaging data. The patients' medical files were retrospectively reviewed in accordance with human subject research protocols. Ninety-two patients under 60 years of age were included: 15 with cardioembolic stroke, 32 with cryptogenic stroke with PFO and 45 with cryptogenic stroke without PFO. Diffusion-weighted imaging of brain MRI was performed by a radiologist blinded to clinical data. Univariate, Fischer's exact test for qualitative data and non-parametric Wilcoxon test for quantitative data were used.There was no statistically significant difference found between MRI features of patients with PFO and those with cardioembolic stroke (p<.05). Patients without PFO present more corticosubcortical single lesions (p<.05) than patients with PFO. Patients with PFO have more often subcortical single lesions larger than 15mm, involvement of posterior cerebral arterial territory and intracranial occlusion (p<.05) than patients with cryptogenic stroke without PFO.Our study suggests a cardioembolic mechanism in ischemic stroke with PFO.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
