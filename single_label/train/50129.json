{"id":50129,"title":"Initial presentation and late results of treatment of post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinoma in children and adolescents of Belarus.","abstract":"The aim of this population-based study was to evaluate the clinical and pathological characteristics and outcome of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) that have arisen in the Belarusian childhood population exposed to the radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident within a long-term period.The long-term treatment results were investigated in 1078 children and adolescents (<19 years old) with PTC who were surgically treated during the years 1990 through 2005.Patients had high rates of metastatic PTC at presentation, with 73.8% of cases having lymph node involvement and 11.1% having distant spread. The most influential factor for lymph node metastases at initial treatment was lymphatic vessel invasion (P < .0001) and for distant metastases, lateral lymph node involvement (P < .0001). The overall survival was 96.9% ± 0.9% with a median follow-up of 16.21 years, and 20-year event-free survival and relapse-free survival were 87.8% ± 1.6% and 92.3% ± 0.9%, respectively. Patients had significantly lower probability of both loco-regional (P < .001) and distant relapses (P = .005) after total thyroidectomy (TT) and radioactive iodine therapy (RAI). For loco-regional relapses after TT, only RAI influenced the prognosis significantly (P < .001). For distant relapses after TT, the refusal to treat with RAI (hazard ratio [HR] = 9.26), vascular invasion (HR = 8.68), and age at presentation (HR = 6.13) were significant risk factors. For loco-regional relapses after non-TT, the principal risk factors were age less than 15 years old at presentation (HR = 5.34) and multifocal growth of tumor (HR = 5.19). For distant relapses after non-TT, the lateral neck metastases were the only unfavorable factor (HR = 9.26).The outcome of PTC both in children and in adolescents exposed to the post-Chernobyl radioiodine fallout was rather favorable. TT with RAI is recommended for minimizing loco-regional or distant relapses.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24823453","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.879512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.844261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Chernobyl disaster","weight":0.841285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Iodine-131","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymphatic vessel","weight":0.759893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_vessel"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.316177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.28521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Nuclear fallout","weight":0.205941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fallout"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"RAI","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAI"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Belarus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"}]}
