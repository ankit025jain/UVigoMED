{"id":17613,"title":"Predictive factors of post-discharge surgical site infections among patients from a teaching hospital.","abstract":"Surgical site infections (SSIs) often manifest after patients are discharged and are missed by hospital-based surveillance.We conducted a case-reference study nested in a prospective cohort of patients from six surgical specialties in a teaching hospital. The factors related to SSI were compared for cases identified during the hospital stay and after discharge.Among 3,427 patients, 222 (6.4%) acquired an SSI. In 138 of these patients, the onset of the SSI occurred after discharge. Neurological surgery and the use of steroids were independently associated with a greater likelihood of SSI diagnosis during the hospital stay.Our results support the idea of a specialty-based strategy for post-discharge SSI surveillance.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861301","annotations":[{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.77878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.566181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.509074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.440208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.235821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"222","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/222"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
