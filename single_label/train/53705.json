{"id":53705,"title":"[The results of endoscopy-assisted microsurgical treatment of giant adenomas of hypophysis].","abstract":"Experience of rational combined application of microscope or endoscope while excision of giant adenomas of the hypophysis (GAH), using transsphenoidal approach, was summarized. Of 87 patients, operated for GAH during last 5 yrs, 34--were operated with combined application of operative microscope and endoscope. Convenience for surgeon, traumaticity and efficacy, chronometry of surgical interventions were estimated. In 12 patients a complete excision of GAH was achieved, in 18--almost complete (90% and more), in 4--subtotal (range 70 - 90%). In all the patients postoperatively a positive clinical dynamics was noted and a new stable neurological or endocrinal disorders were absent. While application of endoscope the duration of microsurgical interventions appears by 10 - 30 min enhanced. Combination of microscopic and endoscopic techniques in surgery of GAH have permitted to use the advantages and escape the disadvantages of every of them, to guarantee satisfactory functional results of treatment.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502013","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.729148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.567928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Operating microscope","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_microscope"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Rationalism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Marine chronometer","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_chronometer"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Convenience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"}]}
