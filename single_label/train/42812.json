{"id":42812,"title":"Current epidemiology of hepatitis E virus infection in the United States: low seroprevalence in the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey.","abstract":"Analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994 dataset found a relatively high seroprevalence (21%) of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in the U.S. general population. Using data obtained within the NHANES 2009-2010 survey, where a high performance assay for HEV was used, we estimated the weighted seroprevalence of HEV infection among U.S. individuals 6 years and older. We also evaluated factors associated with HEV seropositivity. A total of 8,814 individuals were included in the analysis. The median age of study participants was 37 years (interquartile range [IQR] 17-58 years), with 51.2% being female. The weighted national seroprevalence of HEV was 6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1%-6.9%). About 0.5% of those with HEV had evidence of recent exposure (immunoglobulin M-positive). In the univariate analyses, factors associated with HEV seropositivity were increasing age (P-trend<0.001), birth outside of the U.S., Hispanic race, and \"meat\" consumption (>10 times/month). No significant association was observed with low socioeconomic status, water source, or level of education. In the multivariate analysis, only older age remained predictive of HEV seropositivity.The weighted national seroprevalence of HEV in the U.S. is much less than previously reported. Using data obtained with a high performance assay, the seroprevalence of HEV was estimated at 6.0% in the U.S. Based on these results, the seroprevalence of HEV is only one-third as high as previously reported.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Digestive System
