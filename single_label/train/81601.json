{"id":81601,"title":"Bizarre tooth surface loss and the Miswak stick.","abstract":"Tooth surface loss can present in a variety of ways, some of which can appear rather strange on first examination. This case report demonstrates an unusual presentation of tooth surface loss (TSL) and its subsequent treatment. This loss of hard dental tissue appeared to be affecting the whole of the patient's remaining dentition, both lingually and buccally. Detailed questioning revealed the origins of this problem which turned out to be due to excessive use of an intra-oral Miswak chewing stick. Cinical Relevance: This article will enable clinicians to understand the importance of specific, targeted history-taking, involving a rare case of tooth surface loss as well as the use of minimally destructive restoration composites and a fibre-reinforced composite bridge.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930258","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.524889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.314018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.300935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Miswak","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miswak"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Bizarre (rapper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarre_(rapper)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Ice hockey stick","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_stick"},{"name":"Questioning (sexuality and gender)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questioning_(sexuality_and_gender)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Tasmanian Football League","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Football_League"}]}
