{"id":87248,"title":"[Surgical peculiarities of gunshot injuries to arteries of the extremities caused by modern small arms and light weapons].","abstract":"The aim of the given study was development of surgical tactics in case of femoral artery injury, caused by medium-calibre bullet, on the basis acute experiment on large biological objects. Experimental animals were shot into mid third of the femora by a rifle cartridge in 7,62-mm calibre (AK-47 made in 1943). The analysis of microstructure, made in 5 cross-sections performed every 1-centimetre way from the wound canal, showed that there were no any damages of arterial wall. Authors came to conclusion that the surgical debridement of the gunshot wound, made by a rifle cartridge in 7,62-mm calibre of AK-47, should consist of exsection of devitalized section of artery.","date":"2014-12-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25532307","annotations":[{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.611027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.581271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Bullet","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.487257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.446357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Femoral artery","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_artery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.334742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Caliber","weight":0.213824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliber"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rifle","weight":0.176073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle"},{"name":"Ballistic trauma","weight":0.120689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trauma"},{"name":"Cartridge (firearms)","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"AK-47","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-47"},{"name":"Alaska","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"1943","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"Defensive wall","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_wall"},{"name":"Gunshot","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunshot"},{"name":"Small arms","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_arms"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Microstructure","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstructure"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"}]}
