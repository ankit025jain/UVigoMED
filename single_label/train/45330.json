{"id":45330,"title":"No association between XRCC3 Thr241Met and XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms and the risk of colorectal cancer in West Algerian population: a case-control study.","abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex and multifactorial disease, in which genetic and environmental factors both seem to play a part. Many epidemiological studies have explored the association between genetic polymorphisms of X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 (XRCC3) (Thr241Met) and Xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) lysine to glutamine at codon 751 (Lys751Gln) and risk of CRC in various populations; however, the results are controversial. We conducted this case-control study in a West Algerian population to assess the potential role of this genetic polymorphism on the risk of CRC in this population. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from 129 sporadic CRC patients and 148 normal controls. The polymorphisms were determined by pyrosequencing technique. The distribution of XRCC3 Thr241Met and XPD Lys751Gln genotypes among controls did not differ significantly from those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg distribution (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in the genotypes distribution and allele frequencies between CRC patients and controls. A significant association was found between the combined heterozygous of XRCC3 and homozygous variant of XPD gene and CRC. This is the first study on DNA repair genetic polymorphisms in West Algerian population, and it suggests that the XRCC3 Thr241Met and XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms may not be associated with the CRC risk in this population.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687779","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.814798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.808841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Glutamine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.797641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Xeroderma pigmentosum","weight":0.763007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeroderma_pigmentosum"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.707618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.647915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Threonine","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.637268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.574841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Nature versus nurture","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.418165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.271066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.179746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Pyrosequencing","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosequencing"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Algeria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria"},{"name":"Costa Rica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"West Africa","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa"}]}
