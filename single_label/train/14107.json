{"id":14107,"title":"Is there still any hope for amyloid-based immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease?","abstract":"We reviewed clinical trials on active and passive anti-?-amyloid (A?) immunotherapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with a particular focus on monoclonal antibodies against A?.Studies on anti-Alzheimer's disease immunotherapy published in the period from January 2012 to October 2013 were reviewed.Both active and passive anti-A? immunotherapies were shown to clear brain A? deposits. However, an active anti-A? vaccine (AN1792) has been discontinued because it caused meningoencephalitis in 6% of Alzheimer's disease patients treated. Among passive immunotherapeutics, two Phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at the N-terminal sequence of A?, were disappointing. Another antibody, solanezumab, directed at the mid-region of A?, failed in two Phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. A third Phase III study with solanezumab is ongoing in mildly affected Alzheimer's disease patients based on encouraging results in this subgroup of patients. Second-generation active A? vaccines (ACC-001, CAD106, and Affitope AD02) and new passive anti-A? immunotherapies (gantenerumab and crenezumab) are being tested in prodromal Alzheimer's disease patients, in presymptomatic individuals with Alzheimer's disease-related mutations, or in asymptomatic individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease to definitely test the A? cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445401","annotations":[{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.771688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Prodrome","weight":0.570028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrome"},{"name":"Bapineuzumab","weight":0.481686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bapineuzumab"},{"name":"Humanized antibody","weight":0.357838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_antibody"},{"name":"Meningoencephalitis","weight":0.280998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningoencephalitis"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.186716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Computer-aided design","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"}]}
