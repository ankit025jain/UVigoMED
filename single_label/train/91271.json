{"id":91271,"title":"Influence of systemic bisphosphonate treatment on mechanical properties of BMP-induced calluses in a rat fracture model: comparison of three-point bending and twisting test.","abstract":"The combination of autograft, BMP and bisphosphonate has been shown to produce strong calluses. In this study, without autograft we investigate the effect of bisphosphonate treatment on BMP-induced calluses, both in bending and in rotation. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 42) underwent femoral osteotomy and BMP-7 treatment. At 2 weeks an injection of saline or bisphosphonate was administered. The animals were sacrificed after 6 weeks. Both femurs were tested in either three-point bending or twisting. All femurs healed. BMP + bisphosphonate-treatment led to larger calluses (p < 0.05) and in three-point bending, higher ultimate force (p < 0.01) and greater stiffness (p < 0.05) than BMP alone. The BMP + bisphosphonate group was nearly 60% stronger than controls, while the BMP group did not reach the strength (p < 0.05) nor stiffness (p < 0.01) of the controls. In the twisting test, similar trends were found but less pronounced. Three-point bending produced transverse callus associated fractures, whereas the twisting test produced spiral fractures, located in the structurally weaker distal femur. BMP + bisphosphonate-treatment produces calluses that are mechanically superior to calluses induced by BMP alone, when tested both in three-point bending and in twisting. For the mechanical evaluation of pharmacologically enhanced calluses with breaking strengths exceeding the native bone, the bending test is recommended.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522981","annotations":[{"name":"Ultimate tensile strength","weight":0.811273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.777761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.522563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.457999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.428812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.427496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.33224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.272342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.265155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.116512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein 7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein_7"},{"name":"Continuum mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Spiral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral"},{"name":"Bending","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"},{"name":"Arthropod leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod_leg"},{"name":"Indigenous (ecology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_(ecology)"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transverse plane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
