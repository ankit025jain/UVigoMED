{"id":7358,"title":"Effects of acute and sub-chronic L-dopa therapy on striatal L-dopa methylation and dopamine oxidation in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinsons disease.","abstract":"The molecular mechanisms for the loss of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa) efficacy during the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) are unknown. Modifications related to catecholamine metabolism such as changes in l-dopa and dopamine (DA) metabolism, the modulation of catecholamine enzymes and the production of interfering metabolites are the primary concerns of this study.Normal (saline) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) pre-treated mice were primed with 100mg/kg of l-dopa twice a day for 14 days, and a matching group remained l-dopa naïve. l-dopa naive and primed mice received a challenge dose of 100mg/kg of l-dopa and were sacrificed 30 min later. Striatal catecholamine levels and the expression and activity of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) were determined.Normal and MPTP pre-treated animals metabolize l-dopa and DA similarly during l-dopa therapy. Administration of a challenge dose of l-dopa increased l-dopa and DA metabolism in l-dopa naïve animals, and this effect was enhanced in l-dopa primed mice. The levels of 3-OMD in MPTP pre-treated animals were almost identical to those in normal mice, which we found are likely due to increased COMT activity in MPTP pre-treated mice.The results of this comparative study provide evidence that sub-chronic administration of l-dopa decreases the ability of the striatum to accumulate l-dopa and DA, due to increased metabolism via methylation and oxidation. This data supports evidence for the metabolic adaptation of the catecholamine pathway during long-term treatment with l-dopa, which may explain the causes for the loss of l-dopa efficacy.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880075","annotations":[{"name":"Catecholamine","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Catechol-O-methyl transferase","weight":0.856875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechol-O-methyl_transferase"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.630593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.556423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.482254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.45232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Phenyl group","weight":0.233754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenyl_group"},{"name":"MPTP","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPTP"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0471911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Dihydroxyphenylalanine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydroxyphenylalanine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Priming (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)"}]}
