{"id":62153,"title":"How I treat the peripheral T-cell lymphomas.","abstract":"The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) encompass a heterogeneous group of diseases that have generally been associated with poor prognosis. The most common PTCLs, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK-negative), despite their unique presentations and histologies, are currently treated similarly. Here we discuss our general approach to the treatment of the most common PTCLs. Based on the best data currently available, which include retrospective analyses and phase 2 prospective studies, our approach has involved cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone-based therapy followed by consolidation in first remission with autologous stem cell transplant. This treatment strategy likely improves the outcome for patients compared with historical series; however, progression-free survival rates remain disappointing, ranging from 40% to 50%. This is currently an exciting time in the treatment of PTCL due to the advent of recently approved drugs as well as new targeted agents currently under investigation. In addition, gene expression profiling is allowing for a better understanding of underlying disease biology, improved diagnostic accuracy, and prognostication in PTCL. As a result, over the next few years, we expect a significant shift in our management of these diseases with a move toward more individualized therapy leading to improved outcomes.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615779","annotations":[{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.735738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.494766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.47636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma","weight":0.260458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_large-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.256056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Anaplasia","weight":0.254754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplasia"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.221043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase","weight":0.190579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_lymphoma_kinase"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.140885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Large cell","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_cell"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
