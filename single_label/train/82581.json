{"id":82581,"title":"The CPP-ACP relieved enamel erosion from a carbonated soft beverage: an in vitro AFM and XRD study.","abstract":"To investigate the CPP-ACP's effect on enamel against carbonated beverage erosion and explore the potential mechanism.A total of 30 enamel samples were prepared from sound bovine incisors, divided into 3 groups. Samples in the control group were kept in artificial saliva. Specimens' surfaces were smeared with a CPP-ACP agent (Tooth Mousse, TM) for 3 min, rinsed with distilled water for 10s, merged into cola (Coca Cola, CC) for 4 intervals of 2 min, rinsed again for the TM+CC group. In the CC group, specimens were treated solely with cola for 4 intervals (2 min each). The cycles were applied at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h. The surface microhardness (SMH) alterations were measured using a microhardness tester, the surface profiles were analyzed using the atomic force microscope, and the surface crystalline amount (I%) and crystallinity (FWHM) were analyzed using X-ray diffractometer.The SMH were significantly decreased in CC group, showing the largest SMH alteration; the reduction of SMH in TM+CC group was lower than that in CC group, still larger than control. After cycles, the TM+CC group showed rougher surfaces than control, while the CC group had the roughest surfaces. The TM+CC had an I% higher than the CC, and lower than the control. The TM+CC group had a FWHM lower than CC, higher than control.CPP-ACP was able to relieve the erosion on enamel from carbonated beverage.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic
