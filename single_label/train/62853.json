{"id":62853,"title":"Disorders of neutrophil function: an overview.","abstract":"Primary disorders of neutrophil function result from impairment in neutrophil responses that are critical for host defense. This chapter summarizes inherited disorders of neutrophils that cause defects in neutrophil adhesion, migration, and oxidative killing. These include the leukocyte adhesion deficiencies, actin defects, and other disorders of chemotaxis, hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, Ch√©diak-Higashi syndrome, neutrophil-specific granule deficiency, chronic granulomatous disease, and myeloperoxidase deficiency. Diagnostic tests and treatment approaches are also summarized for each neutrophil disorder.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504971","annotations":[{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Chronic granulomatous disease","weight":0.83257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_granulomatous_disease"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.613139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.427343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.256906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase deficiency","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase_deficiency"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperimmunoglobulin_E_syndrome"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"}]}
