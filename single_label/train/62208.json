{"id":62208,"title":"Central nervous system lymphoma: patterns of incidence in Indian population and effect of steroids on stereotactic biopsy yield.","abstract":"Epidemiology of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) world-wide shows an increase in incidence linked to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic.This retrospective review of case records analyzed the trends of hospital-based incidence of PCNSL over two decades (1991-2010), relation to immune status and effect of steroids on yield of stereotactic biopsy (STB).A total of 76 cases of PCNSL were diagnosed over a period of two decades. Incidence of lymphomas amongst all biopsied lesions showed a gradual increase from 0.18% at the beginning of study period to 0.41% at the end of study period. Only 8.6% (3 of 35 tested) of the PCNSL patients were positive for HIV. The mean age of patients with HIV infection (31.3 ± 3.5 years) was significantly lower compared with those without HIV infection (44.7 ± 10.9 years) (P = 0.033). Diagnosis was obtained by open biopsy in 32 patients (42.1%) and STB in 44 patients (57.9%). Open biopsy yielded a histological confirmation of PCNSL in all cases. Among those who underwent STB, the incidence of negative biopsy with short duration of steroids (? 1 week) was 33.3% and increased to 57.1% with increasing duration of steroid treatment (>1 week).This study documented an increase in hospital based incidence of PCNSL in our institute, independent of HIV association. Steroid intake administration for more than a week prior to biopsy adversely affected the yield of STB in PCNSL.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608449","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.806856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma","weight":0.506715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_central_nervous_system_lymphoma"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.288404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
