{"id":30218,"title":"[Mitigated presentation of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome].","abstract":"In clinical practice it can be difficult to distinguish between catatonia and the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). A female patient with an intellectual disability was treated in hospital with the help of risperidon because of conduct disorders. A few months later readmission followed with an NMS, which was initially interpreted as catatonia because of its mitigated nature, and its appearance several days after the cessation of the antipsychotic medication. On the basis of this case description, we discuss the clinical picture of the nms and its overlap with catatonia.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535768","annotations":[{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome","weight":0.829134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.302724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Catatonia","weight":0.241348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catatonia"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.238717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.20076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Conduct disorder","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduct_disorder"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Intellectual","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"}]}
