{"id":62590,"title":"Selection of contraceptive therapy for patients with thrombophilia: a review of the evidence.","abstract":"Awareness of the contributions of thrombophilia to thrombosis-related morbidity and mortality has been growing in the last few decades. Thrombophilia is especially concerning in females seeking contraception because some types of hormonal contraception have been associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Clinicians face a growing need for awareness of evidence-based contraception selection for this population.PubMed literature searches were conducted to provide a review of the literature describing contraceptive use in patients with thrombophilia. This review also describes contraceptive selection and counseling for this population.Studies of combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use demonstrate a 2- to 50-fold increase in VTE in individuals with thrombophilia, depending on the type of thrombophilia and the reference group identified. Two small studies describing VTE incidence in progesterone-only contraceptive (POC) users with thrombophilia were identified but they did not provide conclusive information regarding VTE risk in this population.POC may be recommended for contraception in patients with most thrombophilias, but studies should be undertaken to further define the safety of POC use in this population.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552487","annotations":[{"name":"Hormonal contraception","weight":0.814023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_contraception"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Contraception","weight":0.651161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraception"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.509317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.45569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Triple expansion steam engine","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_expansion_steam_engine"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Point of contact","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_contact"}]}
