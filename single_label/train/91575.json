{"id":91575,"title":"Hippocampal dysfunction during the chronic phase following a single exposure to cranial irradiation.","abstract":"Ionizing radiation can significantly affect brain functioning in adults. The present study assessed depression-like behaviors in adult C57BL/6 mice using the tail suspension test (TST) at 30 and 90days following a single cranial exposure to ?-rays (0, 1, or 10Gy) to evaluate hippocampus-related behavioral dysfunction during the chronic phase following cranial irradiation. Additionally, hippocampal neurogenesis, inflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were analyzed. At 30 and 90days following irradiation with 10Gy, mice displayed significant depression-like behaviors. We observed a persistent decrease in the number of cells positive for doublecortin, an immunohistochemical marker for neurogenesis, in the hippocampus from 1 to 90days after irradiation with 10Gy. Changes in the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1?, tumor necrosis factor-?, IL-6, and interferon-?, were not correlated with the decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis or the appearance of depression-like behavior during the chronic phase following irradiation. However, at 30 and 90days after irradiation with 10Gy, the number of microglia was significantly decreased compared with age-matched sham-irradiated controls. The reduction in the chronic phase was consistent with the significant down-regulation in the mRNA expression of iNOS, COX-2, BDNF, and GDNF in the hippocampus. Therefore, hippocampal dysfunction during the chronic phase following cranial irradiation may be associated with decreases in the neurogenesis- and synaptic plasticity-related signals, concomitant with microglial reduction in the hippocampus.
