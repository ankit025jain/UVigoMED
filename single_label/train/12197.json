{"id":12197,"title":"Protective effects of sulphonated formononetin in a rat model of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury.","abstract":"Sodium formononetin-3'-sulphonate is a derivative of the plant isoflavone formononetin. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective and angiogenesis effects of sodium formononetin-3'-sulphonate in vivo and in vitro. Treatment with sodium formononetin-3'-sulphonate (3, 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg, intravenous injection) could protect the brain from ischemia and reperfusion injury by improving neurological function, suppressing cell apoptosis, and increasing expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Treatment with sodium formononetin-3'-sulphonate (10 and 20 Âµg/mL) significantly increased cell migration, tube formation, and vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Our results suggest that sodium formononetin-3'-sulphonate provides significant neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats, and improves cerebrovascular angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The protective mechanisms of sodium formononetin-3'-sulphonate may be attributed to the suppression of cell apoptosis and improved cerebrovascular angiogenesis by promoting vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24549929","annotations":[{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.899863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.882415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.76014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.748874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Isoflavones","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflavones"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.694102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.678359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.621298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Brain ischemia","weight":0.594396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_ischemia"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.526654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Middle cerebral artery","weight":0.261989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
