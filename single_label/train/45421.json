{"id":45421,"title":"[Effect of electroacupuncture intervention on enteric microecology in ulcerative colitis rats].","abstract":"To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on enteric microbial populations in ulcerative colitis (UC) model rats, so as to study its mechanisms underlying improving UC.Thirty-nine male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, model group and EA group (n = 13 in each group). The UC model was established by intragstric perfusion of 4% dextran sodiumaqueous solution (DSS), once daily for 7 days. EA (15-25 Hz, 0.1 mA) was applied to bilateral \"Tianshu\" (ST 25), \"Zusanli\" (ST 36) and \"Shangjuxu\" (ST 37) for 10 min, once daily for 5 days. Disease Activity Index (DAI) including body weight and stool blood state was used to evaluate the animals' conditions. The rats' excrement was collected to detect the abundance and diversity of bacterial populations by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE).In comparison with the control group, the animals' DAI score and enteric Clostridium bifermentans content were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the abundance and diversity of bacterial populations, and contents of enteric Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Lactobacillus sp. were considerably down-regulated in the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the DAI score and enteric Clostridium bifermentans content were significantly lowered, and the abundance and diversity of bacterial populations, and contents of enteric Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Lactobacillus sp. were notably increased in the EA group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).EA can improve DAI and the abundance and diversity of enteric bacterial microbiota in UC rats, which may be related to its protective effect on enteric microecology in UC.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System
