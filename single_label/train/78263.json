{"id":78263,"title":"Accommodations quality for students who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing.","abstract":"Students who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing often receive accommodations that are intended to increase access to the educational environment. The authors provide the results of a large national study of accommodations use in secondary and postsecondary settings. The article focuses on three aspects of accommodations use: access, quality, and consistency. The participants were 1,350 professionals working with a diverse group of students who were d/Deaf or hard of hearing in a variety of roles, including educators, administrators, interpreters, vocational rehabilitation agency staff, and allied service providers. Data were collected from both a national survey and a series of focus groups conducted over a 1-year period. The authors discuss the results in light of the crucial nature of accommodations during the transition into a variety of educational, training, and employment options.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724308","annotations":[{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Special education","weight":0.62712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.622042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Teacher","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.329879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Vocation","weight":0.212894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocation"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.126897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0994886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.053154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Government agency","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency"},{"name":"Academic administration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_administration"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Allies of World War II","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Internet service provider","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Vocational rehabilitation","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Transition economy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_economy"}]}
