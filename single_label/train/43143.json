{"id":43143,"title":"Early identification and linkage to care of persons with chronic hepatitis B virus infection--three U.S. sites, 2012-2014.","abstract":"In the United States, an estimated 0.8-1.4 million persons are living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Among these persons, as many as 70% were born in countries of Asia, Africa, or other regions where HBV is moderately or highly endemic (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] prevalence ?2%). HBV-associated cirrhosis and liver cancer are major health problems for these populations. Most persons with HBV were infected at birth or during early childhood and are asymptomatic until advanced liver disease develops. To address these concerns, CDC recommends HBsAg testing for all persons born in these areas and linkage to medical care and preventive services for those who are infected. In 2012, CDC awarded funds to nine sites to implement this recommendation. This report describes programs at three sites (New York, New York; Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota; and San Diego, California) that conducted HBV testing, in clinical or community settings, and referred for medical evaluation and care those persons whose HBsAg test results were positive. During October 2012-March 2014, the three sites tested 4,727 persons for HBV infection; 310 (6.6%) were HBsAg-positive. Among the HBsAg-positive persons, 94% were informed of their results, 90% were counseled, 86% were referred for care, and 66% attended their scheduled first medical visit. These projects demonstrate that community-based programs can identify infected persons among populations with a high prevalence of HBV infection and refer HBsAg-positive persons for care. Individualized efforts to assist patients with accessing and receiving health-care services (\"patient navigation services\") can increase the number of persons who follow up on referrals and receive recommended care.
