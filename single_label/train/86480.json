{"id":86480,"title":"Obstructive sleep apnoea and atopy among middle aged chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial asthma patients.","abstract":"Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is associated with significant morbidity. A high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) symptoms has been reported in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are limited studies regarding relationship between atopy and OSA.To study the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea among middle aged chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma patients by a home based sleep study and its association with atopy.Patients with asthma and COPD were evaluated for OSA symptoms by Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and Berlin questionnaire (BQ). ESS score > or = 9 was considered as high risk for OSA. Patients having high risk for OSA by ESS and BQ were further evaluated for OSA by home based sleep study. Skin prick test against common allergens was done to diagnose atopy in these patients.Among 400 patients (229, 57.25% male and 171, 42.75% female) 328 were asthmatics and 72 were COPD patients. ESS and BQ was positive in 11.25% (45/400) and 18.25% (73/400) patients respectively. ESS was positive in 10.67% (35/328) of asthma and 13.88% (10/72) of COPD patients. BQ was positive in 18.29% (60/328) of asthmatic and 18.05% (13/72) of COPD patients. Skin prick test was positive in 74.16% patients. The maximum positivity was found in asthmatics (139/155, 89.68%) compared to COPD patients (16/155, 10.32%). Skin prick test was done for 40 patients out of 73 of Asthma and COPD patients who were found positive by ESS and BQ. 72.5% patients were found to be atopic. Out of 19 patients in whom home polysomnography was done, 13 patients consented for skin prick test with common aeroallergens and 9 (69.23%) patients were found to be atopic.There is an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnoea among middle aged chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma patients. Atopy could be associated with OSA. The association needs to be proved in a larger study.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772697","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.889572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.869543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.787188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.776875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.775896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.663118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.654783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Berlin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"},{"name":"Epworth Sleepiness Scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epworth_Sleepiness_Scale"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"}]}
