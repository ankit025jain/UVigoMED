{"id":82624,"title":"The additional information of bitewing radiographs in the detection of established or severe dentinal decay in 14-year olds: a cross-sectional study in low-caries population.","abstract":"To reveal the additional value of radiographic bitewings (BW) in detection of caries and in comparing the occurrence of clinically undetected severe decay between 14-year olds with and without clinically observed dentinal caries in a low-caries prevalence population.The cross-sectional study used 363 pairs of radiographs read by one examiner without knowledge of the clinical findings. The yield was analyzed on a tooth surface level by cross tabulating the clinical and radiographic information and on an individual level by counting the number of yield surfaces for all subjects. Mann-Whitney U test was used.On a tooth surface level, the contribution of BW was the greatest on the occlusal surfaces of the first molars, where established or severe dentinal decay was registered in BW in 11% of clinically sound surfaces and in 40% of established cavitated enamel lesions. On an individual level, 53% of subjects benefited from BW. The subjects clinically DMFS > 0 benefited more than the clinically DMFS = 0 subjects (P = .004), nearly 60% in relation to 47%, respectively.In a low-caries prevalence population a remarkable portion of both clinically DMFS = 0 and DMFS > 0 14-year olds benefit from BW examination. Most of the benefit is obtained on the occlusal surfaces of the first and the second permanent molars.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574869","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.491498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.384619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.355874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.308668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.0571223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"363","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/363"},{"name":"Counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting"},{"name":"Table (information)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Biological warfare","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0137743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
