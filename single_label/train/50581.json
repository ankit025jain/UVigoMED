{"id":50581,"title":"[Experimental technology of chemoperfusion treatment for abdominal carcinomatosis in ovarian cancer].","abstract":"An experimental technology of normothermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion with cisplatin and dioxadet has been elaborated to treat abdominal carcinomatosis in ovarian cancer. Antitumor effects of the treatment were evaluated for the duration of animal life. Normothermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion with cisplatin and dioxadet in comparison with the standard intraperitoneal administration significantly increased the median life expectancy by 75-92%. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion with dioxadet demonstrated potentiation of antitumor effect of hyperthermia and dioxadet. Experimental technology is recommended for testing new drugs and methods of chemoperfusion for malignant tumors affecting the peritoneum.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772620","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.735353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.613726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Hyperthermia","weight":0.38036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_hyperthermic_chemoperfusion"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.319357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.264844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Carcinosis","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Fauna","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
