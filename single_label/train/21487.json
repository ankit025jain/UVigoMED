{"id":21487,"title":"All eotaxins CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26 are increased but to various extents in pulmonary tuberculosis patients.","abstract":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a pulmonary pathogen responsible for tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized histologically by granulomas at the site of disease activity. Primary pathologic feature of TB is formation of a granuloma, and chemokines are known to play an important role in the formation of granulomas during infection. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the serum levels of CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 in the TB patients in comparison to healthy controls.The population of this cross-sectional study included 300 patients suffering from TB and 100 healthy controls. Concentrations of CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. The results were analyzed using SPSS software package version 18. Differences were considered significant where p was less than 0.05.The results showed significant elevated serum levels of CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 in TB patients compared to controls.According to the present results it can be concluded that CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 (which are produced by Th2 cells and other cells which induce Th2 development) are increased in TB patients; hence, it seems that TB suppresses Th1 and the classic function of macrophages subsequently by inducing the chemokines' expression.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600981","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pulmonary tuberculosis","weight":0.271313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"CCL11","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL11"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"}]}
