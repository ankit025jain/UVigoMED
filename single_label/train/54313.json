{"id":54313,"title":"Diabetes in long-term care facilities.","abstract":"With the aging of the population and longer life expectancies, the prevalence of population with multiple chronic medical conditions has increased. Difficulty managing these conditions as people age (because of changes in physical, functional, or cognitive abilities and the complexity of many treatment regimens), has led to more individuals with multiple medical conditions admitted to the long-term care facilities. Older adults with diabetes residing in the long-term facilities represent the most vulnerable of this cohort. Studies that specifically target diabetes management in older population are lacking and those that target diabetes management in the long-term care facilities are even fewer. The lack of knowledge regarding the care of the elderly residing in long-term care with diabetes may lead to treatment failure and higher risk of hyperglycemia, as well as hypoglycemia. In aging populations, hypoglycemia has the potential for catastrophic consequences. To avoid this, the management of older population with diabetes and other medical comorbidities residing in long-term care facilities requires a more holistic approach compared with focusing on individual chronic disease goal achievement.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464338","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.687788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.601684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.449924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.376208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.33322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.278591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Holism","weight":0.225489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.143477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Holistic health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holistic_health"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Non-communicable disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-communicable_disease"}]}
