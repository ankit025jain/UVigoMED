{"id":51037,"title":"Overexpression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule protein is associated with favorable prognosis in an unselected cohort of ovarian cancer patients.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic influence of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in an unselected cohort of ovarian cancer (OC) patients.Expression of EpCAM was determined by immunohistochemistry in an unselected cohort of 117 patients with OC. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses adjusted for age, tumor stage, histological grading, histological subtype, postoperative tumor burden and completeness of chemotherapy were performed in order to determine the prognostic influence of EpCAM. The Kaplan-Meier method is used to estimate survival rates.Univariable Cox regression analysis showed that overexpression of EpCAM is associated with favorable prognosis in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.011) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (p = 0.003). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, overexpression of EpCAM retains its significance independent of established prognostic factors for longer PFS [hazard ratios (HR) 0.408, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.197-0.846, p = 0.003] but not for PFS (HR 0.666, 95 % CI 0.366-1.212, p = 0.183). Kaplan-Meier plots demonstrate an influence on 5-year PFS rates (0 vs. 27.6 %, p = 0.048) and DSS rates (11.8 vs. 54.0 %, p = 0.018).These findings support the hypothesis that the expression of EpCAM is associated with favorable prognosis in OC.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728493","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.811696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.807764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.788923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.772419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.766704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.74046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.719996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.665761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.532844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Epithelial cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"408","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/408"},{"name":"846","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/846"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Completeness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Plot (narrative)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"}]}
