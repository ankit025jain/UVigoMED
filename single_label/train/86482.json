{"id":86482,"title":"[Evaluation of the anti-neuraminidase antibodies in clinical trials of the live influenza vaccine of the A(H5N2) subtype].","abstract":"In the current study, we evaluated the neuraminidase-inhibition (NI) antibodies among volunteers during the phase I and phase II of the clinical trials of a monovalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) A/17/duck/ Potsdam/86/92(H5N2). The reassortant influenza virus RN2/57-human A(H7N2) containing neuraminidase (NA) from the A/Leningrad/134/17/57(H2N2) was used in NI test. It was shown that two doses of the monovalent LAIV A(H5N2) led to a statistically significant increase in the NI antibodies to vaccine strain NA. More than twofold increase in antibodies was obtained among 19.5-33.3% of vaccinated. The microneutralization test and NI assay results coincidence in the same pairs of sera of the vaccinated volunteers was 73.2%, suggesting thus a statistically significant interdependence between the values of increase in antibodies revealed in both tests (p = 0.04).","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772644","annotations":[{"name":"Influenza vaccine","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H2N2","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H2N2"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Live attenuated influenza vaccine","weight":0.805059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_attenuated_influenza_vaccine"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Neuraminidase","weight":0.748204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuraminidase"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.675816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H5N2","weight":0.527743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N2"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.480548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.229382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.194454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Attenuated vaccine","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine"},{"name":"Duck","weight":0.056755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Potsdam","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam"},{"name":"A17 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A17_road_(England)"},{"name":"Diploid","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Islamic calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar"},{"name":"257","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/257"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Westland Lynx","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Lynx"},{"name":"Peptide sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_sequence"},{"name":"Royal Navy","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Interdependence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdependence"},{"name":"Coincidence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
