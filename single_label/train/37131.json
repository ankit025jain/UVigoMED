{"id":37131,"title":"Preliminary study of the association of white-matter metabolite concentrations with disease severity in patients with Huntington's disease.","abstract":"Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to measure several metabolites in cortical gray and white matter in patients with Huntington's disease. The preliminary results show that CAG-repeat length correlates with white-matter N-acetylaspartate concentrations, and disease severity correlates with several metabolites.
