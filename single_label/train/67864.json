{"id":67864,"title":"From radiobiology to technology: what is changing in radiotherapy for prostate cancer.","abstract":"In the last decades, new technologies have been introduced in the daily clinical practice of the radiation oncologist: 3D-Conformal radiotherapy (RT) became almost universally available, thereafter, intensity modulated RT (IMRT) gained large diffusion, due to its potential impact in improving the clinical outcomes, and more recently, helical and volumetric arc IMRT with image-guided RT are becoming more and more diffused and used for prostate cancer patients. The conventional dose-fractionation results to be the best compromise between the efficacy and the safety of the treatment, but combining new techniques, modern RT allows to overcame one of the major limits of the 'older' RT: the impossibility of delivering higher total doses and/or high dose/fraction. The evidences regarding radiobiology, clinical and technological evolution of RT in prostate cancer have been reported and discussed.
