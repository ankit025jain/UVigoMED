{"id":3040,"title":"Ectopic pregnancy rates and racial disparities in the Medicaid population, 2004-2008.","abstract":"To assess 2004-2008 ectopic pregnancy rates among Medicaid recipients in 14 states and 2000-2008 time trends in three states and to identify differences in rate by race/ethnicity.Secondary analysis of Medicaid administrative claims data.Not applicable.Women ages 15-44 enrolled in Medicaid in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, or Texas in 2004-2008 (n = 19,135,106) and in California, Illinois, and New York in 2000-2003.None.Number of ectopic pregnancies divided by the number of total pregnancies (spontaneous abortions, induced abortions, ectopic pregnancies, and all births).The 2004-2008 Medicaid ectopic pregnancy rate for all 14 states combined was 1.40% of all reported pregnancies. Adjusted for age, the rate was 1.47%. Ectopic pregnancy incidence was 2.3 per 1,000 woman-years. In states for which longer term data were available (California, Illinois, and New York), the rate declined significantly in 2000-2008. In all 14 states, black women were more likely to experience an ectopic pregnancy compared with whites (relative risk, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-1.47).Ectopic pregnancy remains an important health risk for women enrolled in Medicaid. Black women are at consistently higher risk than whites.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25439806","annotations":[{"name":"Louisiana","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana"},{"name":"Indiana","weight":0.763007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana"},{"name":"Iowa","weight":0.763007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"},{"name":"Colorado","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Mississippi","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Arizona","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona"},{"name":"Medicaid","weight":0.747207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid"},{"name":"California","weight":0.671355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Texas","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas"},{"name":"Racism","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.59547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.583353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.583205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.358256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.343284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.254291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.225821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.205164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.121708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.117859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"York","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
