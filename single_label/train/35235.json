{"id":35235,"title":"Cervical spine malformation in cornelia de lange syndrome: a report of three patients.","abstract":"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a complex genetic disease with skeletal involvement mostly related to upper limb malformations. We report on three males with clinical and molecular diagnoses of CdLS. Besides typical CdLS features, all showed different cervical spine malformations. To the best of our knowledge, this is an unusual malformation in the CdLS phenotypic spectrum.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668777","annotations":[{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.641531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.624832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.596779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.350122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Cornelia de Lange Syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelia_de_Lange_Syndrome"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Greatest hits album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_hits_album"}]}
