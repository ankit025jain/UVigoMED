{"id":66598,"title":"[Molecular multimodal hybrid imaging in prostate and bladder cancer].","abstract":"Since the introduction of combined radiologic-nuclear imaging procedures like PET/CT and PET/MRI, new and promising diagnostic tools in bladder and prostate cancer imaging are available to physicians. Although PET-based hybrid imaging in bladder cancer is currently utilized only in selected cases, an increase in PET imaging can be observed in prostate cancer due to the development of cancer-specific PET tracers. Especially novel ligands of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) exhibit great potential to effectively influence future staging of prostate cancer. However, before recommendations for implication in routine staging can be given, evaluation in the context of prospective multicenter clinical trials are mandatory.
