{"id":60789,"title":"Decreased platelet count in patients receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration: a single-center retrospective study.","abstract":"A decreased platelet count may occur and portend a worse outcome in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). We aim to investigate the incidence of decreased platelet count and related risk factors in patients receiving CRRT.In this retrospective study, we screened all patients receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) at Jinling Hospital between November 2008 and October 2012. The patients were included who received uninterrupted CVVH for more than 72 h and had records of blood test for 4 consecutive days after ruling out pre-existing conditions that may affect the platelet count. Platelet counts before and during CVVH, illness severity, CVVH settings, and outcomes were analyzed.The study included 125 patients. During the 3-day CVVH, 44.8% and 16% patients had a mild decline (20-49.9%) and severe decline (? 50%) in the platelet count,respectively; 37.6% and 16.0% patients had mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 50.1-100 × 109/L) and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count ? 50 × 10(9)/L), respectively. Patients with a severe decline in the platelet count had a significantly lower survival rate than patients without a severe decline in the platelet count (35.0% versus 59.0%, P=0.012), while patients with severe thrombocytopenia had a survival rate similar to those without severe thrombocytopenia (45.0% versus 57.1%, P=0.308). Female gender, older age, and longer course of the disease were independent risk factors for a severe decline in the platelet count.A decline in the platelet count and thrombocytopenia are quite common in patients receiving CVVH. The severity of the decline in the platelet count rather than the absolute count during CVVH may be associated with hospital mortality. Knowing the risk factors for a severe decline in the platelet count may allow physicians to prevent such an outcome.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824815","annotations":[{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Hemofiltration","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemofiltration"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.716257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.237942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.1385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0331975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"1100","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1100"},{"name":"308","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/308"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Omen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omen"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Knowing (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowing_(film)"},{"name":"Nanjing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}]}
