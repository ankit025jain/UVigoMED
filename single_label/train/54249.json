{"id":54249,"title":"Fibroblasts from type 1 diabetics exhibit enhanced Ca(2+) mobilization after TNF or fat exposure.","abstract":"The effects of cytokine and fatty acid treatment on signal transduction in dermal fibroblasts from type 1 diabetics and matched controls were compared. Chronic exposure to TNF, accentuated Ca(2+) mobilization in response to bradykinin (BK) in cells from both controls and diabetics; responses were three-fold greater in cells from diabetics than in controls. Similarly, with chronic exposure to IL-1?, BK-induced Ca(2+) mobilization was accentuated in cells from type 1 diabetics compared to the controls. Pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C prior to the addition of TNF completely abrogated the TNF-induced increment in peak bradykinin response. Ca(2+) transients induced by depleting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) with thapsigargin were also greater in TNF treated fibroblasts than in untreated cells, with greater increases in cells from diabetics. Exposing fibroblasts for 48 hours to 2 mM oleate also increased both the peak bradykinin response and the TNF-induced increment in peak response, which were significantly greater in diabetics than controls. These data indicate that cells from diabetic patients acquire elevated ER Ca(2+) stores in response to both cytokines and free fatty acids,and thus exhibit greater sensitivity to environmental inflammatory stimuli and elevated lipids.
