{"id":60507,"title":"Novel myelofibrosis treatment strategies: potential partners for combination therapies.","abstract":"Of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), myelofibrosis (MF) is associated with the greatest symptom burden and poorest prognosis and is characterized by constitutional symptoms, cytopenias, splenomegaly and bone marrow fibrosis. A hallmark of MF is dysregulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway that has led to the development of JAK inhibitors targeting this pathway. Calreticulin gene mutations have recently been identified in JAK2 mutation-negative patients with MF. Identification of JAK inhibitor resistance and broad contributions to MF disease pathogenesis from epigenetic deregulators, pathways that work in concert with JAK/STAT (that is, mammalian target of rapamycin/AKT/phosphoinositide 3-kinase, RAS/RAF/MEK, PIM kinase), fibrosis-promoting factors and the MF megakaryocyte, suggest that numerous options may be partnered with a JAK inhibitor. Therefore, we will discuss logical and potential partners for combination therapies for the treatment of patients with MF.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888274","annotations":[{"name":"Myelofibrosis","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelofibrosis"},{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Megakaryocyte","weight":0.872134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megakaryocyte"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.757208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.688796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Myeloproliferative disease","weight":0.548361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloproliferative_disease"},{"name":"Janus kinase 2","weight":0.39473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase_2"},{"name":"Cytopenia","weight":0.320403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopenia"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.280205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.210374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Janus kinase","weight":0.097553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase"},{"name":"Calreticulin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calreticulin"},{"name":"Transducer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer"},{"name":"Janus kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Janus","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Logic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic"}]}
