{"id":61852,"title":"An 8-week course of 45?mg of carbonyl iron daily reduces iron deficiency in female whole blood donors aged 18 to 45 years: results of a prospective randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"Blood donation is known to contribute to iron deficiency in regular blood donors. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of postdonation iron replacement to mitigate iron deficiency in blood donors.A total of 282 female whole blood donors aged 18 to 45 were prospectively randomized in a double-blinded placebo controlled trial to receive an 8-week postdonation course of carbonyl iron (45?mg daily) or placebo. The primary endpoint was prevalence of iron deficiency (ferritin < 15?ng/mL) at 12 weeks postdonation. Secondary endpoints were eligibility to donate based on capillary hemoglobin (Hb) and incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) complaints.Ferritin levels at Week 12 were significantly higher in donors receiving carbonyl iron (17.0?±?10.9?ng/mL) compared with those receiving placebo (10.6?±?8.4?ng/mL; p?<?0.001). The proportion of iron-deficient donors was significantly lower in the carbonyl iron group (51.9%) compared to the placebo (80.5%; p?<?0.001). The mean Hb level in the carbonyl iron group (134.6?±?8.7?g/L) was significantly higher than in the placebo arm (130.0?±?9.9?g/L; p?<?0.001), significantly improving eligibility to donate at Week 12. Significantly more donors receiving carbonyl iron had at least one GI side effect (p?<?0.001). Importantly, 86.7% of donors receiving carbonyl iron indicated that they would take iron on an ongoing basis.An 8-week postdonation course of 45?mg of carbonyl iron significantly reduced iron deficiency and was well tolerated in female whole blood donors. Postdonation iron replacement may have a role in a broader strategy to optimize donor iron status.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660763","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.907611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.790852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.760806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.589488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.559674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Carbonyl","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl"},{"name":"Carbonyl iron","weight":0.340579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl_iron"},{"name":"Whole blood","weight":0.283838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_blood"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.245853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Electron donor","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_donor"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"}]}
