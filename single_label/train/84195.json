{"id":84195,"title":"[Efficacy of sulpiride and itopride in the treatment of functional dyspepsia in women with emotional and eating disorders].","abstract":"Functional dyspepsia is often accompanied by emotional disturbances, especially in postmenopausal women. Impaired homeostasis of the dopaminergic system maybe one of the common pathogenetic factors. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of drugs which block dopamine D2 receptors on psychosomatic condition in postmenopausal women.The study was conducted in a group of 60 women, aged 53-61 years, with postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) that met the Rome Criteria III. The severity of dyspeptic symptoms was determined statistically using a 10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The emotional state was estimated with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), whereas the body mass index (BMI) was the indicator of the nutritional status. Sulpiride (2 x 50 mg) was administered to 30 women for 16 weeks and itopride (2 x 50 mg) to 30 others.After sulpiride and itopride treatment equal decrease of dyspeptic symptoms was observed, respectively from 9.08 to 4.76 pts and from 9.02 to 4.64 pts. Significant reduction in the level of anxiety (p < 0.001) and depression (p < 0.01) was obtained in both groups, slightly higher after sulpiride. However, no significant change in BMI was found.Sulpiride and itopride are effective in the treatment of dyspepsia in the form of postprandial distress syndrome. These drugs in the several-month treatment have no significant effect on body weight.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25154198","annotations":[{"name":"Beck Depression Inventory","weight":0.950355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_Depression_Inventory"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Dyspepsia","weight":0.912077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.861965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.82371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Psychosomatic medicine","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine"},{"name":"Eating disorder","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.779036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.688645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor D2","weight":0.669567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D2"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.668233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor","weight":0.665631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.464936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.268427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.266114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.135398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.111585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Sulpiride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulpiride"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
