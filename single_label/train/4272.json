{"id":4272,"title":"[Occupational hygiene topics in ferroalloys production].","abstract":"Hygienic evaluation covered work conditions of main occupations in ferroalloys production on a plant in Ural regions. The occupations are: ferroalloy furnace operator, ferroalloy furnace worker and crane operator. The findings proved that the workers are exposed to a complex of occupational hazards among which dust and unfavorable microclimate play major role. At the enterprise, occupational dust disease cases (silicosis from exposure to silicon-containing dust) are registered, with average development duration of 28.7 +/- 6.2 years.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282808","annotations":[{"name":"Employment","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Occupational hygiene","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_hygiene"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.312234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.285833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.196992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Microclimate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microclimate"},{"name":"Silicosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicosis"},{"name":"Ferroalloy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferroalloy"},{"name":"Crane (machine)","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine)"},{"name":"Furnace","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furnace"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"}]}
