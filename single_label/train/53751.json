{"id":53751,"title":"Technology for the manufacture of Diabetic Rosogolla.","abstract":"Diabetic Rosogolla was manufactured by using low-fat cow milk. Six different combinations viz. type of chhana and two different concentrations (40° and 50° Brix) of cooking medium. All of the experimental samples and control were analyzed for physico-chemical, textural, and sensory properties. A 40° Brix concentration of cooking medium was preferred to give a highly acceptable Diabetic Rosogolla. The average composition of Diabetic Rosogolla is moisture-52.20%, fat-4.46%, protein-12.78%, sorbitol-29.66%, and ash-0.89%. Similarly, the rheological properties were hardness-7.85 N, cohesiveness-0.54, springiness-6.06 mm, gumminess-3.8 N, chewiness-26.07 Nmm, fracture force-4.1 N, adhesiveness-0.0272 Nmm, and stiffness-2.17 N/mm. This protocol can be adopted at commercial level and be used to serve the customers who desire fewer calories but cannot resist having the sweets after their meal.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499065","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Sorbitol","weight":0.779694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbitol"},{"name":"Cooking","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.648241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Rheology","weight":0.38185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheology"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.370048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.16904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Brix","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix"},{"name":"Physical chemistry","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry"},{"name":"Moisture","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Confectionery","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery"},{"name":"Chhena","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhena"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Fraxinus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Belgian general election, 2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_general_election,_2007"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Texture (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_(music)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 40","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_40"},{"name":"Group cohesiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_cohesiveness"},{"name":"Uncial 0272","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0272"},{"name":"Diet food","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_food"}]}
