{"id":61565,"title":"[Palmoplantar neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis with general extension in a child in remission after acute lymphoblastic leukemia].","abstract":"Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) is a form of neutrophilic dermatitis characterized by tender erythematous and painful papules involving the trunk, extremities and face. The generalized form is associated with malignant hemopathies. The palmoplantar form occurs in children without any context of malignancy. Histology shows a neutrophilic infiltrate surrounding and infiltrating the eccrine glands associated with vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of the epithelial secretory portion.We report the case of a 4-year-old girl with palmoplantar HEN progressing to the generalized form while in remission from acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Progression of HEN from the palmoplantar form to the generalized form has never been published previously in the literature.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703643","annotations":[{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.920292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.807742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.742814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.561266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.553399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Eccrine sweat gland","weight":0.513821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccrine_sweat_gland"},{"name":"Vacuole","weight":0.490991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuole"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.376144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.355872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.324985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Hidradenitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidradenitis"},{"name":"Hen (manga)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hen_(manga)"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"National Endowment for the Humanities","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities"}]}
