{"id":76547,"title":"The Affordable Care Act permits greater financial rewards for weight loss: a good idea in principle, but many practical concerns remain.","abstract":"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) increased the maximum rewards that group health insurance plans (including employers who self-insure) may offer in their wellness programs, with the goal of incentivizing healthy behaviors such as weight loss among the obese and smoking cessation. In this essay, I describe the history and intention of such programs, and make the following three points: (1) In principle, incentivizing healthy behavior can reduce external costs and help people with time-inconsistent preferences stick to their resolutions; (2) there are problems with the design of this portion of the ACA that will limit its effectiveness in achieving these goals; and (3) financial rewards for healthy behaviors have a mixed record to date, and thus many practical design features need to be resolved to improve the effectiveness of such programs.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988654","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.644416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.408324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.316523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Externality","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality"},{"name":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.153777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Essay","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay"},{"name":"Workplace wellness","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_wellness"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Term limit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Resolution (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(law)"},{"name":"Wellness (alternative medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellness_(alternative_medicine)"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"}]}
