{"id":24234,"title":"Plasma antibody profiles in non-human primate tuberculosis.","abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) in non-human primates (NHPs) is highly contagious, requiring efficient identification of animals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculin skin test is usually used but lacks desirable sensitivity/specificity and efficiency.We aimed to develop an immunoassay for plasma antibodies against M. tuberculosis. A key challenge is that not all infected animals contain antibodies against the same M. tuberculosis antigen. Therefore, a multiplex panel of 28 antigens (Luminex(Â®) -Platform) was developed.Data revealed antibodies against eight antigens (Rv3875, Rv3875-Rv3874 fusion, Rv3874, Rv0934, Rv3881, Rv1886c, Rv2031, Rv3841) in experimentally infected (M. tuberculosis strains: Erdman and H37Rv) NHPs (rhesus and cynomolgus macaques). In a naturally acquired M. tuberculosis infection, rhesus macaques (n = 15) with lung TB pathology (n = 10) contained antibodies to five additional antigens (Rv0831, Rv2220, Rv0054, Rv1099, and Rv0129c).Results suggest that this user-friendly and easily implementable multiplex panel, containing 13 M. tuberculosis antigens, may provide a high-throughput alternative for NHP TB screening.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446897","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.864015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Primate","weight":0.843146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Rhesus macaque","weight":0.717534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.594375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.572261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Contagious disease","weight":0.329769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagious_disease"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.278263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.218581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Macaque","weight":0.200455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"List of bus routes in London","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_London"},{"name":"Crab-eating macaque","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab-eating_macaque"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Horsepower","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower"},{"name":"1886","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1886"},{"name":"1099","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1099"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Postcodes in Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_Australia"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Norwegian national road","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_national_road"}]}
