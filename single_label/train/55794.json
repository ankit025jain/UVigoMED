{"id":55794,"title":"Endothelial keratoplasty in children.","abstract":"Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty has superseded penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) in adults as the procedure of choice for treating endothelial dysfunction, but endothelial keratoplasty despite the multitude of advantages has undergone a much slower adoption in pediatric patients. This review focuses on the recent advances made in the field of pediatric endothelial keratoplasty and the associated surgical challenges.Pediatric endothelial keratoplasty does not require as many sutures as PKP, and the wound size is smaller and more stable. Endothelial keratoplasty grafts clear faster, possibly allowing for a more effective management of amblyopia. Visual outcomes appear to be comparable with PKP but with a lower complication rate.As corneal surgeons grow more and more familiar with the nuances of pediatric endothelial keratoplasty, our understanding of this procedure will become more complete. The limited data available suggest that endothelial keratoplasty is a suitable surgical alternative to PKP in children.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807065","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.700939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.343125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Amblyopia","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Stripper","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripper"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Polish State Railways","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_State_Railways"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
