{"id":84963,"title":"Resistant cyclic vomiting syndrome successfully responding to chlorpromazine.","abstract":"Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a disorder characterized by recurrent, stereotypic episodes of nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms, separated by intervals of comparative wellness. These episodes carry on for hours or days. The patient is healthy between the episodes and has no clinical finding. For the treatment of the CVS, antiemetic, antimigraine and sedative medications were used. However, in some cases CVS treatment is very difficult. We report about a young patient, who did not respond to many agents, but was succesfully treated with chlorpomazine.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25006660","annotations":[{"name":"Chlorpromazine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorpromazine"},{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.855188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Sedative","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative"},{"name":"Antiemetic","weight":0.79695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiemetic"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.581676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Cyclic vomiting syndrome","weight":0.236645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_vomiting_syndrome"},{"name":"Stereotype","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype"},{"name":"Concurrent Versions System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System"},{"name":"Wellness (alternative medicine)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellness_(alternative_medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Cyclic compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_compound"}]}
