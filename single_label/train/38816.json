{"id":38816,"title":"A survey on readiness and needs regarding the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM.","abstract":"The New York State Congenital Malformations Registry (CMR) conducted a Web-based survey to assess reporting hospitals readiness and needs with regards to the transition from the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM for diagnoses and ICD-10-PCS for procedure coding system (PCS). The survey contains 8 questions focusing on the transition to collect information about case reporting methods, anticipated plan and date for the transition, and the needs from the CMR for the process. In September 2012, a link to the Web-based survey was sent to all 158 CMR reporting hospitals requesting completion of the online survey. By October 31, 2012, 91 (60 percent) out of 158 reporting hospitals completed the survey. For the question \"When will your facility be ready to report to the CMR using the ICD-10 coding system?\", a majority (71 percent) of the respondents answered October 1, 2014. With regard to the method they plan to use for converting from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS, 51 percent will rely on a crosswalk provided by vendors and 7 percent will use the general equivalence mapping method. Nearly half (45 percent) of the respondents were interested in implementing a dual reporting system (accepting both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM/ PCS by the CMR). For the question, \"What specific information would you like the Congenital Malformations Registry to provide in regards to reporting to this registry using ICD-10?\", 30% of the respondents requested a list of reportable ICD-10-CM/PCS codes and related descriptions, 10 percent requested an ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS crosswalk, and 19 percent requested keeping them updated with information about the transition and implementation of ICD-10-CM/PCS. Among the respondents who provided comments at the end of the survey, more than half (55 percent) stated that they are in the process of transition and 27 percent expressed thanks and appreciation for CMR's leading effort on the transition project. This online survey enabled the CMR staff to assess readiness and identify the needs of the hospitals regarding the transition. This information will help the CMR with appropriate planning for our own transition and enable us to meet the needs of hospital reporters","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400373","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.397256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.218005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.208501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Reporter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"October 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_1"},{"name":"October 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_31"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"York","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York"},{"name":"General Certificate of Secondary Education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Paid survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_survey"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"ICD-10","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"DSM-IV Codes","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-IV_Codes"},{"name":"Pedestrian crossing","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_crossing"}]}
