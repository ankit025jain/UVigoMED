{"id":46789,"title":"Clinical significance of polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase-5 (GalNAc-T5) expression in patients with gastric cancer.","abstract":"The family of polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases is responsible for the altered O-linked glycosylation occurring during the development of various cancers and their progression via altering O-glycan biosynthesis. Our studies were designed to investigate the expression and prognostic values of GalNAc-T5 and improve the risk stratification in patients with gastric cancer.Tissue samples from a training set and a validation set of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma from China were used for analyses. GalNAc-T5 expression was retrospectively analysed by immunohistochemistry. Results were assessed for association with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Prognostic values of GalNAc-T5 expression and clinical outcomes were evaluated by Cox regression analysis. A molecular prognostic stratification scheme incorporating GalNAc-T5 expression was determined by using receiver operating characteristic analysis.GalNAc-T5 expression was markedly reduced in gastric cancer tissues compared with non-malignant gastric mucosa. Low intratumoral GalNAc-T5 density, which was associated with tumour cell differentiation, T classification, N classification, and TNM stage in the two independent sets, was an independent prognosticator for poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Applying the prognostic value of intratumoral GalNAc-T5 density to the conventional clinicopathologic TNM stage system showed a better prognostic value in patients with gastric cancer.Intratumoral GalNAc-T5 expression was recognised as an independent prognostic marker for the overall survival of gastric cancer patients. Detection of GalNAc-T5 expression in gastric cancer tissues might add some prognostic information for patients with this disease and lead to a more accurate classification under the TNM stage system.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619076","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.819078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Transferase","weight":0.750615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferase"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.735901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.682669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.607123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.565246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.422191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"China","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.360136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.341701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Training set","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
