{"id":79830,"title":"Suspected new wave of muscular sarcocystosis in travellers returning from Tioman Island, Malaysia, May 2014.","abstract":"In May 2014, six patients presented in Germany with a Sarcocystis-associated febrile myositis syndrome after returning from Tioman Island, Malaysia. During two earlier waves of infections, in 2011 and 2012, about 100 travellers returning to various European countries from the island were affected. While the first two waves were associated with travel to Tioman Island mostly during the summer months, this current series of infections is associated with travel in early spring, possibly indicating an upcoming new epidemic.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24906376","annotations":[{"name":"Germany","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.517303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.179976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Island","weight":0.129368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.0425622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tioman Island","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tioman_Island"},{"name":"Myositis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myositis"},{"name":"Sarcocystis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcocystis"},{"name":"New Wave music","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_music"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Spring (hydrosphere)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)"},{"name":"2014 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup"}]}
