{"id":17953,"title":"Antibacterial use in the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Denmark 1999-2011.","abstract":"The Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Denmark are neighbouring Nordic countries with great ethnic, cultural, and political similarities and are relatively homogeneous. Important information about prescribing practices can be obtained by comparing the antibacterial use in these countries. The objective was to describe, compare, and analyse the use of systemic antibacterial agents in these countries during the y 1999-2011.Data were obtained from the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Denmark on systemic antibacterial use and expressed in defined daily dosages (DDD). Prescription data were also obtained for specific age groups.The total antibacterial use for the y 1999-2011 varied markedly between the 3 countries, with a mean use of 21.8 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day (DID) in Iceland, 17.7 in the Faroe Islands, and 16.3 in Denmark. The total use remained fairly constant over the years in the Faroe Islands and Iceland, whereas in Denmark it increased gradually from 13.5 DID in 1999 to 19.5 DID in 2011. The higher use in Iceland can be explained by much higher consumption of tetracyclines. There was also considerable variation in the use of individual penicillins and macrolides between the countries.Despite the great ethnic and cultural similarities of these 3 countries, we found marked differences in total antibacterial use and important differences in the use of individual antibacterials.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832850","annotations":[{"name":"Iceland","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.697567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.622971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.597453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.554556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.538188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Faroe Islands","weight":0.519853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroe_Islands"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.445403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Nordic countries","weight":0.233015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Wallonia","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallonia"},{"name":"Macrolide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"},{"name":"Tetracycline antibiotics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics"},{"name":"Antiseptic","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiseptic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"Dissociative identity disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
