{"id":89868,"title":"Verification of whiplash-associated disorders in forensic medical practice. Part II--Objectivization of injuries.","abstract":"In clinical practice, cervical spine distortion or whiplash-associated disorders (WADs) are diagnosed exclusively on the basis of subjective complaints presented by the patients and by information that they were involved in traffic collisions. Therefore, from the forensic point of view, it is essential to verify all diagnosed WADs in the context of an extremely important and already proven mental component of the reported complaints and lack of objective changes in imaging examinations. The study presents suggestions regarding objectivization of acute episodes of cervical spine distortion in traffic accident victims based on medical criteria and accident circumstances. The knowledge of technical aspects of the circumstances of WADs facilitates medical evaluation of their consequences; moreover, the use of combined criteria allows for the assessment of probability of WADs in a particular traffic accident victim.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672894","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.39827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.371952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.352256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.293939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.290148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Medical jurisprudence","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_jurisprudence"},{"name":"Distortion","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.112367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0865741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Formal verification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Doom WAD","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_WAD"}]}
