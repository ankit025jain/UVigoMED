{"id":66269,"title":"GSPE is superior to NAC in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy: might this superiority be related to caspase 1 and calpain 1?","abstract":"Our study was intended to evaluate the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), caspases 1 and 3 and calpain 1 in the pathogenesis of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and to compare the protective effects of N acetyl cysteine (NAC) and grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) against the development of CIN.32 rats were divided into four groups; control, contrast media (CM), CM+NAC and CM+GSPE. CIN was induced by administration of 7 ml/kg diatrizoate. The experiment was discontinued on the ninth day. Blood was collected for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine measurement. Rat kidney tissues were removed for histopathological evaluation and the investigation of caspases 1 and 3, iNOS, eNOS, TUNEL and calpain 1.A significant increase in BUN, creatinine, renal histopathological injury, TUNEL, caspases 1, 3, calpain 1, iNOS and eNOS was observed in the CM group compared to the control group. There was amelioration in all these parameters in the CM+GSPE group, while there was no significant amelioration in BUN, creatinine and renal histopathological injury in the CM+NAC group. In addition, calpain 1 staining and creatinine were significantly lower in the CM+GSPE group compared to the CM+NAC group.Our study showed, for the first time in the literature, that GSPE has a greater renoprotective effect compared with NAC and that this effective protection may be related to decrease in calpain 1 levels.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727104","annotations":[{"name":"Blood urea nitrogen","weight":0.920421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_urea_nitrogen"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.829999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.78781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.683772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.655648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Calpain","weight":0.520754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calpain"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.458512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Grape","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.207246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Acetyl","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetyl"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Proanthocyanidin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proanthocyanidin"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
