{"id":50262,"title":"Discrepancy in term calculation from second trimester ultrasound scan versus last menstrual period in women with type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"To study differences in ultrasound-based compared to menstrual-based term estimation in women with type 1 diabetes.Nationwide register study.Norway.Deliveries in Norway 1999-2004 by women registered in the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry (n = 342) and the background population (n = 307 248), with data on both ultrasound-based and menstrual-based gestational age notified in the Birth Registry of Norway. Births with major malformations were excluded.Linkage of two nationwide registries, the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry.Estimated gestational age at delivery based on routine second trimester ultrasound measurements and last menstrual period.In women with type 1 diabetes, the distribution of gestational age at delivery was shifted considerably towards a lower gestational age when using second trimester ultrasound data for estimation, compared with last menstrual period data. The difference between the two estimation methods was larger among women with type 1 diabetes, although also evident in the general population. One in four women with diabetes and a certain last menstrual period date had their ultrasound-calculated term postponed 1 week or more, while one in 10 had it postponed 2 weeks or more. Corresponding numbers in the background population were one in five and one in 20.We found a systematic postponement of ultrasound-based compared with menstrual-based term estimation in women with type 1 diabetes. Relying solely on routine ultrasound-based term calculation for delivery decision may imply a risk of going beyond an optimal pregnancy length.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807126","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.746494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.730679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.692908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.562826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.254578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0639958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Second trimester","weight":0.0311489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_trimester"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"342","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/342"},{"name":"Site of Special Scientific Interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"Register (sociolinguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Calculation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Postponement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postponement"}]}
