{"id":90291,"title":"Hot asphalt burns: a review of injuries and management options.","abstract":"Hot asphalt burns to human tissue can increase the likelihood of infection and potential conversion of partial thickness to full-thickness injuries. Successful intervention for hot asphalt burns requires immediate and effective cooling of the asphalt on the tissue followed by subsequent gradual removal of the cooled asphalt. A review of the literature reveals that multiple substances have been used to remove asphalt, including topical antibiotics, petroleum jelly, a commercial product known as De-Solv-It (ORANGE-SOL, Chandler, AZ), sunflower oil, baby oil, liquid paraffin, butter, mayonnaise, and moist-exposed burn ointment (MEBO). Although many of these products may be effective in the removal of asphalt, they may not be readily available in an emergency department setting. Topical antibiotics are readily available, are more commonly described in the medical literature, and would be expected to be effective in the removal of asphalt. We developed guidelines for on scene (first-aid) management and the initial care of such patients upon presentation to a health care facility. These guidelines emphasize the principles of early cooling, gradual removal of adherent asphalt using topical antibiotics, and avoidance of the use of topical agents, which are likely to result in tissue toxicity.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630605","annotations":[{"name":"Petroleum jelly","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_jelly"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.642546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.59547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Butter","weight":0.585576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Mineral oil","weight":0.561192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_oil"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.547624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Petroleum","weight":0.529538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mayonnaise","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayonnaise"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.351701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.334694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Sunflower","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.228691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.170686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Asphalt","weight":0.148912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Fruit preserves","weight":0.124485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Sunflower oil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_oil"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Arizona","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}]}
