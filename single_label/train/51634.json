{"id":51634,"title":"Anti-hyperglycemic and anti-oxidative activities of ginseng polysaccharides in STZ-induced diabetic mice.","abstract":"Neutral (WGPN) and acidic (WGPA) polysaccharides were fractionated from ginseng polysaccharide. WGPN and WGPA decreased fasting blood glucose by different manners of administration. Intra-gastric administration of WGPA showed a marked hypoglycemic effect, which may be related to its anti-oxidative activity. The results indicated that WGPA may have anti-diabetic potential.
