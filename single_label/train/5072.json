{"id":5072,"title":"Amifostine reduces radiation-induced complications in a murine model of expander-based breast reconstruction.","abstract":"Immediate expander-based breast reconstruction after mastectomy is a prevalent option for many women with breast cancer. When coupled with adjuvant radiation therapy, however, radiation-induced skin and soft-tissue injury diminish the success of this reconstructive technique. The authors hypothesize that prophylactic administration of the cytoprotectant amifostine will reduce soft-tissue complications from irradiation, aiding expander-based reconstruction.Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: operative expander placement (expander group) and operative sham (sham group). Expander specimens received a sublatissimus tissue expander with a 15-cc fill volume; shams underwent identical procedures without expanders. Experimental groups were further divided into control specimens receiving no further intervention, radiation therapy-only specimens receiving human-equivalent irradiation, and amifostine plus radiation therapy specimens receiving both amifostine and human-equivalent irradiation. After a 45-day recovery period, animals were evaluated grossly and with ImageJ analysis for skin and soft-tissue complications.None of the control, radiation therapy-alone, or amifostine plus radiation therapy sham specimens showed skin and soft-tissue complications. For expander animals, significantly fewer amifostine plus radiation therapy specimens [four of 13 (30 percent)] demonstrated skin and soft-tissue complications compared with radiation therapy-alone specimens [nine of 13 (69 percent); p = 0.041]. ImageJ evaluation of expander specimens demonstrated a significant increase in skin and soft-tissue necrosis for radiation therapy-alone specimens (12.94 percent) compared with animals receiving amifostine plus radiation therapy (6.96 percent) (p = 0.019).Amifostine pretreatment significantly reduced skin and soft-tissue complications. These findings demonstrate that amifostine prophylaxis provides protection against radiation-induced skin and soft-tissue injury in a murine model of expander-based breast reconstruction.","date":"2014-10-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25357049","annotations":[{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.86885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Breast reconstruction","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reconstruction"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tissue expansion","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_expansion"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.76252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.669155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.663323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.650195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.57761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.479277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.447806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.356341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.323648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Amifostine","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amifostine"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0950163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cytoprotection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoprotection"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Cubic centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_centimetre"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"}]}
