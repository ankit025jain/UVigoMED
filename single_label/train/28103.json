{"id":28103,"title":"[Sociodemographic and clinical profile of patients with dual diagnosis living in Warsaw district Mokotow in comparison with participants in other European countries--results of the international, multicentre research project ISADORA].","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to compare socio-demographic and clinical profile of the inpatients with dual diagnosis in Warsaw with the profile of inpatients treated in other European centres.50 patients consecutively admitted in Warsaw were included in the study; total number of patients recruited from 7 European centers was 352. Recruitment was conducted in general inpatient psychiatric departments and specialized dual diagnosis inpatient wards. Data was collected during single interview with the use of M.I.N.I and EuropAsi questionnaires.Both in Warsaw and overall study population males constituted almost 2/3 of the group. Patients in Warsaw were more frequently living with relatives or other close persons as well as remained in intimate relationships in comparison to patients from other study sites. Depression was the most common diagnosis in Warsaw and it was significantly more often found it this center than in Tampere. Moreover, patients in the Warsaw group were significantly less frequently diagnosed with cannabis use disorder and more frequently - with tranquillizers use disorder.The differences among sites regarding socio- demographic and clinical profiles of dual diagnosis patients were due to both socio-cultural factors (e.g. psychoactive substances accessibility) and the research methodology.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007532","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.756375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Psychoactive drug","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Sedative","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.436965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.428812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.169122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.130186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Warsaw","weight":0.128079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.115315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Intimate relationship","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_relationship"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sociocultural evolution","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocultural_evolution"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Dual diagnosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_diagnosis"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Legality of cannabis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis"},{"name":"Ward (country subdivision)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(country_subdivision)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Accessibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility"}]}
