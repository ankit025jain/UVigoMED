{"id":27997,"title":"Problem drinking's associations with social structure and mental health care: race/ethnicity differences.","abstract":"This research used a nationally representative sample of 12,756 respondents self-identified as White, Black, Hispanic, or Asian to examine problem drinking in relationship to social structure and mental healthcare factors. Associations between problem drinking and particular factors varied by racial/ethnic group. Results also indicated that Whites' problem-drinking rates were higher than those of Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians. Americans sometimes use alcohol to manage stress stemming from social disadvantage and inadequate material resources. Across racial/ethnic groups, drinking level was associated with the type and degree of such disadvantage. Additionally, the presence of a mental health problem was associated with problem drinking.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052882","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.726059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.708801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.521335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.4771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.458832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.444715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.317294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.220999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Social structure","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Stress management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_management"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
