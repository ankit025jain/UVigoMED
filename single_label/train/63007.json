{"id":63007,"title":"A distinct set of long non-coding RNAs in childhood MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia: biology and epigenetic target.","abstract":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently found to be pervasively transcribed in human genome and link to diverse human diseases. However, the expression patterns and regulatory roles of lncRNAs in hematopoietic malignancies have not been reported. Here, we carried out a genome-wide lncRNA expression study in MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MLL-r ALL) and established lncRNA/messenger RNA coexpression networks to gain insight into the biological roles of these dysregulated lncRNAs. We detected a number of lncRNAs that were differentially expressed in MLL-r ALL samples compared with MLL-r wild-type and identified unique lncRNA expression patterns between MLL-r subtypes with different translocations as well as between infant MLL-r ALL with other MLL-r ALL patients, suggesting that they might be served as novel biomarkers for the disease. Importantly, several lncRNAs that correspond with membrane protein genes, including a lysosome-associated membrane protein, were identified. No such link between the membrane proteins and MLL-r leukemia has been reported previously. Impressively, the functional analysis showed that several lncRNAs corresponded to the expression of MLL-fusion protein target genes, including HOXA9, MEIS1, etc., while some other associated with histone-related functions or membrane proteins. Further experiments characterize the effect of some lncRNAs on MLL-r leukemia apoptosis and proliferation as the function of the coexpressed HOXA gene cluster. Finally, a set of lncRNAs epigenetically regulated by H3K79 methylation were also discovered. These findings may provide novel insights into the mechanisms of lncRNAs involved in the initiation of MLL-r leukemia. This is the first study linking lncRNAs to leukemogenesis.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488769","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.884636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Human genome","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.784086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.743958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Hox gene","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hox_gene"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Membrane protein","weight":0.6682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.634561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.402515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.349941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.248919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Histone H3","weight":0.175318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_H3"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Gene cluster","weight":0.102205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_cluster"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Subtypes of HIV","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtypes_of_HIV"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
