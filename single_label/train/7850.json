{"id":7850,"title":"A comparison of the efficacy of surgical renal denervation and pharmacologic therapies in post-myocardial infarction heart failure.","abstract":"Although renal denervation (RD) has been shown to be effective in treating post- myocardial Infarction (MI) heart failure (HF) in animal models and clinical trials, its utility as a standalone treatment without traditional drug treatment for post-MI HF still needs to be investigated.Rats were randomly assigned into seven experimental groups: N group (control group with no MI and no RD, n = 10), MI group (MI, n = 20), RD group (renal denervation, n = 10), RD-3d+MI group (RD performed three days before MI, n = 15), ?-blocker-3d+MI group (Metoprolol treated three days before MI, n = 15), ACEI-3d+MI group (Perindopril treated three days before MI, n = 15), and ARB-3d+MI group (Losartan treated three days before MI, n = 15). Cardiac function, autonomic nervous system parameters, and neuroendocrine activities were evaluated 8 weeks post MI.Compared to ?-blockers, ACEIs, and ARBs, RD alone provided significantly better cardiac remodeling and function, enhanced water and sodium excretion, and improved autonomic modulation.In this post-MI HF animal model, surgical RD provides effective autonomic modulation, inhibition of the RAAS, improved cardiac remodeling, and preserved renal function, without affecting normal circulation and cardiopulmonary function in normal rats. Compared to ?-blocker, ACEI, and ARB single-drug therapies, RD alone is more efficacious. These results suggest that RD may be an effective treatment option for HF, especially in patients who have contraindications to drug therapy.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Animal
