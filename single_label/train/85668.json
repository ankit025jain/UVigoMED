A comparative study on the efficacy and safety of bisoprolol and sustained release metoprolol succinate in patients with arterial hypertension (AH), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was conducted. High antihypertensive efficacy and good tolerability of bisoprolol and metoprolol succinate sustained release was shown in hypertensive patients with CVD and COPD. Bisoprolol versus metoprolol succinate sustained release was more effective in reducing the number of PVCs in hypertensive patients with CVD and COPD. After 12 weeks of therapy of bisoprolol there was a trend to reduce the number of patients with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy by 16.6 % (from 83.3% at baseline vs 66.7% after 12 weeks of treatment, p < 0.1). Despite the fact that the identified changes in respiratory function (ERF) in both groups did not reach certainty bisoprolol versus metoprolol succinate sustained-release was a lesser extent influenced the performance of ERF and more - to reduce dyspnea to the evaluation scales Borg and mMRC (delta% = -7.1 in fixed vs delta% = -3.8 in control groups and delta% = -5.6 vs delta% = 0 respectively) in patients with AH, CVD and COPD.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881311","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Metoprolol","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metoprolol"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Left ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.697993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Bisoprolol","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisoprolol"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Time release technology","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_release_technology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.189465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
