{"id":36893,"title":"Successful hybrid method to occlude a narrowed persistent left superior vena cava after cardiac surgery.","abstract":"A 25-year old woman with complicated cyanotic heart disease and a large persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) with dysplasia of the innominate vein draining into the left atrium underwent cardiac surgery. Six months later, the narrowed PLSVC was successfully occluded using a muscular ventricular septal occluder (nitinol wire mesh). No complications occurred during or immediately following the catheterization. This case report is the first to describe the utilization of a hybrid method to occlude a narrowed PLSVC after cardiac surgery.
