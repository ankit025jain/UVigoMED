{"id":78761,"title":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis by compression from a tracheal diverticulum.","abstract":"Tracheal diverticulum is a rarely encountered entity, located usually on the right side of the trachea as an outpouching of the wall. Based on mainly histologic features, it can be classified in a congenital or an acquired form. It is usually an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient. When symptoms are present, they are mostly nonspecific such as chronic cough, dyspnea, or pulmonary infections. We describe a case of dysphonia due to right recurrent laryngeal nerve compression from a tracheal diverticulum. Computed tomography scanning and bronchoscopy revealed the lesion and surgical resection resolved the symptom.
