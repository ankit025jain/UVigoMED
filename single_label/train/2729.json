{"id":2729,"title":"[Stem cell therapy of the eye].","abstract":"The structure of the eye and the currently available methods of ophthalmic surgery enable the development work on stem cell transplantations and their clinical implementation. For example the frequency of occurrence of age-related macular degeneration will increase significantly with the ageing population. Stem cell transplantations are therefore expected to be of considerable significance in the future treatment of ocular diseases. Clearly the farthest advance has been achieved with treatments developed for diseases of the cornea and the retina. Cell transplantations based on local stem cell transplantations are already in clinical use in some corneal diseases, and transplantations of retinal pigment epithelial cells differentiated from stem cells are being used in clinical studies.","date":"2015-01-06","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558620","annotations":[{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.903768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.875692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Eye surgery","weight":0.725677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_surgery"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.4655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.394998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.373346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Stem cell treatments","weight":0.136708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_treatments"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
