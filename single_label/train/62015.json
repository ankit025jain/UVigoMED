{"id":62015,"title":"Lymph node hyperplasia: clonal chromosomal and genomic rearrangements. Report of two new cases and literature review.","abstract":"Cytogenetic analysis is not routinely performed on lymph node hyperplasia (LH). We describe clonal chromosomal rearrangements in two unrelated cases of LH. Lymph nodes of both patients showed typical morphologic features of benign follicular hyperplasia. Cytogenetic analysis revealed clonal chromosomal rearrangements in both cases. Patient 1 showed interstitial 14q and 6q mosaic deletions, whereas patient 2 showed a terminal 14q mosaic deletion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with IGH break-apart probes identified a partial deletion of IGH in both cases, but the loss of the LSI IGH in patient 2 and loss of the LSI IGHV in patient 1 were observed on the morphologically normal chromosome 14. In the latter case, the finding of two morphologically normal chromosomes 14 with the IGHV deletion in one of the chromosomes suggested that the first mutational event was the IGH deletion and the second event was the interstitial deletion of chromosome 14 with the IGH intact. Array comparative genomic hybridization performed on both biopsies confirmed the IGH deletion at mosaic, but not the chromosomal deletion. Patient 1 was re-biopsied after 9 months and a marginal zone lymphoma was diagnosed. The finding of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in LH highlighted the difficulties in interpretation of results and clinical follow-up.
