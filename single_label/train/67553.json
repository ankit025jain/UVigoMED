{"id":67553,"title":"[Emphysematous cystitis with air bubbles in the vena cava].","abstract":"A 76-year-old diabetic woman was referred to our hospital with an episode of high fever and sub-abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis revealed gas accumulation within the lumen and wall of the bladder and CT of the abdomen demonstrated bubbles in the inferior vena cava. She recovered by urinary drainage and antibiotic therapy. Urinary culture revealed Escherichia coli. CT after the therapy didn't demonstrate gas accumulation of the bladder and bubbles in the inferior vena cava. Emphysematous urinary tract infections (UTIs) have the high fatality rate, it seems to be a possibility that venous bubbles with emphysematous UTIs contribute to the high fatality rate such as air embolisms. It was suspected that bacterial injury of the bladder wall and high vesical pressure caused by urinary outlet obstruction such as neurogenic bladder lead gas translocation into the venous system. Six previous cases of emphysematous UTIs (three emphysematous cystitis cases and three emphysematous pyelonephritis cases) with venous bubbles have been reported to this day. Our case is seems to be the fourth case report that venous bubbles with emphysematous cystitis was demonstrated.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605583","annotations":[{"name":"Pyelonephritis","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyelonephritis"},{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.810453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cystitis","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystitis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Neurogenic bladder","weight":0.754165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenic_bladder"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.553078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.542461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.381224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.290911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.226925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.0553506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Case fatality rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
