{"id":46888,"title":"Prognostic implication of TSC1 and mTOR expression in gastric carcinoma.","abstract":"Gastric adenocarcinoma is the sixth most common and third most lethal cancer in the world. Except for HER2-targeted therapy, targeted agents against specific molecules participating in gastric carcinogenesis, including those in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) (mTOR) pathway have not been proved to be effective. However, some studies have suggested that dysfunction of TSC1 may augment mTOR inhibitor activity.We studied p-mTOR and TSC1 status by immunohistochemical analysis of gastric carcinoma samples using a tissue microarray method and expression values adopted from The Cancer Genome Atlas.High p-mTOR and low TSC1 expression status is associated with adverse clinicopathologic parameters. Patients with high p-mTOR levels showed poor survival. Patients with low TSC1 levels showed unfavorable survival status in the overall patients group. The combination of p-mTOR status and TSC1 status provided more strong survival information than using each parameter alone.In gastric cancer, high p-mTOR expression level is a statistically significant parameter in multivariate and Kaplan-Meier analyses (log-rank test). In addition to p-mTOR, TSC1 expression provided additional information to predict survival. We therefore suggest that evaluation of both p-mTOR and TSC1 status may be helpful in clinical trials related to mTOR inhibitors.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615476","annotations":[{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.826497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.766704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"The Cancer Genome Atlas","weight":0.600487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.552099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.410659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.2165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0724204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"}]}
