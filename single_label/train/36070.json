{"id":36070,"title":"Is age at initiation of extracorporeal life support associated with mortality and intraventricular hemorrhage in neonates with respiratory failure?","abstract":"To describe differences in characteristics among neonates treated with extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in the first week of life for respiratory failure compared with later in the neonatal period and to assess risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage and mortality among the two groups.Review of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry from 2001 to 2010 of neonates ?30 days comparing two age groups: those ?7 days (Group 1) to those >7 days (Group 2) at ECLS initiation.Among 4888 neonates, Group 1 (n=4453) had significantly lower mortality (17 vs 39%, P<0.001) but greater CNS hemorrhage (11 vs 7%, P=0.02) than Group 2 (n=453). Mortality and CNS hemorrhage improved significantly with increasing gestational age only for Group 1 patients. CNS hemorrhage occurred more frequently in Group 1 patients receiving venoarterial (VA) than with venovenous ECLS (15 vs 7%, P<0.001). In Group 1, lower birth weight and pre-ECLS pH and VA mode were independently associated with mortality. In Group 2, higher mean airway pressure was independently associated with mortality. Complications of ECLS therapy, including CNS hemorrhage and renal replacement therapy were independently associated with mortality for both groups.Neonates cannulated for ECLS after the first week of life had greater mortality despite lower CNS hemorrhage than neonates receiving ECLS earlier. Premature infants cannulated after 1 week had fewer CNS hemorrhages than premature infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation starting within the first week of life.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603452","annotations":[{"name":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation"},{"name":"Intraventricular hemorrhage","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraventricular_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.801236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.776737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.76877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.707909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.699312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.570335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Ventricular system","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.448814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.323513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Life support","weight":0.11916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Renal replacement therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"}]}
