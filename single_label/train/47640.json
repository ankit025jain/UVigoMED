{"id":47640,"title":"[Study on the etiology of acute hepatitis hospitalized patients in Beijing Ditan Hospital from 2002 to 2011].","abstract":"To explore the etiology of acute hepatitis hospitalized patients in Beijing Ditan Hospital from 2002 to 2011.We summed up the changes in the characteristics of the etiology of acute hepatitis of patients mentioned above, and preliminarily analyze the causes.From 2002 to 2011, 6235 patients with acute hepatitis were admitted to Ditan Hospital, aged between 12 and 78 years old, Of which 4309 were male and 1926 female. Acute viral hepatitis accounted for 70.44%-85.07%, while CMV, EBV, drug-induced liver injury accounted less than 5%, and acute hepatitis D and acute hepatitis C less than 1.10%. From year to year, the incidence and constitution of acute hepatitis changed significantly. The proportion of patients with acute hepatitis in total hospitalized patients was from 20. 38% to 2.05%. In 10 years, the percentage of acute hepatitis A decreased most obviously, about 99.11%, while 45.07% decline in incidence of acute hepatitis B and 62. 28% of acute hepatitis E. The constituent ratio of acute hepatitis also changed significantly. The proportion of acute hepatitis A declined from 31.31% in 2002, to less than 1% in 2011. The proportion of acute hepatitis B increased from 26.47% in 2002 to 45.88% in 2011, an increase of about 2 folds in 10 years. The proportion of acute hepatitis E increased from 26.73% in 2002 to 32.05% in 2010, a rise of 1.20 times in 10 years.The proportion of patients with acute hepatitis in total hospitalized patients decreased from 20. 38% in 2002 to 2. 05% in 2011 in Beijing Ditan Hospital. The constituent ratio of acute hepatitis changed, too.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579471","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hepatitis E","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_E"},{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hepatitis D","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_D"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.507745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cytomegalovirus","weight":0.495538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.47587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.438193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.408764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.287499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
