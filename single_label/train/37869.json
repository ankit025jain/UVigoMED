{"id":37869,"title":"Maternal vitamin D status and small-for-gestational-age offspring in women at high risk for preeclampsia.","abstract":"To examine the association between second-trimester maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and risk of small for gestational age (SGA) in singleton live births.We assayed serum samples at 12-26 weeks of gestation for 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a sample of participants in a multicenter clinical trial of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia in high-risk women (n=792). Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to assess the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of SGA (birth weight less than the 10 percentile for gestational age) after adjustment for confounders including maternal prepregnancy obesity, race, treatment allocation, and risk group.Thirteen percent of neonates were SGA at birth. Mean (standard deviation) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower in women who delivered SGA (57.9 [29.9] nmol/L) compared with non-SGA neonates (64.8 [29.3] nmol/L, P=.028). In adjusted models, 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 50-74 nmol/L and 75 nmol/L or greater compared with less than 30 nmol/L were associated with 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.99) and 54% (95% CI 0.24-0.87) reductions in risk of SGA, respectively. Race and maternal obesity each modified this association. White women with 25-hydroxyvitamin D 50 nmol/L or greater compared with less than 50 nmol/L had a 68% reduction in SGA risk (adjusted risk ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.17-0.63) and nonobese women with 25-hydroxyvitamin D 50 nmol/L or greater compared with less than 50 nmol/L had a 50% reduction in SGA risk (adjusted risk ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.31-0.82). There was no association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of SGA in black or obese mothers.Maternal vitamin D status in the second trimester is associated with risk of SGA among all women and in the subgroups of white and nonobese women.II.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463662","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.882119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.822937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.803577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.792231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.776186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Small for gestational age","weight":0.75796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_for_gestational_age"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.729353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.482941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.45343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.447689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.326003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.159055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Second trimester","weight":0.141988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_trimester"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.125893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Parental obesity","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_obesity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0602743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
