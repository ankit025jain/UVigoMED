{"id":79139,"title":"[Study of allergen skin prick tests on different region of forearm].","abstract":"To investigate the variation on different regions of the forearm when taking the allergen skin prick tests(SPTs).Forty-one patients with hyper-reactive nasal symptoms were included. SPTs were done on the proximal, telecentric, middle region of right forearm and telecentric region of left forearm with house dust mite and histamine. The average diameter of wheal and the reactive grade were calculated and analyzed.The diameters of the wheal on equal position of two forearms were similar (P > 0.05). The intension of SPTs reaction decreased from proximal to telecentric region of the same forearm (P < 0.05).The intension of SPTs reaction on different region of forearm are quite different, which should be noticed in clinical practice.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482864","annotations":[{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.820809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Mite","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"House dust mite","weight":0.532839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_dust_mite"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.2165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.209495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.144841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0934771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Intension","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intension"},{"name":"Telecentric lens","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecentric_lens"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Paraphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly"},{"name":"Good Clinical Practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Clinical_Practice"},{"name":"Average path length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_path_length"},{"name":"Nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nose"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
