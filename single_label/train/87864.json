{"id":87864,"title":"[Staple fixation for the treatment of hamate metacarpal joint injury].","abstract":"To investigate the effcacy of the staple fixation for the treatment of hamate metacarpal joint injury.From May 2009 to November 2012,16 patients with hamate metacarpal joint injury were treated with staple fixation including 10 males and 6 females with an average age of 33.6 years old ranging from 21 to 57 years. Among them, 11 cases were on the fourth or fifth metacarpal base dislocation without fractures, 5 cases were the fourth or fifth metacarpal base dislocation with avulsion fractures of the back of hamatum. Regular X-ray review was used to observe the fracture healing, joint replacement and position of staple fixation. The function of carpometacarpal joint and metacarpophalangeal joint were evaluated according to ASIA (TAM) system evaluation method.All incision were healed well with no infection. All patients were followed up from 16 to 24 months with an average of (10.0 +/- 2.7) months. No dislocation recurred, the position of internal fixator was good,no broken nail and screw withdrawal were occurred. Five patients with avulsion fracture of the back of hamatum achieved bone healing. The function of carpometacarpal joint and metacarpophalangeal was excellent in 10 cases,good in 5 cases, moderate in 1 case.The application of the staple for the treatment of hamatometacarpal joint injury has the advantages of simple operation, small trauma, reliable fixation, early postoperative function exercise and other advantages, which is the ideal operation mode for hamatometacarpal joint injury.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974418","annotations":[{"name":"Avulsion fracture","weight":0.893697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_fracture"},{"name":"Carpometacarpal joint","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpometacarpal_joint"},{"name":"Metacarpus","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpus"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.419374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.275698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Hamate bone","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamate_bone"},{"name":"Metacarpophalangeal joint","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpophalangeal_joint"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Mode (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)"},{"name":"Fifth metacarpal bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_metacarpal_bone"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"The Staple","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Staple"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
