{"id":90626,"title":"Ultrasound-guided intra-articular lidocaine block for reduction of anterior shoulder dislocation in the pediatric emergency department.","abstract":"We report a case of successful reduction of an anterior shoulder dislocation after ultrasound-guided intra-articular lidocaine (IAL) block with subsequent sonographic confirmation of reduction. Current literature suggests that IAL can provide similar levels of analgesia as intravenous sedation, and IAL block is associated with lower complication rates and shorter emergency department stays. However, these studies may be limited by uncertainty about the accuracy of landmark-based glenohumeral injections. The use of beside ultrasound may improve the effectiveness of IAL block for reduction of anterior shoulder dislocation and provide a mechanism for immediate postreduction evaluation of the placement of the humeral head.
