{"id":30555,"title":"Sigma (?) receptors as potential therapeutic targets to mitigate psychostimulant effects.","abstract":"Many psychostimulants, including cocaine and methamphetamine, interact with sigma (?) receptors at physiologically relevant concentrations. The potential therapeutic relevance of this interaction is underscored by the ability to selectively target ? receptors to mitigate many behavioral and physiological effects of psychostimulants in animal and cell-based model systems. This chapter begins with an overview of these enigmatic proteins. Provocative preclinical data showing that ? ligands modulate an array of cocaine and methamphetamine effects are summarized, along with emerging areas of research. Together, the literature suggests targeting of ? receptors as an innovative option for combating undesired actions of psychostimulants through both neuronal and glial mechanisms.
