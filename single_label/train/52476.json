{"id":52476,"title":"Association of blood glucose control and pancreatic reserve with diabetic retinopathy in the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT).","abstract":"The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that intensive glycaemic control (INT) and higher plasma C-peptide levels in patients with poorly controlled diabetes would be associated with better eye outcomes.The incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) was assessed by grading seven-field stereoscopic fundus photographs at baseline and 5 years later in 858 of 1,791 participants in the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT).After adjustment for all covariates, risk of progression (but not incidence) of DR increased by 30% for each 1% increase in baseline HbA1c (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.123, 1.503; p?=?0.0004). Neither assignment to INT nor age was independently associated with DR in the entire cohort. However, INT showed a biphasic interaction with age. The incidence of DR was decreased in INT participants ?55 years of age (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.24, 1.0) but increased in those ?70 years old (OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.0, 8.24) (p?=?0.0043). The incidence of DR was reduced by 67.2% with each 1 pmol/ml increment in baseline C-peptide (OR 0.328; 95% CI 0.155, 0.7; p?=?0.0037). Baseline C-peptide was also an independent inverse risk factor for the progression of DR, with a reduction of 47% with each 1 pmol/ml increase in C-peptide (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.305, 0.921; p?=?0.0244).Poor glucose control at baseline was associated with an increased risk of progression of DR. INT was associated with a decreased incidence of DR in younger patients but with an increased risk of DR in older patients. Higher C-peptide at baseline was associated with reduced incidence and progression of DR.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599110","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.82223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.751478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.693799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.670581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.597067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.147495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.142337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0635535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0362083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Stereoscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Photograph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"791","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/791"},{"name":"305","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/305"},{"name":"858","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/858"},{"name":"921","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/921"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"}]}
