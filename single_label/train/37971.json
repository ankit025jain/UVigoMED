{"id":37971,"title":"An individual with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and additional features expands the phenotype associated with mutations in KAT6B.","abstract":"Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in FOXL2. We identified an individual with BPES and additional phenotypic features who did not have a FOXL2 mutation. We used whole exome sequencing to identify a de novo mutation in KAT6B (lysine acetyltransferase 6B) in this individual. The mutation was a 2-bp insertion leading to a frameshift which resulted in a premature stop codon. The resulting truncated protein does not have the C-terminal serine/methionine transcription activation domain necessary for interaction with other transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. This mutation likely has a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect, similar to those observed in other genetic disorders resulting from KAT6B mutations, including Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson (SBBYSS) and genitopatellar syndrome (GTPTS). Thus, our subject's phenotype broadens the spectrum of clinical findings associated with mutations in KAT6B. Furthermore, our results suggest that individuals with BPES without a FOXL2 mutation should be tested for KAT6B mutations. The transcriptional and epigenetic regulation mediated by KAT6B appears crucial to early developmental processes, which when perturbed can lead to a wide spectrum of phenotypic outcomes.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458743","annotations":[{"name":"Insertion (genetics)","weight":0.899898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Stop codon","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_codon"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.831703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Translational frameshift","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_frameshift"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Nonsense mutation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_mutation"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.59248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.509264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.276266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.125796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"De novo","weight":0.0259029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
