{"id":83439,"title":"The location- and depth-dependent mechanical response of the human cornea under shear loading.","abstract":"To characterize the depth-dependent shear modulus of the central and peripheral human cornea along the superior-inferior and nasal-temporal directions with a high spatial resolution.Cylindrical explants from the central and peripheral corneas of 10 human donors were subjected to a 5% shear strain along the superior-inferior and nasal-temporal directions using a microscope-mounted mechanical testing device. Depth-dependent shear strain and shear modulus were computed through force measurements and displacement tracking.The shear modulus G of the human cornea varied continuously with depth, with a maximum occurring roughly 25% of the way from the anterior surface to the posterior surface. G also varied with direction in the superior region and (at some depths) was significantly higher for superior-inferior shear loading. In the anterior half of the cornea, the shear modulus along the nasal-temporal direction (GNT) did not vary with location; however, the superior region had significantly higher GNT in posterior cornea. In contrast, the shear modulus along the superior-inferior direction (GSI) was independent of location at all depths.This study demonstrates that the peak shear modulus of the human cornea occurs at a substantial distance within the corneal stroma. Depth-dependent differences between central and peripheral cornea possibly reflect the location-dependent mechanical environment of the cornea. Moreover, the cornea is not a transverse isotropic material, and must be characterized by more than a single shear modulus due to its dependence on loading direction. The material properties measured in this study are critical for developing accurate mechanical models to predict the vision-threatening morphological changes that can occur in the cornea.","date":"2014-12-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358729","annotations":[{"name":"Force","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Shear modulus","weight":0.790083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_modulus"},{"name":"Isotropy","weight":0.615287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.575536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Transverse isotropy","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_isotropy"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.379473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Shear strain","weight":0.334013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_strain"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.287046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.150996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Shear stress","weight":0.130893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress"},{"name":"Angular resolution","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Stroma of cornea","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_of_cornea"},{"name":"GNT","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNT"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Strain (materials science)","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(materials_science)"},{"name":"Transverse wave","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_wave"},{"name":"Young's modulus","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Optical resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution"},{"name":"Explant culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explant_culture"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"List of materials properties","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_materials_properties"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0117506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"}]}
