{"id":32274,"title":"Age at referral and mortality from critical congenital heart disease.","abstract":"Newborn pulse oximetry screening is recommended to promote early referral of neonates with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) and reduce mortality; however, the impact of late referral on mortality is not well defined. The purpose of this population-based study was to describe the association between timing of referral to a cardiac center and mortality in 2360 liveborn neonates with CCHD.Neonates with CCHD born before pulse oximetry screening (1996-2007) were selected from the Texas Birth Defects Registry and linked to state birth and death records. Age at referral was ascertained from date of first cardiac procedure at a cardiac center. Logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate factors associated with late referral and mortality; the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 3-month survival.Median age at referral was 1 day (25th-75th percentile: 0-6 days). Overall, 27.5% (649 of 2360) were referred after age 4 days and 7.5% (178 of 2360) had no record of referral. Neonatal mortality was 18.1% (277 of 1533) for those referred at 0 to 4 days of age, 9.0% (34 of 379) for those referred at 5 to 27 days of age, and 38.8% (69 of 178) for those with no referral. No improvement in age at referral was found across the 2 eras within 1996-2007.A significant proportion of neonates with CCHD experienced late or no referral to cardiac specialty centers, accounting for a significant number of the deaths. Future population-based studies are needed to determine the benefit of pulse oximetry screening on mortality and morbidity.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982105","annotations":[{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.726522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.687537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.664622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.379073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.359066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.292374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.244746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Texas","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas"},{"name":"Pulse oximetry","weight":0.193284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.134465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"649","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/649"},{"name":"379","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/379"},{"name":"1533","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1533"},{"name":"277","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/277"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Well-definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-definition"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"75th United States Congress","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_United_States_Congress"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
