{"id":88035,"title":"Do family physicians, emergency department physicians, and pediatricians give consistent sport-related concussion management advice?","abstract":"To identify differences and gaps in recommendations to patients for the management of sport-related concussion among FPs, emergency department physicians (EDPs), and pediatricians.A self-administered, multiple-choice survey was e-mailed to FPs, EDPs, and pediatricians. The survey had been assessed for content validity.Two community teaching hospitals in the greater Toronto area in Ontario.Two hundred seventy physicians, including FPs, EDPs, and pediatricians, were invited to participate.Identification of sources of concussion management information, usefulness of concussion diagnosis strategies, and whether physicians use common terminology when explaining cognitive rest strategies to patients after sport-related concussions.The response rate was 43.7%. Surveys were completed by 70 FPs, 23 EDPs, and 11 pediatricians. In total, 49% of FP, 52% of EDP, and 27% of pediatrician respondents reported no knowledge of any consensus statements on concussion in sport, and 54% of FPs, 86% of EDPs, and 78% of pediatricians never used the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, version 2. Only 49% of FPs, 57% of EDPs, and 36% of pediatricians always advised cognitive rest.This study identified large gaps in the knowledge of concussion guidelines and implementation of recommendations for treating patients with sport-related concussions. Although some physicians recommended physical and cognitive rest, a large proportion failed to consistently advise this strategy. Better knowledge transfer efforts should target all 3 groups of physicians.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925947","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.80625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Ontario","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.618321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Toronto","weight":0.594957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.540631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.456322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.410685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.349576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.315483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.212661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.172685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Greater Toronto Area","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Toronto_Area"},{"name":"Knowledge transfer","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_transfer"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Terminology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Management information system","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_system"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Consensus (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(medical)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Auto racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
