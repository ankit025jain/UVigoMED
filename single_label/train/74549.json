{"id":74549,"title":"Hierarchical bayesian modeling, estimation, and sampling for multigroup shape analysis.","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel method for the analysis of anatomical shapes present in biomedical image data. Motivated by the natural organization of population data into multiple groups, this paper presents a novel hierarchical generative statistical model on shapes. The proposed method represents shapes using pointsets and defines a joint distribution on the population's (i) shape variables and (ii) object-boundary data. The proposed method solves for optimal (i) point locations, (ii) correspondences, and (iii) model-parameter values as a single optimization problem. The optimization uses expectation maximization relying on a novel Markov-chain Monte-Carlo algorithm for sampling in Kendall shape space. Results on clinical brain images demonstrate advantages over the state of the art.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320776","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.521039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.32596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.307243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.255432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Expectation-maximization algorithm","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation-maximization_algorithm"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Expected value","weight":0.147371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.141581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0652231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Generative model","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model"},{"name":"Joint probability distribution","weight":0.0254508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Voxel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0164971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"}]}
