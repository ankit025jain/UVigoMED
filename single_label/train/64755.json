{"id":64755,"title":"[Clinical application of the disposable circumcision suture device in male circumcision].","abstract":"To investigate the safety and efficiency of the disposable circumcision suture device (DCSD) in the surgical treatment of phimosis and redundant prepuce.We randomly assigned 249 outpatients with phimosis or redundant prepuce to be treated with DCSD (n = 129) and by conventional circumcision (CC, n = 120), respectively. Then we compared the safety and efficiency of the two strategies.Comparisons between DCSD and CC showed that the operation time was (4.02 +/- 0.69) vs (30.8 +/- 4.05) min, blood loss was (1.07 +/- 1.29) vs (8.72 +/- 2.15) ml, intraoperative pain score was 0.81 +/- 0.81 vs 2.42 +/- 1.15, 24-hour postoperative pain score was 1.84 +/- 1.02 vs 4.99 +/- 1.36, postoperative complication rate was 13. 95% (18/129) vs 9.17% (11/120), wound healing time was (13.99 +/- 9.06) vs (17.48 +/- 3.49) d, satisfaction with the penile appearance was 98.4% (127/129) vs 95% (109/120), and treatment cost was (2215.62 +/- 17.67) vs (576.47 + 15.58) Y RMB. DCSD exhibited obvious superiority over CC for shorter operation time, less blood loss, milder intraoperative pain, sooner wound healing, and better penile appearance, but it also had a higher rate of postoperative complications (P > 0.05) and involved more treatment cost than the latter (P < 0.05).The disposable circumcision suture device affords ideal clinical effects and therefore deserves clinical popularization.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306810","annotations":[{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.826578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circumcision","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.411431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Phimosis","weight":0.301208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foreskin","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreskin"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Renminbi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"249","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/249"},{"name":"576","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576"},{"name":"23rd century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23rd_century_BC"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Redundant church","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_church"},{"name":"Disposable","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable"},{"name":"The Model Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Model_Home"}]}
