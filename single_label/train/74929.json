{"id":74929,"title":"Operative treatment of the knee contractures in cerebral palsy patients.","abstract":"Knee flexion is one of the main problems of the lower extremities in cerebral palsy patients. Many operative procedures are recommended for contractures of the knee in cerebral palsy patients. We performed simple operation and analyzed the results after operative treatment with nine years follow up.85 patients with spastic cerebral palsy were treated in period 2001-2010. 40 were ambulatory and 45 non ambulatory with ability to stand with support. All of them underwent same surgical procedure with distal hamstrings lengthening. Tenotomies were performed on m. semitendinosus, m. semimembranosus, m. gracillis and biceps femoris. Only m. semitendinosus was tenotomized completely, other muscles were tenotomized only on tendinous part. The patients had a plaster immobilization for five days after the surgery with the knee extended.All 85 patients had improvement of the popliteal angle pre and post operative respectively. Improvement in the crouch gait was noticed in the period of rehabilitation. We had no complication with the wound. Three of the patients had overcorrection and achieved recurvatum of the knees.We consider this procedure very simple with satisfying improvement of standing, walking and sitting abilities in children with spastic cerebral palsy.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195348","annotations":[{"name":"Biceps femoris muscle","weight":0.902221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Semimembranosus muscle","weight":0.902221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semimembranosus_muscle"},{"name":"Semitendinosus muscle","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitendinosus_muscle"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Biceps brachii muscle","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biceps_brachii_muscle"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.686882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Hamstring","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring"},{"name":"Cerebral palsy","weight":0.668902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Popliteal artery","weight":0.588565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_artery"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.536669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.4592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.439334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Spasticity","weight":0.419566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity"},{"name":"Spastic diplegia","weight":0.374528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic_diplegia"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.346629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Plaster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster"}]}
