{"id":68852,"title":"Role of CDH1 promoter polymorphism and DNA methylation in bladder carcinogenesis: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Increasing scientific evidences suggest that CDH1 gene promoter polymorphism and DNA methylation may contribute to the development and progression of bladder cancer, but many existing studies have yielded inconclusive results. This meta-analysis aims to assess the role of CDH1 gene promoter polymorphism and methylation in bladder carcinogenesis. An extensive literature search for relevant studies was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases from their inception through April 1, 2013. This meta-analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 software. The crude odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated. Fifteen studies were included in this meta-analysis with a total of 824 bladder cancer patients and 818 healthy controls being assessed. Our meta-analysis revealed that the A variant of CDH1 -160C/A polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Further analysis by pathological subtype indicated that patients with invasive carcinoma had a higher frequency of CDH1 -160A variant than those with superficial carcinoma. We analyzed the methylation frequency of CDH1 gene in 608 bladder cancer samples and 338 normal bladder samples. Our data strongly suggest that the CDH1 promoter methylation frequencies in bladder cancer tissues were greater than those in normal control tissues. In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicates that promoter polymorphism and methylation of CDH1 gene may be involved in the development and progression of bladder cancer. CDH1 gene promoter polymorphism and methylation might be promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of bladder cancer.
