{"id":55428,"title":"Increased macular choroidal blood flow velocity and decreased choroidal thickness with regression of punctate inner choroidopathy.","abstract":"Changes in choroidal circulation hemodynamics during the course of punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate changes in choroidal blood flow velocity by using laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) in patients with PIC.This PIC patient was initially treated with systemic corticosteroids for 4 months. LSFG measurements were taken 10 consecutive times before treatment and at 1, 3, 12, 20 and 23 months after the initiation of therapy. The mean blur rate (MBR), a quantitative index of relative blood flow velocity, was calculated using LSFG in three regions: Circles 1, 2 and 3 were set at the fovea, a lesion site, and an area of normal-appearing retina, respectively.The PIC lesions scarred after treatment along with improvements in visual function and outer retinal morphology. When the changing rate of macular flow over the 12-month follow-up period was compared with the MBR before treatment (100%), an increase of 16-37%, 24-49% and 15-18% was detected in Circles 1, 2 and 3, respectively. At the time of PIC recurrence after 20 months, the MBR decreased temporarily but subsequently increased after retreatment with systemic corticosteroids. This trend was accompanied by a decrease in choroidal thickness at the lesion site after retreatment.Macular choroidal blood flow velocity increased and choroidal thickness decreased concurrently with regression of PIC. The present findings suggest that inflammation-related impairments in choroidal circulation may relate to the pathogenesis of PIC, extending over a wider area in the posterior pole than the PIC lesions per se.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885365","annotations":[{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.747551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.524338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.523427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.444583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Fovea centralis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.270684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.129709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0726852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Posterior pole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_pole"},{"name":"Speckle pattern","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_pattern"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Stoichiometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry"},{"name":"1637","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1637"},{"name":"1518","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1518"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"International Telecommunication Union region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union_region"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Master boot record","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"PIC microcontroller","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontroller"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Focus (optics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Illegal per se","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_per_se"},{"name":"Flow velocity","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_velocity"}]}
