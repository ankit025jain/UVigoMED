{"id":13389,"title":"Diagnostic imaging and pacemaker implantation in a domestic goat with persistent left cranial vena cava.","abstract":"Difficulty was encountered with the insertion of a right atrial pacing lead via the left jugular vein during lead and pacemaker implantation in a clinically normal goat as part of an ongoing rapid atrial pacing - induced atrial fibrillation research project. Fluoroscopic visualization of an abnormal lead advancement path prompted angiographic assessment which revealed a persistent left cranial vena cava (PLCVC) and prominent coronary sinus communicating with the right atrium. Angiography facilitated successful advancement and securing of the pacing lead into the right side of the interatrial septum. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA) allowed further characterization of this rare venous anomaly. Even though PLCVC has been reported once in a goat, to the authors' knowledge this is the first report to include MRI/MRA characterization of PLCVC and prominent coronary sinus with successful cardiac pacemaker implantation using the PLCVC.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480717","annotations":[{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Interatrial septum","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interatrial_septum"},{"name":"Coronary sinus","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_sinus"},{"name":"Right atrium","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_atrium"},{"name":"Cardiac pacemaker","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_pacemaker"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Artificial pacemaker","weight":0.758691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_pacemaker"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.717522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.669465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Venae cavae","weight":0.3699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae"},{"name":"Fibrillation","weight":0.308549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrillation"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.147166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.122553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"}]}
