{"id":53240,"title":"Low bone mineral density is associated to poor glycemic control and increased OPG expression in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"To investigate early alterations on bone mineral density (BMD) and RANK, RANKL and OPG mRNA expression in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the relationship with glycemic control and bone biomarkers.This cross-sectional study included 75 children and adolescents with T1D and 100 individuals without diabetes (normoglycemic-NG) aged 6-20 years old. T1D individuals were considered to have good (T1DG) or poor (T1DP) glycemic control according to the values of HbA1c. Phosphorus, magnesium, total and ionized calcium, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase and tartaric-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) values were determined in blood samples. BMD was measured by DEXA. RANK, RANKL and OPG mRNA expression was measured in PBL by real-time PCR.Osteocalcin values were decreased in diabetic groups in comparison to NG group (p<0.05), and a negative correlation with both serum glucose (r=-0.265, p<0.01) and Hb1Ac (r=-0.252, p<0.01) in T1D group was found. BMD was lower in diabetic groups in comparison with NG group (p<0.05) and a negative correlation was observed between BMD and both serum glucose (r=-0.357, p<0.01) and HbA1c (r=-0.351, p<0.01) in T1D group. OPG mRNA expression was significantly increased in T1D and T1DP groups in comparison with NG group (p<0.05). In conclusion, children and adolescents with early onset T1D presented low bone mineral density associated to unsatisfactory glycemic control, increased OPG mRNA expression and low osteocalcin concentration.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529565","annotations":[{"name":"Alkaline
