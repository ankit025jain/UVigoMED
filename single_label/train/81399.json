{"id":81399,"title":"Options in virtual 3D, optical-impression-based planning of dental implants.","abstract":"If a 3D radiograph, which in today's dentistry often consists of a CBCT dataset, is available for computerized implant planning, the 3D planning should also consider functional prosthetic aspects. In a conventional workflow, the CBCT is done with a specially produced radiopaque prosthetic setup that makes the desired prosthetic situation visible during virtual implant planning. If an exclusively digital workflow is chosen, intraoral digital impressions are taken. On these digital models, the desired prosthetic suprastructures are designed. The entire datasets are virtually superimposed by a \"registration\" process on the corresponding structures (teeth) in the CBCTs. Thus, both the osseous and prosthetic structures are visible in one single 3D application and make it possible to consider surgical and prosthetic aspects. After having determined the implant positions on the computer screen, a drilling template is designed digitally. According to this design (CAD), a template is printed or milled in CAM process. This template is the first physically extant product in the entire workflow. The article discusses the options and limitations of this workflow.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098158","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.84497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.808451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.795373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Computer-aided design","weight":0.72699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.433324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Computer-aided manufacturing","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing"},{"name":"Radiodensity","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiodensity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.272123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.270028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.111523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Drilling","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drilling"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"CBCT (TV)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBCT_(TV)"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Workflow","weight":0.0169634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Impressionism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Image registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Milling machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milling_machine"},{"name":"Virtual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual"},{"name":"Superimposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superimposition"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Extant taxon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_taxon"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
