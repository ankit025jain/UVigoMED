{"id":24173,"title":"A 21-day-old boy with an annular eruption. Tinea faciei / Tinea capitis.","abstract":"A healthy 21-day-old black male was referred to pediatric dermatology for evaluation of a facial and scalp eruption that had been present for less than 1 week. The child's parents had applied a topical corticosteroid cream for several days without any improvement noted. The child was otherwise well and thriving. Review of systems was negative. Family history was unremarkable for autoimmune or infectious skin diseases. On physical examination the patient was alert, active, and vigorous. He had multiple 1 to 2.5-cm erythematous annular, scaly plaques with pustules on the periphery on his upper cheeks, forehead, and anterior scalp (Figures 1-2). No alopecia was noted. Occipital and neck lymph nodes were not palpable. A potassium hydroxide skin preparation was negative for fungal elements and a fungal culture was performed. Serum laboratory testing was also performed.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450317","annotations":[{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.80334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.797301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.728618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.622356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Family history (medicine)","weight":0.523648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.482604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Forehead","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehead"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.430481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tinea capitis","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea_capitis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Tinea","weight":0.318273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.27138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.25586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.17501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Potassium hydroxide","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Hydroxide","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
