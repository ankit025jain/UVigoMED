{"id":66926,"title":"Effect of Cydonia oblonga Mill. leaf extracts or captopril on blood pressure and related biomarkers in renal hypertensive rats.","abstract":"Cydonia oblonga Mill. (COM) is used in traditional Uyghur medicine to treat or prevent cardiovascular disease. In a previous study COM leaf extracts were found to be active in renal hypertensive rats (RHR). The present study tests the dose-dependence of the effect of ethanol leaf extracts on hypertension and on biomarkers associated with blood pressure control, such as angiotensin-II (AII), plasma renin activity (PRA), apelin-12 (A), endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide (NO), compared to captopril.Two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) Goldblatt model rats were divided randomly into six groups: sham, model, captopril 25 mg/kg, COM leaf extract 80, 160 and 320 mg/kg (n=10 each). Drugs were administered orally daily for eight weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured before treatment and every 2 weeks. Blood and kidney samples were collected after the last treatment to measure AII, PRA, A, ET and NO.RHR had increased blood pressure, AII, A, PRA, ET and decreased NO. Treatment with captopril reduced blood pressure, AII, A, PRA, and ET, though not quite to normal values. COM leaf extracts significantly and dose-dependently reduced blood pressure, AII, A, RA and ET, whereas NO was increased. The highest dose of COM had the same effects as captopril.The effects of COM extracts on blood pressure and biomarkers were dose-dependent and at the highest dose similar to those of captopril. This suggests an action of COM on the renin-angiotensin system, which could explain its antihypertensive effect.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661965","annotations":[{"name":"Captopril","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captopril"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.848098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Renin","weight":0.788913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Endothelin","weight":0.671356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.556261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.426731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.42537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.389795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Apelin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apelin"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Quince","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quince"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Progressive retinal atrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_retinal_atrophy"}]}
