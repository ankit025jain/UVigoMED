{"id":82188,"title":"The physiopathological role of IL-33: new highlights in bone biology and a proposed role in periodontal disease.","abstract":"Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a recently described member of the IL-1 family. IL-33 acts as an alarmin, chemoattractant, and nuclear factor. ST2, a member of the Toll-like receptor/IL-1R superfamily, the receptor of IL-33, triggers a plethora of downstream effectors and leads the activation of NFK-B, leading the expression of several genes. IL-33 and ST2 are expressed in the majority of cell types, and the IL-33/ST2 axis has a role in immune response, bone homeostasis, and osteoclastogenesis. Several studies show opposite roles of IL-33 in osteoclastogenesis and the implication in bone biology. Few works studied the role of IL-33 in periodontal disease, but we hypothesize a possible role of IL-33 in periodontal disease and bone loss.
