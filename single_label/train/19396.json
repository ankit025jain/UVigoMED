{"id":19396,"title":"[Throat disease in the periphery of Europe: the introduction of diphteria antitoxin in Romsdal county].","abstract":"Diphteria played a key role in establishing the bacteriological model for explaining infectious disease. This understanding of bacteriological factors spurred research that culminated in the development of diphteria antitoxin, the first effective therapeutic cure for an epidemiological disease. Prior to the introduction of antitoxin, isolation and disinfection were regarded as the key defences against diphteria. The opportunity to combine antitoxin therapy with existing methods for combatting the disease was a key factor for the rapid spread of the antitoxin. Diphteria antitoxin was first used in Romsdal county in 1895. Initially the serum had to be ordered from manufacturers abroad, which restricted its application in the district. Few available doctors and long transport routes were reasons that prevented the antitoxin from reaching its full potential. Industrial manufacturing methods were an obstacle to serum production in peripheral areas. In Norway, production of serum gradually got underway in Kristiania, which was one factor that caused mortality from diphteria to decline faster there than in other parts of the country. In this article we will elucidate the relationship between the centre and the periphery in the spread of medical advances by studying the implementation of diphteria antitoxin in Romsdal county.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721865","annotations":[{"name":"Diphtheria","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"History of medicine","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.730769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.661902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Antitoxin","weight":0.661831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitoxin"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.612708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.52159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Oslo","weight":0.432155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.336157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.322559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.0994293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"1895","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1895"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"}]}
