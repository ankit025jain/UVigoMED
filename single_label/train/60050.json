{"id":60050,"title":"[Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)].","abstract":"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of myeloid neoplasm characterized bone marrow failure and increased risk of transformation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, significant advances have been achieved in understanding the molecular pathogenesis and treatment of MDS. Based on these advances, lenalidomide and azacitidine have approved for the patients with chromosome 5q deletion and high-risk MDS, respectively. However, treatment options for MDS still remain limited, therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed in clinical setting. In this article, recent progress of development of novel molecular-targeting agents for MDS that may have the potential to improve clinical outcome of this refractory hematologic malignancy is reviewed.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016808","annotations":[{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Azacitidine","weight":0.8314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azacitidine"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.758691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.47558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.462384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.3769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.358512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chromosome 5 (human)","weight":0.0254508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_5_(human)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
