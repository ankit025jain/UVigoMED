{"id":90615,"title":"Retrieval study at 623 human mesh explants made of polypropylene--impact of mesh class and indication for mesh removal on tissue reaction.","abstract":"Textile meshes frequently are implanted in the abdominal wall to reinforce a hernia repair. However, revisions for mesh associated complications confirm that these devices are not completely free of risk. Explanted devices offer an opportunity to define the impact of mesh structure on tissue response. This retrieval study analyses the tissue reaction to 623 polypropylene mesh samples (170 class 1 with large pores, and 453 class 2 with small pores) explanted for pain, infection, or recurrence. Histopathological assessment included morphometry of inflammatory infiltrate (IF) and connective tissue (CT), and of collagen 1/3 ratio. Half of the meshes were removed after more than 23 month. Despite large inter-individual differences removal for infection showed more IF than for pain or recurrence with significant correlation of IF with CT. Class 1 meshes with large pores showed less IF, CT, fistula formation, calcification, and bridging than class 2 meshes with small pores. Meshes removed for recurrence showed a lowered collagen 1/3 ratio in 70%. Large pore class 1 meshes showed an improved tissue response and may be considered as favorable to prevent inflammatory side effects. The presence of lowered collagen 1/3 ratio in most of the samples with recurrences stresses the relevance of an intact healing process. Late manifestation of complications demands long-lasting follow-up.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and
