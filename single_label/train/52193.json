{"id":52193,"title":"Lipoprotein(a) concentrations, isoform size, and risk of type 2 diabetes: a Mendelian randomisation study.","abstract":"Low concentrations of lipoprotein(a) in plasma are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but whether this association is causal is unclear. Variations in the LPA gene affect lipoprotein(a) isoform size and concentrations in plasma. We therefore did a Mendelian randomisation study to investigate whether large isoform size, low concentrations in plasma, or both, are causally associated with type 2 diabetes.We assessed data for adults from the Danish general population enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen General Population Study, with and without type 2 diabetes. Eligible participants had data for lipoprotein(a) concentrations in plasma, LPA kringle IV type 2 (KIV-2) sums of repeats (affecting both isoform size and plasma concentrations), and carrier status for the LPA single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10455872 (mainly affecting concentrations in plasma).77,901 individuals had lipoprotein(a) data, of whom 28,567 (36·7%) had all three measurements. Low concentrations of lipoprotein(a) in plasma were associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, with adjusted odds ratios of 1·26 (1·09-1·45), 1·17 (1·01-1·36), 1·04 (0·90-1·21), and 1·05 (95% CI 0·90-1·22), respectively, for quintiles 1-4, compared with quintile 5 concentrations. High KIV-2 sums of repeats were associated with risk of type 2 diabetes (adjusted odds ratio 1·16, 95% CI 1·05-1·28) for KIV-2 quintile 5 versus quintiles 1-4 combined. Being a carrier of rs10455872 did not affect risk of type 2 diabetes. For a halving of lipoprotein(a) concentrations, the instrumental variable estimate of the causal odds ratio for type 2 diabetes was 1·15 (95% CI 1·05-1·27) for KIV-2 sum of repeats and 0·99 (0·95-1·03) for rs10455872 genotype.Low lipoprotein(a) concentrations alone seem not to be causally associated with type 2 diabetes, but a causal association for large lipoprotein(a) isoform size cannot be excluded.Danish Heart Foundation, Danish Council for Independent Research-Medical Sciences, IMK Almene Fund, and Johan and Lise Boserup's Fund.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622370","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.936098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.607454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.490704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Mendelian inheritance","weight":0.489086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.434851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.418221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.378737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.31207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.121708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Copenhagen","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.045485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Kringle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kringle"},{"name":"Instrumental variable","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0255241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Airline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline"},{"name":"Instrumental","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"901","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/901"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"National Heart Foundation of Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Heart_Foundation_of_Australia"},{"name":"Household income in the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States"},{"name":"Liga Portuguesa de Andebol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_Portuguesa_de_Andebol"},{"name":"Districts of Mongolia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Mongolia"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
