{"id":22534,"title":"Reverse sural flap with bifocal Ilizarov technique for tibial osteomyelitis with bone and soft tissue defects.","abstract":"Tibial osteomyelitis, in association with bone loss and a soft tissue defect, poses a significant reconstructive challenge, especially in high-risk patients. We describe a case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tibial osteomyelitis with intercalary bone loss successfully managed with bifocal Ilizarov compression osteogenesis at the bone resection site and proximal distraction osteogenesis, accompanied by a reverse sural fasciocutaneous flap performed with a delayed technique. When free tissue transfer is not a reconstructive option owing to medical comorbidities or patient refusal, the reverse sural flap combined with bifocal Ilizarov compression and distraction osteogenesis can provide a reconstructive option to achieve limb salvage for these challenging cases.
