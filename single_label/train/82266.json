{"id":82266,"title":"An unusually large spindle cell sarcoma of the tongue in a male child.","abstract":"Reports of spindle cell sarcoma in the tongue are very rare, and seldom in the child. We report a five-year-old male patient who presented with a massive lesion on the right side of the tongue. This was surgically excised and histologically diagnosed as a Spindle cell Sarcoma. Results of bone marrow aspiration further revealed that about 16% of his bone marrow was infiltrated with abnormal pleomorphic vacuolated cells with bluish cytoplasm, consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells. The child was treated with surgery and chemotherapy with good initial response, but then died after one year following a relapse.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669028","annotations":[{"name":"Rhabdomyosarcoma","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyosarcoma"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.810683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.363573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Spindle neuron","weight":0.306098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_neuron"},{"name":"Bone marrow examination","weight":0.295147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_examination"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.206299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Vacuole","weight":0.145927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuole"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"}]}
