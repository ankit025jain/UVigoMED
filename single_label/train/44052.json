{"id":44052,"title":"[The course of coronary heart disease concurrent with peptic ulcer disease: clinical and pathogenetic aspects].","abstract":"To make a comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency of eradication therapy in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) concurrent with peptic ulcer disease (PUD).The results of treatment were studied in 112 patients with CHD concurrent with PUD who were randomized into 3 groups: 1) adequate eradication therapy during treatment for CHD; 2) antisecretory therapy; 3) treatment for CHD only. The trend in the clinical symptoms of the diseases and the results of an exercise test were assessed.After eradication therapy, Group 1 patients displayed a reduction in the frequency of angina attacks by 62.6% and weekly nitroglycerin needs by 70.4% and an increase in exercise tolerance by 45.3%. In Group 2 patients on antisecretory therapy, the similar indicators changed by 30.7, 21.2, and 26.5%, respectively. Group 3 patients showed no significant change in the study indicators.The findings suggest that eradication therapy has a positive impact on the course of CHD, which manifests itself as an antianginal effect and hence a change in the clinical picture.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754066","annotations":[{"name":"Nitroglycerin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.817416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.676964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.655405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Antianginal","weight":0.422038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antianginal"},{"name":"Cardiac stress test","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_stress_test"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.119782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Exercise intolerance","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_intolerance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Cardiac marker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_marker"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Public utility district","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility_district"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
