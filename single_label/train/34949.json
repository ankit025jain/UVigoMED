{"id":34949,"title":"Anomalous vertebral and posterior communicating arteries as a risk factor in instrumentation of the posterior cervical spine.","abstract":"We investigated the incidence of anomalies in the vertebral arteries and Circle of Willis with three-dimensional CT angiography in 55 consecutive patients who had undergone an instrumented posterior fusion of the cervical spine. We recorded any peri-operative and post-operative complications. The frequency of congenital anomalies was 30.9%, abnormal vertebral artery blood flow was 58.2% and vertebral artery dominance 40%. The posterior communicating artery was occluded on one side in 41.8% of patients and bilaterally in 38.2%. Variations in the vertebral arteries and Circle of Willis were not significantly related to the presence or absence of posterior communicating arteries. Importantly, 18.2% of patients showed characteristic variations in the Circle of Willis with unilateral vertebral artery stenosis or a dominant vertebral artery, indicating that injury may cause lethal complications. One patient had post-operative cerebellar symptoms due to intra-operative injury of the vertebral artery, and one underwent a different surgical procedure because of insufficient collateral circulation. Pre-operative assessment of the vertebral arteries and Circle of Willis is essential if a posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation is to be carried out safely.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692624","annotations":[{"name":"Circle of Willis","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_Willis"},{"name":"Posterior communicating artery","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_communicating_artery"},{"name":"Vertebral artery","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_artery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.741139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.61666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.51342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.509087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.468107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.447239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.327701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0881594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Collateral circulation","weight":0.0589684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_circulation"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cervical lymph nodes","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Spinal fusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_fusion"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
