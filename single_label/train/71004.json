{"id":71004,"title":"Polo-like kinase 4 inhibition: a strategy for cancer therapy?","abstract":"In this issue of Cancer Cell, Mason and colleagues describe the development of a Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) inhibitor (CFI-400945), with promising activity against tumors formed in mice from patient-derived tumor tissue. A clinical trial has been initiated, but questions remain as to whether PLK4 is the only relevant therapeutic target.
