{"id":35550,"title":"Epidemiology of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","abstract":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is among the most common and serious sequelae of preterm birth. BPD affects at least one-quarter of infants born with birth weights less than 1500 g. The incidence of BPD increases with decreasing gestational age and birth weight. Additional important risk factors include intrauterine growth restriction, sepsis, and prolonged exposure to mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen. The diagnosis of BPD predicts multiple adverse outcomes including chronic respiratory impairment and neurodevelopmental delay. This review summarizes the diagnostic criteria, incidence, risk factors, and long-term outcomes of BPD.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639412","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Intrauterine growth restriction","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Oxygen therapy","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.757491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.696212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.650959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.621852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.288187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.258217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","weight":0.201208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchopulmonary_dysplasia"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.122449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
