{"id":4664,"title":"Body dysmorphic disorder and orthodontics--an overview for clinicians.","abstract":"Patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) often seek aesthetic medical treatment including orthodontics to correct their perceived physical defects. When the disorder pertains to the dentofacial region, it is important for orthodontists to be familiar with this condition.The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current knowledge on BDD and its relationship to orthodontics.PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases were searched for publications relating to BDD and orthodontics. Further articles were sourced from the reference lists of the articles identified through the search.The literature recommends that orthodontic patients suspected of having BDD should be referred to a psychiatrist for a definitive diagnosis and subsequent management. However, this may be difficult to implement in clinical practice. Management by a psychiatrist could include pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. There is still debate as to whether orthodontic treatment should be provided for these patients.As health care workers providing aesthetic treatment to patients, orthodontists should be aware of BDD and its implications. Risks include repeated requests for unnecessary treatment, dissatisfaction with the result and thus potential for litigation. BDD still remains a challenge to diagnose, and further research is needed to determine the appropriate management of orthodontic patients suffering from the disorder.","date":"2014-12-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549524","annotations":[{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Body dysmorphic disorder","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Psychiatrist","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.645747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.462795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.3065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Scopus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus"},{"name":"Scholar","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"}]}
