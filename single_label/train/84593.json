{"id":84593,"title":"Attitude and knowledge of healthcare workers in critical areas towards deceased organ donation in a public sector hospital in India.","abstract":"The attitude of healthcare workers towards organ donation can either facilitate or hinder the process of organ donation. We assessed the attitude of healthcare workers employed in intensive or emergency care units of our hospital towards organ donation, and the influence of various factors on willingness for self-organ donation after death.All doctors, paramedical workers, nursing staff and other staff members working in six distinct intensive or emergency care units in the hospital were requested to fill a completely anonymous, voluntary and self-administered questionnaire. Younger individuals, women and nurses constituted a majority of the study population.The questionnaire completion rate was 99%. About 55% of the study population were agreeable to donating organs after death and 27% were undecided. The factors that positively influenced their willingness to donate organs after death were favourable attitude of the spouse, religious beliefs supporting organ donation, knowledge of hospital's organ transplant programme, personal experience of the organ donation scenario, having ever donated blood or involvement in social activities, willingness to become an eye donor and willingness to become a living kidney donor.A largely favourable attitude towards organ donation was seen in our study population. However, the study reflects incomplete knowledge leading to confusion and thus, desire to know more among participants with respect to various aspects regarding organ donation. The factors identify that positively influence decisions regarding organ donation can be used as direct interventions.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073987","annotations":[{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.80691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"India","weight":0.803857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Paramedic","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.537067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.485448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.460948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Religion","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.240035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.112458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Public sector","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
