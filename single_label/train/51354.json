{"id":51354,"title":"[Diabetes mellitus--risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Potential therapeutic implications].","abstract":"The relationship between atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus type 2 is controversial, and various studies have demonstrated conflicting results. However, the majority of larger prospective studies published during recent years demonstrated a positive correlation. After multivariate adjustment diabetes increased the risk for atrial fibrillation at least two fold. This combination is associated with substantially increased risks of death and cardiovascular events (stroke and heart failure). Atrial fibrillation in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 identifies individuals who are likely to obtain greater benefits from glycemic control and anticoagulants as well as antihypertensive therapy.
