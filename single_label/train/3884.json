{"id":3884,"title":"Biocompatibility of core@shell particles: cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human osteosarcoma cells of colloidal silica spheres coated with crystalline or amorphous zirconia.","abstract":"The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of novel colloidal silica spheres coated with crystalline or amorphous zirconia (SiO2@ZrO2(cryst) or SiO2@ZrO2(am)) have been studied in a human osteosarcoma cell line (MG-63), after 24 h exposure. SiO2@ZrO2(cryst) and SiO2@ZrO2(am) had mean diameters of 782±19 and 891±34 nm, respectively. SiO2@ZrO2(cryst) exposure reduced cell viability, with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease of the GSH/GSSG ratio. The comet and micronucleus (MN) assays detected DNA damage at 5 and 25 ?g/mL, respectively. SiO2@ZrO2(am) induced genotoxic action only at 10 and 50 ?g/mL (comet and MN assays), along with a decrease of the GSH/GSSG ratio at 50 ?g/mL. Both particles were found inside the cells, forming vesicles; however, none of them entered the nucleus. Our findings show that crystallization of the shell of the amorphous ZrO2 increases both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity.","date":"2014-10-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25344169","annotations":[{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Crystallinity","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallinity"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Silicon dioxide","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide"},{"name":"Comet","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet"},{"name":"Amorphous solid","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_solid"},{"name":"Crystallization","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallization"},{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.710405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.638494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Zirconium dioxide","weight":0.58169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zirconium_dioxide"},{"name":"Vesicle (biology and chemistry)","weight":0.580563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.568532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Genotoxicity","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotoxicity"},{"name":"Exoskeleton","weight":0.42225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.372433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.347966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.331511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.275049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.0783422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Micronucleus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronucleus"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Newton (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)"},{"name":"Minas Gerais","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais"},{"name":"Silicon monoxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_monoxide"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Colloidal silica","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_silica"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"}]}
