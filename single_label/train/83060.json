{"id":83060,"title":"Changes in the mucus barrier during cisplatin-induced intestinal mucositis in rats.","abstract":"Gastrointestinal mucositis is a frequent complication of antineoplastic chemotherapy, but the effects of chemotherapy on mucosal defense mechanisms remain poorly understood. We studied the effects of cisplatin on mucin, one of the principal defense factors of the gastrointestinal mucosa, and evaluated the efficacy of two different types of H2-receptor antagonists against cisplatin-induced mucositis.Cisplatin (6 mg/kg) was administered intravenously to rats (day 0). The rats were sacrificed 1, 3, 7, and 11 days after treatment, and their stomach, jejunum, ileum, and colon were removed. Immunoreactivity of the mucosa was compared with the use of anti-mucin monoclonal antibody. To evaluate the efficacy of H2-receptor antagonists, either famotidine (3 mg/kg) or lafutidine (30 mg/kg) was given orally once daily on days 0, 1, and 2. Histological and biochemical findings were compared among the groups to assess effects on cisplatin-induced injury.Cisplatin significantly altered the immunoreactivity and content of mucin in the small intestinal mucosa, especially in the ileum. Lafutidine protected against cisplatin-induced mucosal injury and attenuated decreased mucin accumulation.Cisplatin appears to alter the mucus barrier function in the intestinal mucosa. Lafutidine might effectively prevent chemotherapy-induced mucositis by activating intestinal mucus cells.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455680","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.847128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Mucositis","weight":0.828216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Mucin","weight":0.7441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.580419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.506431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.469104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Famotidine","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famotidine"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Plant defense against herbivory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_defense_against_herbivory"},{"name":"Intestinal mucosa","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_mucosa"}]}
