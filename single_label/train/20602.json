{"id":20602,"title":"Cluster of Fusarium verticillioides bloodstream infections among immunocompetent patients in an internal medicine department after reconstruction works in Larissa, Central Greece.","abstract":"Fusarium spp. can cause disseminated infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Fusarium verticillioides is a human pathogen, and sporadic cases of fusariosis have been reported.To report a nosocomial cluster of F. verticillioides bloodstream infections among seven immunocompetent inpatients following reconstruction works.Identification was performed using macroscopic and microscopic morphology, and molecular assays (sequencing the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region and translation elongation factor-1? gene). Susceptibility testing was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Environmental surveillance specimens were taken and cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates.In total, 16 blood cultures obtained from the seven patients were positive for F. verticillioides. All surveillance cultures were negative.In order to prevent fungaemia, it is important to implement effective infection control measures, before, during and after demolition and construction activities in healthcare settings.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
