{"id":89990,"title":"Relationship between CTX-II and patient characteristics, patient-reported outcome, muscle strength, and rehabilitation in patients with a focal cartilage lesion of the knee: a prospective exploratory cohort study of 48 patients.","abstract":"C-telopeptide fragments of type II collagen (CTX-II) are created during articular cartilage breakdown and CTX-II is considered useful as a biomarker of osteoarthritis. The primary objective of the present study was to explore the relationship between urinary CTX-II concentration and patient characteristics, patient-reported outcome, muscle strength, and rehabilitation in patients with isolated focal knee cartilage lesions. Furthermore, the secondary objective was to examine differences in urinary CTX-II concentration between patients with focal cartilage lesions and healthy controls.48 patients (mean age 33.4 years, standard deviation 9.0) with a focal full-thickness (International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3 or 4) cartilage lesion on the medial or lateral femoral condyle were included. After baseline assessments, the patients completed a 3-month rehabilitation program and 44 patients attended the 3 month follow-up. Baseline and follow-up assessments consisted of urinary CTX-II, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength measurements. CTX-II was also analysed in urine samples from 6 healthy individuals, serving as normal controls. Correlations were classified as very weak (correlation coefficient [r] < 0.20), weak (r = 0.20 - 0.39), moderate (r = 0.40 - 0.59), strong (r = 0.60 - 0.79), and very strong (r > 0.80).Except for age and quadriceps strength, no significant correlations were found between CTX-II concentrations and baseline characteristics, KOOS, or muscle strength. Except for age, all correlations were considered as weak or very weak. The patients with a focal cartilage lesion had significantly higher mean CTX-II concentration than the healthy control individuals both at baseline (p = 0.001) and at follow-up (p = 0.001). The mean CTX-II concentration tended to decrease during rehabilitation, but the reduction was not significant (p = 0.076).The current exploratory study demonstrated that patients with a focal cartilage lesion of the knee had higher concentrations of urinary CTX-II than healthy individuals. In addition, CTX-II concentration tended to decrease during rehabilitation.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661577","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.723856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.663039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.643255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Quadriceps femoris muscle","weight":0.616552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Hamstring","weight":0.60889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.342407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Weight training","weight":0.307444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0992137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.0665551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Type-II collagen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-II_collagen"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Paraphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Femoral condyle","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_condyle"}]}
