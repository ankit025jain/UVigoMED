{"id":45418,"title":"Divide and conquer: subproteomic approaches toward gastric cancer biomarker and drug target discovery.","abstract":"The discovery of biomarkers for early detection and treatment for gastric cancer are two important gaps that proteomics have the potential to fill. Advancements in mass spectrometry, sample preparation and separation strategies are crucial to proteomics-based discoveries and subsequent translations from bench to bedside. A great number of studies exploiting various subproteomic approaches have emerged for higher-resolution analysis (compared with shotgun proteomics) that permit interrogation of different post-translational and subcellular compartmentalized forms of the same proteins as determinants of disease phenotypes. This is a unique and key strength of proteomics over genomics. In this review, the salient features, competitive edges and pitfalls of various subproteomic approaches are discussed. We also highlight valuable insights from several subproteomic studies that have increased our understanding of the molecular etiology of gastric cancer and the findings that led to the discovery of potential biomarkers/drug targets that were otherwise not revealed by conventional shotgun expression proteomics.
