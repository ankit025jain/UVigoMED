{"id":87527,"title":"Anatomical fit of seven different palmar distal radius plates.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare the anatomical fit of different, precontoured palmar distal radius plates.The anatomical fit of seven different types of palmar distal radius plates [Königsee variable fixed-angle radius plate 7/3-hole, Königsee variable fixed-angle radius plate 5/3-hole (Allendorf, Germany), Medartis 2.5 Adaptive TriLock, Medartis 2.5 TriLock, Medartis 2.5 TriLock extraarticular, (Basel, Switzerland), Synthes VA-LCP distal two-column-radius, Synthes LCP extraarticular (Bettlach, Switzerland)] were investigated in 25 embalmed human cadaveric radii. An imprint of the space between the well-positioned plate and the distal radius was attained using a silicone mass and the maximum height of the silicone imprint was digitally measured. The mean maximum imprint height was compared between the seven plates using an analysis of variance with repeated measures and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.The mean maximum distance between the plates and the radial cortex was <2 mm for all plates. The greatest difference was found with the Medartis Adaptive (1.99 ± 0.45 mm) and the least difference with the Synthes two-column (1.56 ± 0.76 mm), this difference being statistically significant (p = 0.005).Although there was no complete congruency between the plates and the radial cortex, all distal palmar radius plates investigated in this study presented a reasonable anatomical shape. The Synthes VA-LCP distal two-column-radius plate palmar showed the best anatomical fit. A low profile and optimized anatomical precontouring minimizes irritation of the surrounding soft tissues and should be considered with plate design and implant choice.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108754","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.357443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Basel","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.276029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Bettlach, Switzerland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bettlach,_Switzerland"},{"name":"Bonferroni correction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction"},{"name":"Synthes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthes"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Multiple comparisons","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Imprint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprint"},{"name":"Carlo Emilio Bonferroni","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Emilio_Bonferroni"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"},{"name":"Embalming","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalming"}]}
