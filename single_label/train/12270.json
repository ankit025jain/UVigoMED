{"id":12270,"title":"Stifle disorders: cranial cruciate ligament, meniscus, upward fixation of the patella.","abstract":"Stifle injury in cattle can be a debilitating condition. Stifle injuries often present as nonspecific lameness with subtle clinical signs. Physical examination with manipulation of the stifle joint, radiographs, and analysis of the joint fluid can help to make a diagnosis. Cranial cruciate and collateral ligament injuries are among the most common traumatic injuries of the stifle joint. Although the prognosis is guarded, better success and less degenerative change are expected with early diagnosis and treatment. Meniscal injuries and upward fixation of the patella are less commonly diagnosed, but their clinical signs, treatment, and prognosis are discussed in this article.
