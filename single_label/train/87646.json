{"id":87646,"title":"[About the treatment of battlefield injuries of the musculoskeletal system with the help of new \"Rod field package\"].","abstract":"Injuries of the musculoskeletal system are at 60% of all battlefield injures and take first place in modern military conflicts. The main antishock measures are: pain management, emergency bleeding control, bone fragment positioning and fracture fixation. Specialist of the centre of traumatology and orthopaedics of the Burdenko General Military Clinical Hospital in cooperation with specialists of department of battlefield surgery of Mandryka Clinical Research and Training Medical Centre analysed the most effective domestic and foreign external fixators and developed Rod field package (RFP). The above mentioned researched had two stages. On the first (analytical) stage specialists formulated requirements for idea rod field external fixator. On the second (experimental) stage tests with the help of plastic models of long bones were carried out. The performed analysis showed, that installation of the external fixator is easy and fast, the external fixator is light and has capabilities for 3D bone fragment positioning and fracture fixation, the external fixator is radiotransparent. Implementation of this package into the clinical practice of delivery of battlefield emergency surgical care may improve results of treatment.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Wounds and
