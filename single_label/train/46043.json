{"id":46043,"title":"Peyer's patches play a protective role in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy in mice.","abstract":"Peyer's patches (PPs) play a major role in mucosal immunity. However, their roles in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy are poorly understood.Wild-type (WT) and PP-null mice were injected with indomethacin. Twenty-four hours later, the cellular profiles and cytokine levels in the PPs, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine were measured. WT and PP-null mice were given antibiotics before indomethacin treatment to evaluate enteropathy. Naive CD4 T cells were co-cultured with CD103 or CD103 dendritic cells (DCs) to analyze the interleukin (IL)-10 expression levels. Finally, WT mice adoptively transferred with CD103 or CD103 DCs were injected with indomethacin.The proportion of CD103 DCs in PPs and MLNs and IL-10-expressing CD4 T cells of PPs and the LP increased after indomethacin treatment. The PP-null mice showed greater indomethacin-induced enteropathy, fewer CD103 DCs in their MLNs, and lower proportion of IL-10-expressing CD4 T cells of their LP than WT mice, regardless of commensal bacteria. Naive splenic CD4 T cells co-cultured with CD103 DCs isolated from the MLNs of indomethacin-injected WT mice produced a higher amount of IL-10 compared with those co-cultured with CD103 DCs. Moreover, WT mice that received CD103 DCs showed milder enteropathy than those that received CD103 DCs.PPs play a protective role in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy, and this protection is associated with an increase in CD103 DCs and IL-10-producing CD4 T cells in the intestine, independent of the commensal bacteria.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651581","annotations":[{"name":"Lamina propria","weight":0.935439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamina_propria"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.933031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Indometacin","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Commensalism","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.718219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.547122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.270331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.21707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"ITGAE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITGAE"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Enteropathy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteropathy"}]}
