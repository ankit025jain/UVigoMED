{"id":46442,"title":"COLOSTRO NONI administration effects on epithelial cells turn-over, inflammatory events and integrity of intestinal mucosa junctional systems.","abstract":"In this work we evaluated the possibility for dietary supplement COLOSTRO NONI to be used as preventive and therapeutic agent in various diseases characterized by altered intestinal homeostasis with changes in the composition of the microbiota, alteration of the morphology and functionality, and also inflammation of the epithelium.Cellular activity of COLOSTRO NONI has been tested in an in vitro model of intestinal epithelium based on Caco-2 cell line. We tested the ability of COLOSTRO NONI to stimulate cellular turnover evaluating cell growth rate with WST-1 proliferation assay. We also tested the ability of COLOSTRO NONI to increase the gene expression of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) with a Real Time PCR assay. IL-8 is a fundamental chemotactic factor involved in inflammatory phenomena and in the control of tissue homeostasis.COLOSTRO NONI is able to stimulate cell turnover in the proposed in vitro model and demonstrates active in increasing the gene expression of IL-8. Both aspects observed are fundamental for the establishment of mechanisms to repair tissue damage.Obtained results indicate that COLOSTRO NONI could find clinical application in treatment of gastrointestinal disorders characterized by impairment of proper intestinal permeability, in inflammatory bowel diseases, in dysenteric diseases, in gastritis and in forms of pathological alteration of the mucous layer as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Digestive System
