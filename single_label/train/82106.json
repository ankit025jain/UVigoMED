{"id":82106,"title":"Keratocystic odontogenic tumor: treatment modalities: study of 3 cases.","abstract":"Management of the keratocystic odontogenic tumor has been one of the most controversial entities of the maxillofacial surgery. It can become quite large because of its ability for significant expansion, extension into adjacent tissues and rapid growth and also has high reccurence rate as it shows a thin, friable wall, which is often difficult to enucleate from the bone in toto, and have small satellite cysts within the fibrous wall. There are various treatment modalities suggested from conservative to radical approach, but studies have shown even with conservative approach good results are achieved. In this paper we are presenting various treatment modalities and 3 cases have been discussed.
