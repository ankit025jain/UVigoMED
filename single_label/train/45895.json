{"id":45895,"title":"An overview of magnetic resonance enterography for Crohn's disease.","abstract":"Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a relatively new imaging modality that has shown promise for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring Crohn's disease (CD) and its complications while avoiding exposure to ionizing radiation. In addition to clinical implications, MRE has the potential to be used as an objective measure of disease activity for clinical trials. We provide the rationale for MRE, indications for its use, and an overview of the typical procedure and common findings for institutions who want to begin or refine the use of MRE for CD.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659238","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.856651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Ionizing radiation","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.661918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.627802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.602143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.549868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.541905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.461972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.223438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Meal, Ready-to-Eat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Refining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refining"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"}]}
