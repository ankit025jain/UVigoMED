{"id":460,"title":"Interleukin-3 and interleukin-17 do not play a dynamic role in the immunopathogenesis of osteoarticular tuberculosis.","abstract":"Osteoarticular tuberculosis accounts for one to three per cent of all cases of active TB. IL-3 stimulates the proliferation, differentiation and survival of pluripotent stem cells. IL-17 has shown to promote inflammatory cell recruitment and granuloma organization throughout infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. During the chronic phase of the infection, a balance between Th1 and Th17 responses needs to be achieved to limit immunopathology.To correlate the serum levels of IL-3 and IL-17 at presentation and after completion of treatment in clinicoradiologically proven cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis.32 clinicoradiologically confirmed cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis were included. Archived serum samples of eight patients of osteoarticular tuberculosis of an earlier study, confirmed by PCR, AFB smear or by histopathology with previously determined IL-12 and TGF-beta levels were available. A detailed history was noted and their general physical, local and relevant systemic examination was performed. Various laboratory parameters including TL-3 and IL-17 levels in serum were estimated at presentation and at six months of DOTS CAT-1 treatment.There was a significant improvement in the clinical and radiological parameters after treatment. No correlation was found between IL-3 and IL-17 levels before and after treatment. A significant correlation (p value= 0.022) was shown between levels of IL-3 and IL-12 after six months of treatment.Qualitative and quantitative fluctuations in IL-3 and IL-17 levels were not able to serve as useful indices of disease activity.","date":"2014-12-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
