{"id":30527,"title":"Subchronic, reproductive, and maternal toxicity studies with tertiary butyl acetate (TBAC).","abstract":"Tertiary-butyl acetate (TBAC) was tested for subchronic toxicity in rats and mice and reproductive toxicity in rats at inhalation concentrations of 0, 100, 400 or 1600ppm. An oral maternal toxicity study was conducted in rats at dose levels of 0, 400, 800, 1000 and 1600mgkg(-1)d(-1). In the inhalation studies, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, gross pathology and the majority of body weight and feed consumption values were unaffected. Exposure to TBAC at concentrations of 400ppm and higher caused transient hyperactivity in mice and some evidence of increased motor activity counts in male rats at the 1600ppm exposure level. TBAC caused ?2u-globulin accumulation in male rat kidneys from all exposure groups and increased liver weights in 1600ppm rats and mice. Levels of thyroxin were decreased in male mice exposed to 1600ppm TBAC for 4weeks but otherwise thyroid endpoints were unaffected in rats and mice at either the 4 or 13weeks time points. There was no evidence or immunotoxicity or reproductive toxicity in rats. Pregnant rats receiving 1000mgkg(-1)d(-1) TBAC exhibited severe signs of acute neurotoxicity and decreased feed consumption and body weight gain. Fetal viability and growth were unaffected.
