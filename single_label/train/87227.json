{"id":87227,"title":"[Case-control study on therapeutic effects of different fixation methods for the treatment of olecranon fracture].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical effects by comparing three different fixation methods: tension band, hollow lag screw and anatomical plate.From January 2010 to January 2012, 82 patients with olecranon fractures who underwent surgical treatments were followed-up. All the patients were divided into three groups: tension band fixation group (group A), hollow lag screw fixation group (group B), anatomical plate fixation (group C). In group A, there were 35 patients, including 19 males and 16 females, ranging in age from 32 to 49 years old, with an average of (43.6 ± 8.7) years old, and the patients were treated with tension band fixation. According to Colton classification, there were 5 cases of type I, 3 cases of type II A,19 cases of type II B, and 8 cases of type II C in group A. Among 20 patients in group B, there were 13 males and 7 females, ranging in age from 27 to 50 years old, with an average of (41.5 ± 9.3) years old. The patients in group B were treated with hollow lag screw fixation. According to Colton classification, there were 4 cases of type I, 4 cases of type II A, and 12 cases of type II B in group B. In group C, there were 27 patients totally, including 15 males and 12 females, ranging in age from 30 to 55 years old, with an average of (38.2 ± 6.2) years old. The patients in group C were treated with anatomical plate fixation. According to Colton classification, there were 4 cases of type II B, 13 cases of type II C, and 10 cases of type II D in group C. The Fracture healing time, complications and functional recovery were retrospectively observed and recorded.All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 8 to 24 months, with an average of 15 months. The average healing time of patients in group C was the longest among three groups. The flexion-extension and rotation activities of elbow joint in group B and C were better than that in group C. According to Broberg & Morrey score system, the therapeutic effects of patients in group A and B were better than that of group C. In group C, 2 patients had incision infections, 6 patients complained of foreign body sensation, 1 patient got a delayed fracture healing, and 1 patient had the heterotopic ossification. There were no occurrences of incision infections in group A and B; internal fixation loosening occurred in 3 patients in group A and 2 patients in group B; delayed fracture healing occurred in 2 patients in group A and 2 patients in group B; and skin bursa formation occurred in 6 patients in group A and 1 patient in group B.All the three ways are effective methods for the treatment of olecranon fractures. Fixation methods should be selected depending on the type of fracture.","date":"2015-01-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577907","annotations":[{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Olecranon","weight":0.731812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olecranon"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Synovial bursa","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_bursa"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.594769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.472668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.227905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.124295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Heterotopic ossification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotopic_ossification"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.028901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Effective results in number theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_results_in_number_theory"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Lag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Charles B.
