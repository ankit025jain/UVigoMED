{"id":81101,"title":"Diagnosis of gnathostomiasis by skin testing using partially purified specific antigen and total IgE levels.","abstract":"A finding of antibodies to Gnathostoma spinigerum 24-kDa antigen by immunoblot analysis is currently used to confirm a diagnosis of gnathostomiasis. A simple skin test for the diagnosis of gnathostomiasis was developed, and the results were evaluated and compared with the standard Western blot (WB) test.This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand, in 2008-2011. All eligible patients were tested with partially purified proteins of mAb-detected fractions pooled and sterilized by 0.2 ?m diameter syringe filter, with a phenol saline solution of 1:10 w/v.A total of 69 cases, 39 gnathostomiasis cases and 30 controls, were enrolled into the study; the median age (IQR) was 40 (30.5-52.5) years. The most common presenting symptom was edema (56/69, 81%). Gnathostomiasis cases having strong cutaneous reactions to the intradermal test (81%) were also positive by immunoblot. A significant correlation between skin and immunoblot tests was detected (p<0.001). The difference in total IgE levels between cases and controls was not statistically significant (p=0.51). Logistic regression models showed that positive WB and skin-test results were significantly associated with gnathostomiasis (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively).Gnathostoma skin testing, using prepared fractionated antigen solution of Gnathostoma spinigerum, yields good reactivity and significantly correlates with the results of immunoblot testing.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463581","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.813624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.745665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.735959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Phenol","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.717521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.479736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.468265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syringe","weight":0.292047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.213149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Bangkok","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok"},{"name":"Gnathostomiasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnathostomiasis"},{"name":"Gnathostoma spinigerum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnathostoma_spinigerum"},{"name":"Gnathostoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnathostoma"},{"name":"Sterilization (microbiology)","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Tropical disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_disease"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
