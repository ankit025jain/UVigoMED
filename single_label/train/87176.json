{"id":87176,"title":"RNA virus reverse genetics and vaccine design.","abstract":"RNA viruses are capable of rapid spread and severe or potentially lethal diseaseÂ in both animals and humans. The development of reverse genetics systems for manipulation and study of RNA virus genomes has provided platforms for designing and optimizing viral mutants for vaccine development. Here, we review the impact of RNA virus reverse genetics systems on past and current efforts to design effective and safe viral therapeutics and vaccines.
