{"id":83441,"title":"Lumbar and thoracic perforators: vascular anatomy and clinical implications.","abstract":"Pedicled perforator flaps in the thoracic and lumbar regions allow reconstruction of the posterior trunk. They enable reconstruction of various local defects without microvascular anastomoses and with minimal donor-site morbidity and excellent cosmesis. The authors examined the locations of perforators in the lumbar and thoracic regions.Ten cadaver hemithoraces and lumbar regions were freshly harvested and dissected. Intraarterial injections were performed with colored latex, followed by dissection in the suprafascial plane. Perforators with a diameter larger than 0.5 cm were located and measured from the midline and from C7 (thoracic) and coccygeal (lumbar) reference points. The most dominant perforators were injected with radiopaque dye and scanned with high-resolution computed tomography. The patterns were analyzed by the quadrat counting test (based on chi-square statistics) for the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness.A total of 164 thoracic and 216 lumbar perforators were identified. These were clustered in highest density in two major areas within 10 to 20 cm of the C7 and coccygeal reference points and 10 cm from the midline; this pattern was not a random distribution (p < 0.001). Perforasomes of lumbar perforators in some instances crossed the midline, joining adjacent contralateral lumbar perforators by means of direct and indirect linking vessels.Lumbar and thoracic pedicled perforator flaps provide useful options for reconstructing complex defects. Use of these flaps is aided by anatomical knowledge of the location of major clusters of perforators.","date":"2014-10-31","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
