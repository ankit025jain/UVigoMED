{"id":53180,"title":"NF-?B inducing kinase, a central signaling component of the non-canonical pathway of NF-?B, contributes to ovarian cancer progression.","abstract":"Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of female death and the development of novel therapeutic approaches is urgently required. Nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) is constitutively activated in several types of cancer including ovarian cancer and is known to support the survival of cancer cells. However, molecular mechanisms of persistent activation of NF-?B in ovarian cancer remain largely unknown. We report here that, in addition to the previously reported canonical activation, NF-?B is activated through the noncanonical pathway in ovarian cancer cells. RNA interference-mediated silencing of NF-?B inducing kinase (NIK), a central regulator of the noncanonical pathway, reduced the NF-?B2/p52 DNA binding activity and NF-?B-dependent reporter gene expression as well as NF-?B target gene expression. Notably, anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth was impaired in NIK-depleted cells. Depletion of NIK also suppressed tumor formation in the nude mouse xenograft assay. These results indicate that NIK plays a key role in constitutive NF-?B activation and the progression of ovarian cancer cells and suggest that NIK represents an attractive therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.
