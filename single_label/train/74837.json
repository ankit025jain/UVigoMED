{"id":74837,"title":"[Laws of acupoint selection of prescriptions for treatment of cervicogenic headache by acupuncture: a modern literature research].","abstract":"To summarize laws of acupoint selection of prescriptions for treatment of cervicogenic headache by acupuncture in modern literature.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving acupuncture and moxibustion for treatment of cervicogenic headache were recruited from CBM (1978-2012), VIP (1989-2012), Wanfang Database (1998-2012), CNKI (1979-2012), PubMed (1966-2012), EMbase (1980-2012), and Cochrane Library (Volume 4, 2012). Hand recruitment was also auxiliarily used. The frequency and percentage of common acupoints, the distribution of acupoints along 14 meridians and across each part of the body, the application of specific acupoints, and features of using prescriptions for specific acupoints were statistically described.Totally 37 recruited papers included 42 acupoints and 159 times. Common acupoints covered Fengchi (GB20, 28 times), Jingjiaji (EX-B2, 21 times), Baihui (DU 20, 12 times), Tianzhu (BL9, 1 times), and Ashi point (11 times). Meridians along which acupoints were used mainly covered Foot-shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian, Foot-taiyang Bladder Meridian,and DU meridian. Acupoints were mainly needled from head, neck, and upper limbs. Eight confluence points and luo-connecting point were commonest used as specific acupoints. Acupuncture prescriptions were mostly composed of multiple acupoints. Filliform needle was mainly used in acupuncture methods, followed by electro-acupuncture needle.Modern acupuncture treatment of cervicogenic headache focuses on local specific points and acupoints along meridians. Acupoints were mostly selected from head, neck, and upper limbs by syndrome typing of Chinese medicine.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223190","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.908618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.712713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.584469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.581217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"China","weight":0.482133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.449924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Meridian (Chinese medicine)","weight":0.31885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(Chinese_medicine)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.229542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.20626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Meridian (geography)","weight":0.129763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Meridian","weight":0.037812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"British Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
