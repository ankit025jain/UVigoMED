{"id":51780,"title":"Aberrant brain functional connectivity related to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes: a resting-state fMRI study.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, which is involved in the development of Alzheimer disease. This study aims to investigate the relationship between abnormal resting-state brain functional connectivity and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.A total of 30 patients with type 2 diabetes and 31 healthy well-matched volunteers were prospectively examined. Resting-state brain functional connectivity analysis was used to examine the correlation between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and whole-brain regions. The possible relationships between functional connectivity measures and insulin resistance were evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).Compared with healthy controls, we observed significantly decreased functional connectivity of the PCC within some selected regions, including the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and left precentral gyrus; increased functional connectivity of the PCC was detected in the left cerebellum posterior lobe, right superior frontal gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus. A significant negative correlation was found between the PCC-right MTG connectivity and HOMA-IR in type 2 diabetic patients (P = 0.014; r = -0.446).Type 2 diabetic patients develop aberrant functional connectivity of the PCC, which is associated with insulin resistance in selected brain regions. Resting-state connectivity disturbance of PCC-MTG may be a central role for evaluating the cognitive dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658392","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.82961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Middle temporal gyrus","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_temporal_gyrus"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Middle frontal gyrus","weight":0.806612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_frontal_gyrus"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Cingulate cortex","weight":0.795826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cingulate_cortex"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Primary motor cortex","weight":0.763876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_motor_cortex"},{"name":"Superior frontal gyrus","weight":0.755977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_frontal_gyrus"},{"name":"Functional neuroimaging","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neuroimaging"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.737494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Occipital lobe","weight":0.735266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Gyrus","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.707852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Posterior cingulate","weight":0.707819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cingulate"},{"name":"List of regions in the human brain","weight":0.689487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.665559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.659865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.597676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.488787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.415279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.39749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.374681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.359241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.249688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.0550795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Lingual gyrus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingual_gyrus"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"}]}
