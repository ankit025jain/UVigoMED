{"id":30034,"title":"Effects of L-tryptophan on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the L-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated macaque model of Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"In animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), the serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system is thought to play an important pathophysiological role in the development and expression of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia (LID). These abnormal involuntary movements are associated with the unregulated release of dopamine from 5-HT fibres. Thus, modulating the false neurotransmitter release from 5-HT neurons, via attuning the serotonin tone, may be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of LID. In this study, we investigated the effects of the primary precursor of 5-HT, l-tryptophan, on LID in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated macaques. l-tryptophan treatment (0.5-5.0g) dramatically abolished the expression of LID. However, this effect was associated with worsening of the therapeutic effects of L-DOPA. These behavioural data further support the role of the serotonergic system in expression of LID, highlighting the difficult challenge of targeting 5-HT neurons for alleviating dyskinesia and maintaining the therapeutic response of L-DOPA.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572591","annotations":[{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.817748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Serotonergic","weight":0.791677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonergic"},{"name":"Dyskinesia","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyskinesia"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Macaque","weight":0.563779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.512671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.415311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Synaptic vesicle","weight":0.0797502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_vesicle"},{"name":"Phenyl group","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenyl_group"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Dihydroxyphenylalanine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydroxyphenylalanine"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.0261065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Volition (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volition_(psychology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
