{"id":79241,"title":"[Radiation therapy of sinonasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma].","abstract":"Natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma are part of lymphoproliferative diseases, they are rare in Europe and the United States but relatively common in Asia and South America. Natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma present clinically as destructive lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract with perforation of deep structures of the face, destruction of the palate or an invasion of orbits. Treatment modalities of these lymphomas are still discussed because of the lack of available studies and the rarity of this disease. Radiotherapy provides a rapid control of the disease and is positioned as a major treatment of localized stages of NK/T-cell lymphoma of the nasal cavity. We therefore studied the different forms of radiation therapy in the early stages of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.
