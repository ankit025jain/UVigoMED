{"id":83069,"title":"Overexpression of fibronectin confers cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) against 5-FU in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.","abstract":"The tumor-associated microenvironment has been shown to protect tumor cells from treatment, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to affect drug resistance as a key regulator of the tumor microenvironment. However, little is known about cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) due to cell-ECM contact in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the present study, we evaluated the ECM molecule fibronectin (FN) using DNA microarray data obtained from parental and 5-FU-resistant OSCC cell lines. We investigated the effects of cell adhesion to FN on 5-FU resistance in OSCC cells and examined the activation of FN receptor ?1 integrin-mediated survival regulators such as ILK, Akt and NF-?B. In addition, we investigated whether FNIII14, a 22-mer peptide derived from FN that potently prevents ?1 integrin-mediated adhesion to FN, could overcome CAM-DR against 5-FU in OSCC cells and examined the activation of survival regulators and apoptosis-related molecules. Consequently, we obtained the following results. FN was extracellularly overexpressed in the 5-FU-resistant cells compared with that observed in the 5-FU-sensitive cells. Cell adhesion to FN enhanced 5-FU resistance and activated integrin-mediated ILK/Akt/NF-?B survival signaling in the 5-FU-resistant OSCC cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of cell adhesion to FN by FNIII14 enhanced chemosensitivity to 5-FU and apoptosis by suppressing ILK/Akt/NF-?B signaling in the 5-FU-resistant cells. These novel findings demonstrate that FN is a potentially useful biomarker and therapeutic target for improving the treatment of OSCC, particularly in the setting of 5-FU resistance.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452447","annotations":[{"name":"DNA microarray","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.89669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.881188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.828729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.804709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.739164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.603836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.571659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.541137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.425307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.383118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.354069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Integrin-linked kinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin-linked_kinase"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
