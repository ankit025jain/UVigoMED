{"id":79161,"title":"[Clinical analysis of surgical approaches and efficacy of benign occupying lesion of unilateral maxillary sinus].","abstract":"To investigate the therapeutic methods and efficacy of benign occupying lesion of unilateral maxillary sinus.The clinical data of 84 patients treated with endoscopic surgery from June 2005 to June 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Among these patients, 39 cases were treated by endoscopic surgery only, 18 cases were treated by endoscopic plus modified Caldwell-Luc technique, 15 cases were treated by endoscopic plus inferior meatus antrostomy approach, and 12 cases were treated by endoscopic anterior lacrimal recess approach. All patients were followed up postoperatively.All cases were followed up from 4 months to 7 years. Among them,81 cases had no recurrence,whereas three cases recurred during the follow-up period. All cases were preoperatively diagnosed by CT, MRI or intranasal endoscopy,which were confirmed by pathological examination postoperatively.Maxillary cyst and fungal maxillary sinusitis are the major types of benign occupying lesions of maxillary sinus. According to different clinical features of benign occupying lesions of maxillary sinus,different surgical approaches should be adopted. It can not only effectively cure maxillary sinus lesions, but aslo minimize the operation trauma. Endoscopic sinus surgery is the preferred technique for treating benign occupying lesions of maxillary sinus.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479357","annotations":[{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.647034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.53313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.520074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Maxillary sinus","weight":0.284345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.281533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.248946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Ear canal","weight":0.0775802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
