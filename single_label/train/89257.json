{"id":89257,"title":"[Psychosocial nursing care patient with major burns].","abstract":"We must consider the patient as a human being from a holistic point of view; that is, not only from a physical point of view, but also from a mental emotional and spiritual perspective (not to be confused with religion). A patient with major burns is seen as a critical patient by the physician, and for him the most important issue is the survival of the patient. It is when the patient is admitted in the Burns Unit when the long and not easy road to recovery begins, in the understanding this is a new way to integrate, feel and ultimately learn to live again. The role of nursing during this journey will be vital. The prompt and better recovery of the patient will largely depend on the link established between nurse and patient, as well as his/her integration in the new life that awaits him. The following topics are developed in this article: Emotional evolution during his stage in the Burns Unit. Psychoemotional nursing care (fear, pain, image change, long hospital stay, resources). Management of the self-protection measures of the nursing staff to maintain its own emotional stability.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738175","annotations":[{"name":"Religion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Spirituality","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality"},{"name":"Holism","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.751478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.6405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.591405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.374202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.303001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.206619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0878161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Narrative mode","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_mode"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Globalization","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"}]}
