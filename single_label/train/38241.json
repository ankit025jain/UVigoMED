{"id":38241,"title":"ABCC9 is a novel Brugada and early repolarization syndrome susceptibility gene.","abstract":"Genetic defects in KCNJ8, encoding the Kir6.1 subunit of the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel (I(K-ATP)), have previously been associated with early repolarization (ERS) and Brugada (BrS) syndromes. Here we test the hypothesis that genetic variants in ABCC9, encoding the ATP-binding cassette transporter of IK-ATP (SUR2A), are also associated with both BrS and ERS.Direct sequencing of all ERS/BrS susceptibility genes was performed on 150 probands and family members. Whole-cell and inside-out patch-clamp methods were used to characterize mutant channels expressed in TSA201-cells. Eight ABCC9 mutations were uncovered in 11 male BrS probands. Four probands, diagnosed with ERS, carried a highly-conserved mutation, V734I-ABCC9. Functional expression of the V734I variant yielded a Mg-ATP IC?? that was 5-fold that of wild-type (WT). An 18-y/o male with global ERS inherited an SCN5A-E1784K mutation from his mother, who displayed long QT intervals, and S1402C-ABCC9 mutation from his father, who displayed an ER pattern. ABCC9-S1402C likewise caused a gain of function of IK-ATP with a shift of ATP IC?? from 8.5 ± 2 mM to 13.4 ± 5 ?M (p<0.05). The SCN5A mutation reduced peak INa to 39% of WT (p<0.01), shifted steady-state inactivation by -18.0 mV (p<0.01) and increased late I(Na) from 0.14% to 2.01% of peak I(Na) (p<0.01).Our study is the first to identify ABCC9 as a susceptibility gene for ERS and BrS. Our findings also suggest that a gain-of-function in I(K-ATP) when coupled with a loss-of-function in SCN5A may underlie type 3 ERS, which is associated with a severe arrhythmic phenotype.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
