{"id":43390,"title":"Y-shaped bilateral self-expandable metallic stent placement for malignant hilar biliary obstruction: data from a referral center for palliative care.","abstract":"Malignant hilar strictures are a clinical challenge because of the current therapeutic approach and the poor prognosis. In recent years, self-expandable metallic stents have proven more effective than plastic stents for palliation of malignant hilar strictures, with the bilateral stent-in-stent technique registering a high success rate. We report our experience with Y-shaped endoscopic self-expandable metallic stents placement for treatment of advanced malignant hilar strictures.From April 2009 to August 2012, we prospectively collected data on patients treated with Y-shaped SEMS placement for advanced malignant hilar carcinoma. Data on technical success, clinical success, and complications were collected.Twenty patients (9 males) were treated (mean age 64.2 ± 15.3 years). The grade of malignant hilar strictures according to the Bismuth classification was II in 5 patients (25%), IIIa in 1 (5%), and IV in 14 (70%). The mean bilirubin level was 14.7 ± 4.9 mg/dL. Technical success was achieved in all patients, with a significant reduction in bilirubin levels (2.9 ± 1.7 mg/dL). One patient experienced cholangitis as early complication, while in 2 patients stent ingrowth was observed. No stents migration was recorded. There was no procedure-related mortality. At the end of the follow-up (7.1 ± 3.1 months), 13 of the 20 patients (65%) had died.Our experience confirms endoscopic bilateral self-expandable metallic stents placement with stent-in-stent technique (Y-shaped configuration) as a feasible, effective, and safe procedure for palliation of unresectable malignant hilar strictures.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24790548","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.712304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.681948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.633922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.607321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.595153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.256114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.229215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.222685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0652597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Hilum (anatomy)","weight":0.0315655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Enantiomer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Cholangitis","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangitis"}]}
