{"id":61426,"title":"Effect of microRNA-210 on prognosis and response to chemotherapeutic drugs in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","abstract":"Many studies have demonstrated that microRNA-210 (miR-210) expression is intensively upregulated in hypoxic states and differentially regulated in most types of cancer cells. However, the clinical significance of miR-210 and its effects on the response of leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic drugs in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remain unknown. In the current study, using real-time qRT-PCR to detect miR-210 expression in bone marrow samples from 114 children at initial diagnosis of ALL, we investigated the prognostic significance of miR-210 and determined its associations with common clinical characteristics and treatment outcome. We further examined its effect on the response to chemotherapeutic drugs in the Reh and RS4;11 cell lines. Results showed that miR-210 expression was significantly lower in patients suffering from relapse and induction failure than in other patients (P < 0.001). Using the receiver operating characteristic curve, 3.8243 was selected as the cut-off value of miR-210 expression in our test cohort (38 cases). A significantly poorer treatment outcome (P < 0.05) was found in the low-expression group and verified in the validation cohort (76 cases, P < 0.05). Patients with low expression of miR-210 and positive minimal residual disease at the end of induction had a much higher rate of relapse or induction failure (P = 0.001). Increasing/decreasing miR-210 expression using agomir/antagomir could enhance or reduce the response of Reh cells and RS4;11 cells to daunorubicin/dexamethasone/L-asparaginase and daunorubicin/dexamethasone/vincristine, respectively. In conclusion, miR-210 may be a good prognostic factor and a useful predictor of drug sensitivity, and is a potential therapeutic target for pediatric ALL.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720529","annotations":[{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.869415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.813152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.6891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.676137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.533157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.358022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0829469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"}]}
