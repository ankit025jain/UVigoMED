{"id":30417,"title":"Transient cocaine-induced chest pain: a case series.","abstract":"Acute chest pain and myocardial infarction are frequent complications of cocaine use. Indeed, these represent 40% of emergency department visits associated with cocaine use and 2% to 7% of all patients attending the emergency department for chest pain. Nevertheless, the prevalence of past cocaine-associated chest pain has never been evaluated in an outpatient facility for addiction. Our objective was to assess lifetime episodes of cocaine-associated chest pain in current cocaine users in an outpatient facility.Fifty consecutive, nonselected current cocaine users were retrospectively evaluated with a standardized interview and a medical assessment. The patients and the pain characteristics are described, and clinical and biological factors associated with experiencing cocaine-associated chest pain are studied with univariate and logistic regressions analyses.Twenty-six subjects (52%) reported a history of chest pain associated with cocaine use. This pain was frequently described as oppressive (28%) and located in the retrosternal area (61.5%). The mean (±SD) time between cocaine use and the occurrence of the pain was 8 (±8) minutes and the mean duration was 22 (±236) minutes. Subjects who reported cocaine-associated chest pain reported an average of 12 (±7) distinct episodes. Patients describing chest pain could be predicted with one independent factor in our sample: age of onset of cocaine use (P = 0.042).Transient cocaine-associated chest pains are frequent in current cocaine users attending specialized addiction facilities. Cardiological explorations and monitoring and risk-reduction interventions need to be provided to this specific population.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Chemically-Induced
