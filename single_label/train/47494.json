{"id":47494,"title":"Pancreaticopleural fistula: an overlooked entity.","abstract":"Pleuropulmonary complications of pancreatitis are well known. Less commonly encountered is pancreaticopleural fistula. We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy with a presumed episode of pancreatitis, complicated by pseudocyst and development of a pancreaticopleural fistula. Successful medical management was achieved, and he made a full recovery. This case demonstrates that the rarity of such a condition leads to delay as well as challenges in diagnosis and management.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585655","annotations":[{"name":"Management","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.391104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Pseudocyst","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocyst"},{"name":"International development","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
