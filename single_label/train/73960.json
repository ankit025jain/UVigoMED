{"id":73960,"title":"Absolute calibration of the Gamma Knife® Perfexion™ and delivered dose verification using EPR/alanine dosimetry.","abstract":"Elekta Leksell Gamma Knife(®) (LGK) is a radiotherapy beam machine whose features are not compliant with the international calibration protocols for radiotherapy. In this scope, the Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel and the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital decided to conceive a new LKG dose calibration method and to compare it with the currently used one. Furthermore, the accuracy of the dose delivered by the LGK machine was checked using an \"end-to-end\" test. This study also aims to compare doses delivered by the two latest software versions of the Gammaplan treatment planning system (TPS).The dosimetric method chosen is the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of alanine. Dose rate (calibration) verification was done without TPS using a spherical phantom. Absolute calibration was done with factors calculated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCNP-X). For \"end-to-end\" test, irradiations in an anthropomorphic head phantom, close to real treatment conditions, are done using the TPS in order to verify the delivered dose.The comparison of the currently used calibration method with the new one revealed a deviation of +0.8% between the dose rates measured by ion chamber and EPR/alanine. For simple fields configuration (less than 16 mm diameter), the \"end-to-end\" tests showed out average deviations of -1.7% and -0.9% between the measured dose and the calculated dose by Gammaplan v9 and v10, respectively.This paper shows there is a good agreement between the new calibration method and the currently used one. There is also a good agreement between the calculated and delivered doses especially for Gammaplan v10.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24877803","annotations":[{"name":"Ion","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Radiation
