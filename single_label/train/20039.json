{"id":20039,"title":"Role of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in immunocompetent patients.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) in imaging of extrapulmonary tuberculosis.Eighteen patients with single-site extrapulmonary tuberculosis were evaluated with contrast-enhanced dedicated MRI of the clinically symptomatic site followed by WB-MRI using contrast-enhanced 3-dimensional (3D) modified DIXON technique (m-DIXON) and diffusion-weighted WB imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) sequences. Studies were read by 2 experienced radiologists, and additional lesions seen on WB-MRI were separately charted.Of 18 patients, 14 were found to have asymptomatic involvement of other organs on WB-MRI. In 5 patients, the information was helpful in choosing an easily accessible site for biopsy/aspiration. Postcontrast 3D m-DIXON was better in picking up brain and lymph nodal lesions, whereas DWIBS was better in detecting vertebral lesions.Whole-body MRI may be used for assessing the asymptomatic involvement of other body organs in tuberculosis. The combination of postcontrast 3D m-DIXON and DWIBS is complementary and may provide a road map for biopsy of accessible lesions.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681855","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.809475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.736231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.726325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.712569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.512701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.402877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.226286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.16798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.0697704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"The WB Television Network","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB_Television_Network"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
