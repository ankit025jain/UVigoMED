{"id":12293,"title":"Identification of tumor-initiating cells in a canine hepatocellular carcinoma cell line.","abstract":"Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subset of tumor cells, are involved in tumor initiation, progression, recurrence and metastasis. In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TICs are enriched with cell surface markers and have the ability to self-renew and differentiate tumors at a high frequency. We established a canine HCC cell line, HCC930599, and analyzed it for stem and progenitor cell marker expression using flow cytometry. HCC930599 showed high CD44 and CD29, moderate CD90, and low CD133, CD34, CD24, CD117, and CD13 expression. CD90(+)CD44(+) and CD90(-)CD44(+) cells were characterized using the in vitro sphere assay and an in vivo transplant model. CD90(+)CD44(+) cells acquired enhanced self-renewal capacity, proliferative activity and tumourigenicity compared with CD90(-)CD44(+) cells, suggesting that TICs exist in the HCC930599 cell line and that CD90 is a marker for enriched TICs. Understanding TIC characteristics may help elucidate hepatic carcinogenesis and HCC therapy development.
