{"id":82453,"title":"Oral epithelial barrier function and the role of nuclear factor kappa-? pathway in the pathogenesis of aphthous ulceration.","abstract":"The normal oral mucosa is usually tolerant to its special microenvironment. Epithelial integrity and a wellmanaged immune system are important in sustaining harmony. A close look at the role played by adaptive immunity during recurrent aphthous ulcerations may throw some light into the pathogenesis.In this report, we provide a concise review of oral epithelial barrier function and present data on the possible pathogenetic mechanism of aphthous ulceration using immunohistocemical signs of nuclear factor kappa beta pathway activation on fourteen cases of mucosal aphthous ulcerations.We strongly support the hypothesis that oral aphthous ulcerations develop as a result of loss of epithelial barrier function and that nuclear factor kappa beta signaling pathway seems to be involved in this type of injury.Interventions that strengthen the mucosal barrier function or modulate inappropriate activation of nuclear factor kappa beta signaling pathway can be considered in the treatment of oral aphthous ulcerations.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623290","annotations":[{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.636073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.572859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.570077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.56292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.531549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.333754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Aphthous ulcer","weight":0.155909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_ulcer"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0324486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mouth ulcer","weight":0.0243874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcer"}]}
