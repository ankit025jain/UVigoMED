{"id":42085,"title":"Colonic perforation following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-associated pancreatitis.","abstract":"We highlight a potentially lethal complication of acute severe pancreatitis that may not be suspected in severely ill patients. A 41-year-old woman developed acute severe pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. When her condition deteriorated dramatically after 2 weeks of intensive medical management, a computed tomography scan and water-soluble contrast enema examination revealed a large colonic perforation and associated collection in the right flank. Surgical management included an extended right hemicolectomy and a second laparotomy to attend to soiling at the surgical site. She survived and was discharged. Colonic perforation is a recognised complication of pancreatitis that carries a high mortality. It may result from a combination of ischaemia to the colon and a direct effect of noxious pancreatic enzymes. Almost all cases are only diagnosed at laparotomy. In view of the current trend of non-surgical management of pancreatitis and associated complications, colonic perforation should be considered in patients who deteriorate or fail to improve. To our knowledge this is the first case of a secure pre-operative diagnosis of colonic perforation due to to pancreatitis.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881137","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Enema","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enema"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.761812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.692276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.599351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.561818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.538257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.463746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Digestive enzyme","weight":0.389433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_enzyme"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Choledocholithiasis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choledocholithiasis"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
