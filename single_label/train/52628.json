{"id":52628,"title":"Synovial sarcoma of neck mimicking thyroid carcinoma.","abstract":"Synovial sarcoma (SS) in the neck is a very rare condition. Here we report a case of poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma in the neck of a 20 years old male patient presented with painless swelling in thyroid gland region. Initially he was diagnosed as thyroid mass clinically, by imaging and also by FNAC (Both in Bangladesh & India). But at surgery, it revealed paraoesophageal soft tissue tumor and subsequent histopathology showed synovial sarcoma. In young patient with neck swelling, the possibility of synovial sarcoma should be considered. As it does not have overall good prognosis, early detection and regular follow up is necessary.
