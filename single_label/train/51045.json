{"id":51045,"title":"Common genetic variation in the glucokinase gene (GCK) is associated with type 2 diabetes and rates of carbohydrate oxidation and energy expenditure.","abstract":"Glucokinase (GCK) plays a role in glucose metabolism and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Rare mutations in GCK cause MODY. We investigated whether common variation (minor allele frequency ?0.01) in GCK is associated with metabolic traits and type 2 diabetes.Four exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three SNPs predicted to cause loss of promoter function were identified in whole-genome sequence data from 234 Pima Indians. These seven tag SNPs and rs4607517, a type 2 diabetes variant established in other studies, were analysed in 415 full-heritage non-diabetic Pima Indians characterised for metabolic traits, and 7,667 American Indians who had data on type 2 diabetes and BMI.A novel 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) SNP, chr7:44184184-G/A, was associated with the rate of carbohydrate oxidation post-absorptively (??=?0.22 mg [kg estimated metabolic body size (EMBS)](-1)?min(-1), p?=?0.005) and during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (??=?0.24 mg [kg EMBS](-1)?min(-1), p?=?0.0002), the rate of carbohydrate oxidation in a respiratory chamber (??=?311 kJ/day, p?=?0.03) and 24 h energy expenditure, which was attributable to the thermic effect of food (??=?520 kJ/day, p?=?3.39?Ã—?10(-6)). This 3'UTR SNP was also associated with diabetes (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.11, 1.65, p?=?0.002), where the A allele (allele frequency 0.05) was associated with a lower rate of carbohydrate oxidation, lower 24 h energy expenditure and higher risk for diabetes. In a Cox proportional hazards model, a rate of insulin-stimulated carbohydrate oxidation lower than the mean rate at baseline predicted a higher risk for developing diabetes than for those above the mean (hazard rate ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.3, 3.6, p?=?0.002).Common variation in GCK influences the rate of carbohydrate oxidation, 24 h energy expenditure and diabetes risk in Pima Indians.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Endocrine System
