{"id":83125,"title":"A simple test for salivary gland function measuring resting and stimulated submandibular and sublingual secretions.","abstract":"This study examined the application of a simple screening test for salivary gland function by measuring resting and stimulated submandibular and sublingual secretions.An assay system was designed to use filter paper incorporating the chromophore of melanoidin or stimuli such as capsaicin and citric acid. We investigated the relationship between resting and stimulated secretions and melanoidin migration at 2 minutes for healthy and dry mouth groups.The healthy group showed a significant increase in the migration of melanoidin in the paper after citric acid or capsaicin stimulation. In contrast, patients with Sjögren syndrome showed no significant migration in spite of the stimulation. However, some participants with Sjögren syndrome or dry mouth showed a significant increase in the migration of melanoidin after stimulation.These results show that the newly developed method should be useful for evaluation of residual salivary gland function and screening for hyposalivation with dry mouth.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439915","annotations":[{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.696716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Capsaicin","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin"},{"name":"Citric acid","weight":0.283436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Filter paper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_paper"},{"name":"Chromophore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromophore"},{"name":"Sublingual administration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_administration"},{"name":"Melanoidin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoidin"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Filter (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Submandibular gland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submandibular_gland"},{"name":"Urbanization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
