{"id":47909,"title":"Equivocal association of RAD51 polymorphisms with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in a Chinese population.","abstract":"To study the contribution of genetic variation in RAD51 to risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RAD51 (rs1801320, rs4144242 and rs4417527) were genotyped in 316 ESCC patients and 316 healthy controls in Anyang area of China using PCR- RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism). Demographic variables between cases and controls were statistically compared by T test and Chi-square test. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated by the Chi-square test. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to measure any association with ESCC. Haplotype frequencies were estimated by Phase 2.1.The genotype frequencies of rs1801320, rs4144242 and rs4417527 in patients with ESCC demonstrated no significant differences from those in control group (P>0.05). When the haplotypes of these three SNPs were constructed and their relationships with ESCC risk investigated, however, CGG was observed to increase the risk (P=0.020, OR=2. 289).There was no association between the three SNPs of RAD51 and ESCC susceptibility in our Chinese population. However, the CGG haplotype might be a risk factor.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568492","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.900083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.735901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.684436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.664861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"China","weight":0.475955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.418165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.386135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.153971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"RAD51","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD51"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
