{"id":26653,"title":"[The analysis of the influence of short term physical effort on selected endothelial function parameters and blood vessels stiffness features among young and healthy men].","abstract":"Endothelium dysfunction is well established factor contributing to the development of atheroslerotic plaque. It is characterized by, among other, impaired vasodilatation and increased expression of adhesion molecules. The aim of the study was to estimate changes of serum selectin levels and blood vessels stiffness under the influence of short term physical effort in young healthy men characterized by various lifestyles.The study was performed on 28 healthy men aged 22 to 34. The study involved personal interview, electrocardiography, treadmill exercise test, non-invasive endothelial function assessment (using PulseTrace PCA 2) and collecting blood samples for serum E-, L- and P-selectin measurement. The given population was divided into smoking and non-smoking groups, as well as into groups with different level of physical activity assessed according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.In regard to serum selectin levels under the influence of short term physical effort E-selectin concentration didn't change significantly in any group, P-selectin level was lower in non-smoking group (p < 0.01) and in group with vigorous physical activity (p < 0.005), L-selectin level decreased in non-smokers (p < 0.005) and in groups taking moderate (p < 0.05) and vigorous exercise (p < 0.05). Baseline SI (stiffness index) value differed significantly between smoking and nonsmoking groups (p < 0.005). SI value didn't change significantly under effort in any group. RI (reflection index) value in measurements made after physical effort was significantly lower in each of examined groups, but decrease was better marked among non-smokers (p < 0.005) than in smokers (p < 0.05).The study revealed that individuals who undertake physical activity regularly, benefit from each single physical effort, because of decrease in serum concentration of proinflammatory molecules such as L-selectin and P-selectin. Short term physical effort does not influence the level of selectins in smokers. Smokers are characterized by increased arterial stiffness compared to nonsmokers. Short term physical effort leads to peripheral vasodilatation, expressed by decreasing RI value, but vasodilatation effect does not appear in smokers. It seems that pulse contour analysis obtained by finger photopletysmography may be treated as method of endothelium function screening among healthy men with the presence of atherogenesis modifiable risk factors.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Cardiovascular
