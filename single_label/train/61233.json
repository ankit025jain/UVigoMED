{"id":61233,"title":"Eosinophilia in mast cell disease.","abstract":"Eosinophils and mast cells coexist in clonal and nonclonal disorders. The interplay between these cells is complex and not fully understood. Discussed are both allergic/nonclonal disorders in which both cell types are increased in number are likely to play a role in pathogenesis and clonal disorders in which both cell types are affected and play key roles in pathogenesis. Finally, some treatment options, keeping both disorders in mind, are discussed. Future directions in thinking about these disorders are also briefly explored.
