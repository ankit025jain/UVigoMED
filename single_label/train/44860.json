{"id":44860,"title":"Complete pathological responses in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative IMRT and integrated-boost chemoradiation.","abstract":"To analyze the efficacy and safety of a new preoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and integrated-boost chemoradiation scheme.In all, 74 patients were treated with IMRT and concurrent standard dose capecitabine. The dose of the planning target volume (PTV) encompassing the tumor, mesorectum, and pelvic lymph nodes was 46 Gy in 23 fractions; the boost PTV, at a dose of 57.5 Gy in 23 fractions, included the macroscopic primary tumor and pathological lymph nodes. The patients underwent surgery 6-8 weeks after chemoradiation.The complete treatment data of 72 patients were analyzed. Tumor downstaging was achieved in 55 patients (76.38?%) and node downstaging in 34 (47.2?%). In 22 patients (30.6?%), there was complete pathological response (ypCR). The circumferential resection margin was free of tumor in 70 patients (97.2?%). The 3-year estimated overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 95.4 and 85.9?% respectively, and no local relapse was found; however, ten patients (13.8?%) developed distant metastases. High pathologic tumor (pT) downstaging was shown as a favorable prognostic factor for disease-free survival. No grade 4 acute radiotherapy-related toxicity was found.The IMRT and integrated-boost chemoradiation scheme offered higher rates of ypCR and pT downstaging, without a significant increase in toxicity. The circumferential margins were free of tumors in the majority of patients. Primary tumor regression was associated with better disease-free survival.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715243","annotations":[{"name":"Capecitabine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capecitabine"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.705716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.46808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.365899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.286121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.269423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.156944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Resection margin","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resection_margin"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tesla (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"}]}
