{"id":66094,"title":"Assisted maturation of native fistula in two patients with a continuous flow left ventricular assist device.","abstract":"Patients who receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) are prone to develop end-stage renal disease. Primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation in these patients may be unsuccessful secondary to the nonpulsatile flow with an LVAD. Two patients with LVADs are described in whom assisted maturation aided long-term AVF patency.
