{"id":7164,"title":"Targeted delivery of miRNA therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases: opportunities and challenges.","abstract":"Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been associated with many cardiovascular diseases in animal models, as well as in patients. In the present review, we summarize recent findings on the role of miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and discuss the opportunities, possibilities and challenges of using miRNAs as future therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we focus on the different approaches that can be used to deliver these newly developed miRNA therapeutics to their sites of action. Since siRNAs are structurally homologous with the miRNA therapeutics, important lessons learned from siRNA delivery strategies are discussed that might be applicable to targeted delivery of miRNA therapeutics, thereby reducing costs and potential side effects, and improving efficacy.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895056","annotations":[{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.799668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.738741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Active site","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_site"},{"name":"Protein structure","weight":0.411873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.376208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.209583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.15896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Targeted drug delivery","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
