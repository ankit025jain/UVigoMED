{"id":68384,"title":"Molecular subtyping of invasive bladder cancer: time to divide and rule?","abstract":"Therapeutic decisions for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) are largely based on histopathologic characteristics. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Choi and colleagues report three molecular subtypes of MIBC with the potential to guide prognosis, patient stratification, and treatment.
