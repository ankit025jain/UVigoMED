{"id":7735,"title":"Serum antibodies and DNA indicate a high prevalence of equine papillomavirus 2 (EcPV2) among horses in Switzerland.","abstract":"The DNA of equine papillomavirus type 2 (EcPV2) is consistently found in equine papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas, indicating a causal association of EcPV2 in the pathogenesis of these tumours; however, little is known about the prevalence of this virus.The aim of this study was to determine the geno- and seroprevalence of EcPV2 in clinically healthy horses in Switzerland.Fifty horses presented to the equine department of the university clinic, displaying no skin or mucous membrane lesions or severe signs of other diseases, were sampled.Cytobrush samples from the penis or vulva and serum samples were collected. To determine the genoprevalence of EcPV2, DNA was extracted from cytobrush samples and tested for viral DNA with a PCR assay amplifying a 338 bp fragment of the E7/E1 region of the viral genome. Seroprevalence was tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay aimed to detect antibodies against the major capsid protein (L1) of EcPV2.In five of 50 horses (10%), EcPV2-specific DNA was amplified but no antibodies could be detected, whereas in 14 of 50 horses (28%), antibodies against EcPV2 but no DNA were demonstrated. Both antibodies and viral DNA were detected in four of 50 horses (8%). Neither antibodies nor viral DNA were found in 27 of 50 horses (54%).The seroprevalence suggests that EcPV2 is prevalent in the Swiss equine population, while the genoprevalence indicates that currently ongoing infections are less common. The discrepancy between geno- and seroprevalence probably indicates different stages of infection in the tested cohort.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840327","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Vulva","weight":0.861098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulva"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.825797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.780863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.723534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.659372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.534383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.495686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.489455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.282271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.152612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Laryngeal papillomatosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_papillomatosis"},{"name":"Protein L","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_L"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Equus (genus)","weight":0.0126805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(genus)"}]}
