{"id":28858,"title":"Associations of fearful spells and panic attacks with incident anxiety, depressive, and substance use disorders: a 10-year prospective-longitudinal community study of adolescents and young adults.","abstract":"The concept of fearful spells (FS) denotes distressing spells of anxiety that might or might not qualify for criteria of panic attacks (PA). Few studies examined prospective-longitudinal associations of FS not meeting criteria for PA with the subsequent onset of mental disorders to clarify the role of FS as risk markers of psychopathology.A representative community sample of adolescents and young adults (N = 3021, age 14-24 at baseline) was prospectively followed up in up to 3 assessment waves over up to 10 years. FS, PA, anxiety, depressive, and substance use disorders were assessed using the DSM-IV/M-CIDI. Odds Ratios (OR) from logistic regressions were used to examine the predictive value of FS-only (no PA) and PA at baseline for incident disorders at follow-up.In logistic regressions adjusted for sex and age, FS-only predicted the onset of any subsequent disorder, any anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, GAD, social phobia, any depressive disorder, major depression, and dysthymia (ORs 1.54-4.36); PA predicted the onset of any anxiety disorder, panic disorder, GAD, social phobia, any depressive disorder, major depression, dysthymia, any substance use disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, and nicotine dependence (ORs 2.08-8.75; reference group: No FS-only and no PA). Associations with psychopathology were slightly smaller for FS-only than for PA, however, differences in associations (PA compared to FS-only) only reached significance for any anxiety disorder (OR = 3.26) and alcohol abuse/dependence (OR = 2.26).Findings suggest that compared to PA, FS-only have similar predictive properties regarding subsequent psychopathology and might be useful for an early identification of high-risk individuals.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced
