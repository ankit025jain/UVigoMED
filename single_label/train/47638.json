{"id":47638,"title":"[The clinical significance of hepatitis B virus large surface protein in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hepatitis B].","abstract":"To explore the sigificance of HBV-LP in the HBV replication and anti-virus treatment efficacy assessment by detect the serum HBV-LP and HBV DNA and Pre-S1 and HBV serum markers.Serum HBV-LP, Pre-S1 and HBV serologic markers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosobent assay(ELISA), fluorescent PCR method to detect serum HBV DNA content in the 220 cases infected serum of CHB. Treated with adefovir dipivoxil antiviral therapy, and mesured the setologic indicators after 12 weeks, 24 weeks,36 weeks and 48 weeks.The detection rate of HBV-LP and HBV DNA detection rate no significant difference in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and significantly higher than the Pre-S1 and HBeAg detection rate. HBV-LP positive rate also similar to the HBV DNA positive rate in HBeAg negative CHB patients. In the anti-virus therapy, the declined of HBV-LP similar to HBV DNA.HBV-LP can reflect the HBV replication, is a good chronic hepatitis B diagnosis and efficacy evaluation index.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579475","annotations":[{"name":"Adefovir","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adefovir"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.800817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.626571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.495769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.272072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.192779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Antivirus software","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
