{"id":65894,"title":"Do patients know their nerve-sparing status after radical prostatectomy?","abstract":"To determine patients' knowledge regarding their nerve-sparing status (NSS) after radical prostatectomy (RP) and what factors during their clinical treatment are associated with this.One hundred consecutive patients attending an erectile dysfunction clinic in Toronto, Canada, with a prior RP were surveyed from December 2010 to June 2011. Patients were questioned whether they had undergone a nerve-sparing procedure and, if so, whether it was unilateral or bilateral. Patients were assessed on both knowledge (known vs unknown) and accuracy (correct vs incorrect) regarding their NSS. Operative reports were used to determine the true NSS of each patient.Thirty-nine percent of patients had no knowledge of their NSS. Forty-five percent of patients were able to correctly identify their NSS, including only 19% of patients undergoing a non-nerve-sparing procedure. On univariate analysis, factors associated with patients correctly knowing their NSS were age, having a nerve-sparing strategy dictated in the preoperative clinic note, nerve sparing included in the surgical consent form, and type of nerve-sparing procedure performed. On multivariate analysis, planned nerve-sparing approach dictated in the preoperative note (odds ratio [OR], 4.86), nerve sparing included in surgical consent (OR, 3.76), time since surgery (OR, 0.99), and having a bilateral nerve-sparing procedure (OR, 5.91) were associated with correctly identifying one's NSS.After RP, a significant proportion of patients with erectile dysfunction have no knowledge of whether they underwent a nerve-sparing procedure. By discussing with patients the planned nerve-sparing technique preoperatively and counseling them on their NSS postoperatively, urologists may be able to improve on patient recollection of their NSS.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767524","annotations":[{"name":"Canada","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.507693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.493301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.355524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Toronto","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.180229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Erection","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Role-playing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"}]}
