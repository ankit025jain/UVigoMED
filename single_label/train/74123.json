{"id":74123,"title":"Adjuvant chemotherapy in older women with breast cancer: who and what?","abstract":"A 73-year-old woman has been diagnosed with a mammographically detected grade 3, 2.2-cm invasive ductal carcinoma that is sentinel lymph node negative, estrogen receptor positive (80%), progesterone receptor negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (0 by immunohistochemistry). A gene expression assay (Oncotype DX, Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) showed a recurrence score of 28. Except for well-controlled hypertension and some aches and pains in her hands and knees, she has no other major illnesses. Her medications include an antihypertensive, vitamin D, and calcium. She discontinued cigarette smoking 20 years ago and has an occasional glass of wine. She describes her health as good, is fully functional, drives, has had no falls, and provides the majority of care for her sick husband. Her blood pressure is 146/88, her body mass index is 29.7, and her physical examination is normal. She is aware of the benefits and risks of adjuvant endocrine therapy and has been referred to discuss the role of chemotherapy.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868030","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass
