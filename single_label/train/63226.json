{"id":63226,"title":"Evaluation of epidemiological factors in survival of patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes.","abstract":"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) prognosis is currently based solely on clinical parameters. The identification of additional factors associated with MDS outcome could be used to further improve the current scoring system such as the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). The present study evaluates the role of epidemiological markers as predictors of survival for 365 adult de novo MDS patients. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to estimate overall survival. Median follow-up time was 22 months. At the time of last follow-up, 271 patients (74.3 %) had died. For all MDS patients, medium-high lifetime occupational agrochemical exposure (HR 1.85, CI 1.19-2.89) remained as an independent predictor of MDS survival. Stratified analysis by gender showed that ? 25 pack-years smoked (HR 1.44, CI 1.001-2.09) and medium-high lifetime occupational agrochemical exposure (HR 1.84, CI 1.15-2.97) were independent predictors of MDS survival in men, but not in women. For MDS patients stratified by IPSS categories, ? 25 pack-years smoked (HR 1.75, CI 1.005-3.06) was an independent predictor for intermediate 1 IPSS risk group only, and medium-high lifetime occupational agrochemical exposure was associated with increased mortality (HR 4.36, CI 1.20-15.8) in the high IPSS risk group. Smoking and lifetime occupational agrochemical exposure may play a role in MDS survival. Incorporating relevant epidemiological markers with known clinical predictors of outcome may help physician stratify patients and customize treatment strategies to improve the outcome of MDS.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463789","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.430036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.257531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.240107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.21961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Smoking (cooking)","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.12245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0541379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Agrochemical","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrochemical"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0172936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"2015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Stratification (water)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_(water)"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
