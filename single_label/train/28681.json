{"id":28681,"title":"Is there any evidence of changes in patterns of concurrent drug use among young Australians 18-29 years between 2007 and 2010?","abstract":"A significant minority of Australians engage in concurrent drug use (using more than one drug in a given period). We examined clusters and correlates of concurrent drug use using the latest available nationally representative survey data on Australian young adults.3836 participants aged 18-29 years (mean age 24 years) from the 2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS).Clusters were distilled using latent class analysis of past year use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, inhalants, steroids, barbiturates, meth/amphetamines, heroin, methadone/buprenorphine, other opiates, painkillers and tranquillisers/sleeping pills.Concurrent drug use in this sample was best described using a 4-class solution. The majority (87.5%) of young adults predominantly used alcohol only (50.9%) or alcohol and tobacco (36.6%). 10.2% reported using alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and ecstasy, and 2.3% reported using an extensive range of drugs.Most drug use clusters were robust in their profile and stable in their prevalence, indicating little meaningful change at the population level from 2007. The targeting of alcohol and tobacco use remains a priority, but openness to experiencing diverse drug-related effects remains a significant concern for 12.5% of young people in this age group.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24813551","annotations":[{"name":"Ketamine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Heroin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin"},{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Hallucinogen","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen"},{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Barbiturate","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate"},{"name":"Opiate","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate"},{"name":"MDMA","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA"},{"name":"Inhalant abuse","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalant_abuse"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.584805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.322521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.316664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.311627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.213393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
