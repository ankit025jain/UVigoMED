{"id":40867,"title":"[Effects of amino acid infusion in preventing intraoperative hypothermia: comparison between sevoflurane versus propofol].","abstract":"Amino acid infusion was reported to be effective in preventing hypothermia during surgery. We investigated whether the antihypothermic effects of amino acid infusion depend on the anesthetic agent used for surgery.Patients underwent abdominal surgery lasting at least 2 hours under general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia Patients were divided into 4 groups depending on the anesthetic agents sevoflurane (S) or propofol (P) and on receiving amino acid infusion (A) or not (NA). Amino acid preparation 10% was infused for approximately 2 hours, starting when the patient entered the operating room. Pharyngeal temperature and palm temperature were measured every 5 minutes.Pharyngeal temperature was significantly higher (P < 0.001) at 60 minutes and later among patients receiving amino acid infusion in both SA and PA groups but did not differ between SA and PA groups. Palm temperature was also higher after amino acid infusion in the SA and PA, but was significantly higher in P as compared with S (A : P = 0.014; NA : P < 0.001).Core and peripheral temperatures increased after amino acid infusion in patients receiving sevoflurane or propofol. Our results suggest that the antihypothermic effects of amino acid infusion do not depend on the anesthetic used.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979850","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.831559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.736012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.714726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Sevoflurane","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevoflurane"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.560249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.259122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Abdominal surgery","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_surgery"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.130071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0840024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"60 Minutes","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"South Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia"},{"name":"Arecaceae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"}]}
