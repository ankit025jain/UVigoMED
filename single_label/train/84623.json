{"id":84623,"title":"[Microglial hypothesis of schizophrenia].","abstract":"While the etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear, there has been a growing amount of evidence pointing to neuroinflammation, which is characterized by an increased serum concentration of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase of microglia in the brain of schizophrenics. Microglia respond rapidly to even minor pathological changes in the brain and may contribute directly to neuronal degeneration by producing various pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radicals. In many aspects, the neuropathology of schizophrenia has recently been reported to be closely associated with microglial activation. Our \"Microglia Hypothesis of Schizophrenia\" may shed a new light on the therapeutic strategy for schizophrenia.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069267","annotations":[{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Neuropathology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.778832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Microglia","weight":0.711652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.636935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.197064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
