{"id":49252,"title":"Simplified noncultured autologous cell grafting for the treatment of chronic nonhealing ulcers: the six-well plate technique.","abstract":"Chronic recalcitrant ulcers are associated with severe morbidity, and there are few effective treatment options available. Living skin substitutes are an important form of adjuvant therapy to enhance healing of such wounds. We investigated a novel, simplified, noncultured, autologous, cell grafting procedure, using a six-well plate technique, to treat chronic recalcitrant wounds. This was a prospective pilot study that involved harvesting an ultrathin split-skin graft from the gluteal region, which was washed, separated and prepared in six different wells to obtain an autologous mixture of keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts; this was subsequently applied directly to the wound using a hyaluronic acid (HA) matrix. Eight patients with a total of 14 ulcers were recruited. The primary endpoint assessed was the percentage of re-epithelialization of the ulcers. Secondary endpoints included quality of life and wound bed indices. At baseline, the median wound surface area was 7.4 cm(2) (mean 17.6 ± 23.6 cm(2) , range 0.5-80.0 cm(2) ) with a median duration of 18 months (mean 70.2 ± 95.9, range 3-216 months). The median wound surface area was reduced by 74.3%, from 7.4-1.9 cm(2) , at the final visit. Overall, 28.3% of the ulcers achieved complete healing, and 71.3% of the ulcers had reduction in wound size. Post-graft, there was also improvement in secondary wound bed parameters and all quality of life domains of the Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule. These results suggest that this noncultured autologous six-well technique might be beneficial for treating recalcitrant ulcers.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Endocrine System
