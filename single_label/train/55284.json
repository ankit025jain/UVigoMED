{"id":55284,"title":"Pupil-expansion ring implantation through a 0.9 mm incision.","abstract":"Disposable square and hexagonal Bhattacharjee pupil-expansion rings are made of 5-0 nylon, have notches at the corners, and flanges at the sides in a single 0.1 mm thin plane. To insert the ring, a flange is held with a 23-gauge forceps and the ring is inserted through a 0.9 mm (20-gauge) or larger main- or side-port incision. Alternate flanges are tucked under the iris using a Kuglen hook. A 23-gauge forceps and an iris hook can also be used to tuck the flanges bimanually. The ring is removed by disengaging 2 notches and pulling it out of a 0.9 mm (20-gauge) incision. No snagging of the incision occurs at insertion or removal. No injector is required. The device is useful in standard coaxial phacoemulsification, femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery, biaxial microincision cataract surgery (MICS), coaxial sub-2.0 mm MICS, and small-pupil microincision vitreous surgery and in eyes with shallow anterior chambers.Dr. Bhattacharjee has a pending international patent application (PCT-WIPO) for the pupil-expansion devices.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928337","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.797888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Nylon","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.403118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.214973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.203316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.0423718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Flange","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flange"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Forceps","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forceps"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Coaxial cable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable"},{"name":"Fixed-wing aircraft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft"},{"name":"Hexagon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Birefringence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Injector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injector"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glossary of tennis terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_tennis_terms"},{"name":"Patent Cooperation Treaty","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty"},{"name":"Patent application","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_application"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bicameralism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism"},{"name":"Disposable","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable"},{"name":"International law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law"}]}
