{"id":81507,"title":"Chewing movements altered in the presence of temporomandibular joint internal derangements.","abstract":"The objectives were to find specific factors that are mathematically distinct between the chewing timings, movement pattern shapes, variability, and movement velocities of: (1) normal asymptomatic subjects and (2) a group of subjects with verified temporomandibular joint (TMJ) internal derangements.Left- and right-sided chewing movement recordings of 28 subjects (34.5 ± 14.0 years) were randomly selected from a large database of patients exhibiting verified unilateral or bilateral TMJ internal derangements. The chewing movements of an age- and gender-matched control group of 20 asymptomatic subjects (32.5 ± 11.6 years, P>0.60) with verified normal TMJ function were also recorded. Means and standard deviations of the opening, closing, turning point, terminal chewing position, and velocity patterns were calculated. A two-tailed Student's t-test with unequal variances was used to compare the parameters between the two groups (alpha?=?0.05).The dysfunctional group functioned significantly slower and with greater variability than the control group. The vertical dimension was consistently smaller in the dysfunctional group (P<0.00001). The terminal chewing position was significantly less precise in the dysfunctional group (vertical: P<0.002 and lateral: P<0.037). The maximum lateral width was significantly less (P<0.0071), and the peak and the average velocities were significantly lower (P<0.00001 for both) in the dysfunctional group.This group of dysfunctional subjects exhibited significantly slower, smaller, and more variable chewing patterns than the control group. The functional pattern of mastication appears to be significantly altered in the presence of an internal derangement of the TMJ.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000160","annotations":[{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.479186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.358563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.357917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.346898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.198058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.170898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0674748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Functional (mathematics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0299982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Left-wing politics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Derangement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Turning point of the American Civil War","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_point_of_the_American_Civil_War"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Timing (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_(music)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"}]}
