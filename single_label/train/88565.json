{"id":88565,"title":"The Montreal Cognitive Assessment in persons with traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to examine the performance of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The MoCA was administered to 214 patients with TBI during their acute care hospitalization in a Level 1 trauma center. The results showed that patients with severe TBI had lower scores on the MoCA compared with patients with mild and moderate TBI, F(2, 211) = 10.35, p = .0001. This difference was found for visuospatial/executive, attention, and orientation subtests (p < .05). Linear regression demonstrated that age, education, TBI severity, and the presence of neurological antecedents were the best predictors of cognitive impairments explaining 42% of the total variability of the MoCA. This information can enable clinicians to predict early cognitive impairments and plan cognitive rehabilitation earlier in the recovery process.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826506","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.723856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.527243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.438034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.421364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Montreal","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Recovery model","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_model"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Cognitive rehabilitation therapy","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_rehabilitation_therapy"},{"name":"Sexual orientation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Acute care","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_care"}]}
