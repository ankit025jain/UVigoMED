{"id":48775,"title":"[Trace elements storage peculiarities and metallothionein content in human thyroid gland under iodine deficiency euthyroid nodular goiter].","abstract":"Accumulation of iodine and copper in the node, paranodular and contralateral (not affected tissue by node) tissues of thyroid gland in relation to the level of metal-binding proteins, potential antioxidants and oxidative changes in tissue was investigated. To assess the severity of the pathological process the molecular markers of cytotoxicity were used. The reduction of total iodine (by 19.5%), increase of inorganic iodine fraction (by 82.4%) and total copper content (twice) in paranodular and nodular tissues compared with contrlateral part have been established. Excess of copper in goitrous-changes tissue was partially accumulated in the metallothioneins. The level of metal-binding form of metallothioneins and reserve of free thiols of these proteins was higher two-three times and lower content of reduced glutathione in node-affected tissue compared to the contralateral part. Signs of cytotoxicity among them: higher cathepsine D free activity (up to 84.6% and 134.4% in paranodular tissue and node respectively) and higher level of DNA strand breaks in the node (up to 22.6%) were observed. In paranodular tissue the range of indices variability compared with parenchyma of contralateral part is shorter than in the node. Thus, under low level of iodine organification and high copper level in goitrous-modified tissue of thyroid gland metallothionein may provide a partial compensatory effect on prooxidative processes.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25033560","annotations":[{"name":"Iodine deficiency","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency"},{"name":"Goitre","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.847389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.782119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Inorganic compound","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inorganic_compound"},{"name":"Trace element","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_element"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.734955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.725667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Metallothionein","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallothionein"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.357965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.176834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0988413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Euthyroid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyroid"},{"name":"Organification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organification"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
