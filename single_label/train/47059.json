{"id":47059,"title":"Five fractions of radiation therapy followed by 4 cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy as preoperative treatment for rectal cancer.","abstract":"Preoperative radiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy is a standard of care for cT3-4 rectal cancer. Studies incorporating additional cytotoxic agents demonstrate increased morbidity with little benefit. We evaluate a template that: (1) includes the benefits of preoperative radiation therapy on local response/control; (2) provides preoperative multidrug chemotherapy; and (3) avoids the morbidity of concurrent radiation therapy and multidrug chemotherapy.Patients with cT3-4, any N, any M rectal cancer were eligible. Patients were confirmed to be candidates for pelvic surgery, provided response was sufficient. Preoperative treatment was 5 fractions radiation therapy (25 Gy to involved mesorectum, 20 Gy to elective nodes), followed by 4 cycles of FOLFOX [5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin]. Extirpative surgery was performed 4 to 9 weeks after preoperative chemotherapy. Postoperative chemotherapy was at the discretion of the medical oncologist. The principal objectives were to achieve T stage downstaging (ypT < cT) and preoperative grade 3+ gastrointestinal morbidity equal to or better than that of historical controls.76 evaluable cases included 7 cT4 and 69 cT3; 59 (78%) cN+, and 7 cM1. Grade 3 preoperative GI morbidity occurred in 7 cases (9%) (no grade 4 or 5). Sphincter-preserving surgery was performed on 57 (75%) patients. At surgery, 53 patients (70%) had ypT0-2 residual disease, including 21 (28%) ypT0 and 19 (25%) ypT0N0 (complete response); 24 (32%) were ypN+. At 30 months, local control for all evaluable cases and freedom from disease for M0 evaluable cases were, respectively, 95% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 89%-100%) and 87% (95% CI: 76%-98%). Cases were subanalyzed by whether disease met requirements for the recently activated PROSPECT trial for intermediate-risk rectal cancer. Thirty-eight patients met PROSPECT eligibility and achieved 16 ypT0 (42%), 15 ypT0N0 (39%), and 33 ypT0-2 (87%).This regimen achieved response and morbidity rates that compare favorably with those of conventionally fractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606849","annotations":[{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"FOLFOX","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOLFOX"},{"name":"Folinic acid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folinic_acid"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.767949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.697051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.611938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.549876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.465191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.384048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.296396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.279702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.279407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0961829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0380153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
