{"id":28365,"title":"Quality of drug label information on QT interval prolongation.","abstract":"Information regarding QT-prolongation in the drug label may vary between products. This could lead to suboptimal risk minimization strategies.To systematically assess the variation in the extent and content of information on QT prolongation in the summary of product characteristics (SPC) of recently approved medicinal products.Drug labels of products centrally approved in Europe between 2006 and 2012 were screened. Of drugs including the term 'QT' in the SPC, the message on QT-prolongation ('no prolongation'/'unclear drug-QT association'/'possibly QT-prolongation'/'QT-prolongation') and the advice on cautionary measures pertaining to QT-prolongation in the label were examined, as well as their association.Of the 175 screened products, 44 contained information on QT in the SPC ('no QT-prolongation': 23%, 'unclear drug-QT association': 43%, 'possibly QT-prolongation': 16%, 'QT-prolongation': 18%). 62% contained advices to act with caution in patients with additional risk factors for QT-prolongation. Products that more likely to have QT-prolonging properties according to the SPC provided more information on QT-prolongation in the SPC ('no prolongation': 10% and for the category 'QT-prolongation': 100%).The extent and content of information on QT-prolongation varies considerably between SPCs, and in almost half of the drugs a clear message on QT-prolongation was lacking in the SPC.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902506","annotations":[{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.553996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Long QT syndrome","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.117544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Record label","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Q (New York City Subway service)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(New_York_City_Subway_service)"},{"name":"Statistical process control","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
