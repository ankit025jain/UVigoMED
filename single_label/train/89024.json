{"id":89024,"title":"Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis using a helical plate for metadiaphyseal complex fractures of the proximal humerus.","abstract":"Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) has been used for humeral shaft fractures, but concerns exist about soft tissue injuries. The purpose of this study was to report the surgical technique and clinical outcomes of MIPO using a helical plate for metadiaphyseal complex humeral shaft fractures. Twelve patients with acute displacement involving proximal and middle third humeral shaft fractures (AO type C) were treated using the MIPO technique with a helical plate. Fracture union, complications, and functional outcomes were evaluated using the Constant-Murley score and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) at final follow-up. All fractures united at an average of 17.9 weeks. No major complications, such as neurovascular injury, infection, and nonunion, were observed. Mean Constant-Murley and MEPS scores at final follow-up were 88.6 and 97.9, respectively. A MIPO technique using a helical plate can be a useful surgical option for metadiaphyseal complex fractures of the humeral shaft.
