{"id":63070,"title":"Hereditary gene mutations in Korean patients with isolated erythrocytosis.","abstract":"Most cases of erythrocytosis occur secondary to chronic tissue hypoxia or as a clonal disease such as polycythemia vera with somatic mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. Rarely, erythrocytosis is caused by hereditary gene mutations. This study investigated hereditary gene mutations in 38 unrelated Korean patients with isolated erythrocytosis without (1) JAK2 mutation and (2) secondary causes of erythrocytosis other than smoking history. Direct sequencing analyses were performed on six genes associated with hereditary erythrocytosis [HBB, exon 2 and exon 3 of HBA2, VHL, EGLN1 (previously PHD2), exon 12 of EPAS1 (previously HIF2A), and exons 5-8 of EPOR]. As a result, mutations were detected in five patients (three never smokers and two current smokers) out of 38 patients (13.2 %). The mutations detected in those five patients were EPOR:p.W439*, EPOR:p.G212C, HBB:p.H98Q (or conventionally H97Q, Hb Malmö [? 97(FG4) His > Gln]), HBB:p.V138M (V137M), and EGLN1:p.L279Tfs43*, all in heterozygous state. No patient had mutations in HBA2, VHL, or in EPAS1. This study indicates that workup for hereditary gene mutations is needed for isolated erythrocytosis with or without smoking history.
