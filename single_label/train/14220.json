{"id":14220,"title":"MiR-150 enhances the motility of EPCs in vitro and promotes EPCs homing and thrombus resolving in vivo.","abstract":"Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is one of the common peripheral vascular diseases. The recruitment and migration of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to the sites of venous thrombus are necessary in the process of thrombus organization and recanalization. Our objective was to investigate the functional role of miR-150 in rat EPCs and its potential application in deep venous thrombosis.Rat EPCs were cultured and transfected with miR-150 mimics and inhibitor. Wound healing assay, transwell migration assay and matrigel tube formation assay were performed to elucidate the effect of miR-150 of rat EPCs. Lentiviral construct expressing miR-150 was transfected into EPCs and the EPCs were injected to rat models of DVT. The rats were sacrificed on the day of 7 and 14 after the transplantation and the histological study was performed. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot were performed to evaluate rat miR-150 regulates the expression of c-Myb.MiR-150 significantly promoted the migration and tube formation ability of EPCs in vitro and enhanced EPCs' homing, organization and resolution ability in vivo. Overexpression of miR-150 significantly reduced the protein level of c-Myb and repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter containing both of the two predicted miR-150 binding sites in c-Myb 3'-UTR, indicating that c-Myb may be a miR-150 target gene.MiR-150 enhanced the migration, tube formation, homing, thrombus recanalization and resolution ability of rat EPCs. Restoring miR-150 in EPCs revealed potential application in DVT therapy.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438945","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.941928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.777315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.558725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.510532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.433051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.35878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.243347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.218895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.217779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Non-coding RNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
