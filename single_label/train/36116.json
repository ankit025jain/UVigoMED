{"id":36116,"title":"Repair of early left main stem stenosis after switch operation using an autologous innominate vein patch.","abstract":"We describe the repair of the postoperative left main stem stenosis of a 24-day old male patient who initially underwent arterial switch operation for dextro-transposition of the great arteries. The repair was facilitated by using an autologous left innominate vein patch, while there was a shortage of suitable repair material in this neonate. Postoperative echocardiogram prior to discharge confirmed a satisfactory flow through the left main stem and improved left ventricle function.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599839","annotations":[{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.833379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.69924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.499795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Great arteries","weight":0.41446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_arteries"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.39073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Brachiocephalic vein","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiocephalic_vein"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Jatene procedure","weight":0.201357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatene_procedure"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Transdermal patch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal_patch"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Main stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_stem"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Brachiocephalic artery","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiocephalic_artery"}]}
