{"id":90077,"title":"[Case-control study on percutaneous compressing plating and proximal femoral nail antirotation in treating in tertrochanteric fracture with risk external wall].","abstract":"To compare clinical effects between percutaneous compressing plating (PCCP) and proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) for the treatment of patients with intertrochanteric fracture with risk external wall.From September 2007 to June 2010, 43 patients with intertrochanteric fracture with risk external wall were treated by PCCP or PFNA according to different kinds of internal fixations. There were 22 cases in PCCP, including 9 males and 13 females with an average age of 68.4 (ranged, 60 to 86) years old, and 13 cases with type A2.2 and 9 cases with type A2.3; while 21 cases in PFNA, including 7 males and 14 females with an average age of 67.7 (ranged, 57 to 93) years old, and 10 cases with type A2.2 and 11 cases with type A2.3. Blood loss, operation time, hospital stay, fracture healing time, complications and Harris score after 1 years' following-up were observed and compared.All patients were followed up for 12 to 22 (means 18.4) months, and all patients were obtained fracture healing, and recovered walking ability as before injury. There were no significant differences in blood loss, operation time, hospital stay, fracture healing time, complications and Harris score after 1 years' following-up (P>0.05). One case occurred displacement on the top of greater trochanter, and 1 case injuried weakness of hip abduction. One case occurred screw breakage in PCCP, while 1 case occurred hip joint pain in PFNA.Both of PCCP and PFNA in treating patients with intertrochanteric fracture with risk external wall can receive good clinical effects, while the effects and therapy strategy for displacement of bone on the top of lateral wall should further study.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654510","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.812922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.795781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.75024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.7223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.702993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.630781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.544887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.505445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Greater trochanter","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_trochanter"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.292202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.285637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hip joint","weight":0.102975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_joint"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Perfluorononanoic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorononanoic_acid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data compression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Displacement (vector)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Fixation (visual)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(visual)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Membranous wall of tympanic cavity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membranous_wall_of_tympanic_cavity"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"}]}
