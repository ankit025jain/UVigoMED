{"id":62856,"title":"The rate of reduction in the maximum standardized uptake value from the initial to the post-R-CHOP therapy in positron emission tomography scan predicts disease progression in diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients.","abstract":"[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is useful for primary staging and evaluation of treatment outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. The reduction in the maximum standardized uptake value (?SUVmax) from the initial to the interim 18F-FDG PET scan has been reported to predict survival in DLBCL patients. We retrospectively evaluated ?SUVmax obtained by PET or PET-computed tomography before and after initial therapy in 31 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients who were treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) therapy. Receiver observation characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the optimal cutoff value for the ?SUVmax for disease progression. The 3-year progression-free survival rate of patients with ?SUVmax?83 and <83% was found to be 91 and 25%, respectively (P<0.001). The 4-year overall survival rate of patients with ?SUVmax?83 and <83% was found to be 100 and 83%, respectively (P=0.046). The ?SUVmax observed before and after R-CHOP therapy could be useful in the prediction of disease progression and survival in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504845","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.639307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.467783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.385158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.375442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.362773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.307243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.171955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
