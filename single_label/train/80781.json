{"id":80781,"title":"Targeting Plasmodium falciparum protein kinases with adenosine analogue-oligoarginine conjugates.","abstract":"During the last decade, a vast number of inhibitors, ligands and fluorescent probes have evolved for mammalian protein kinases; however, the suitability of these compounds for studies of evolutionarily divergent eukaryotes has mostly been left beyond the scope of research. Here, we examined whether adenosine analogue-oligoarginine conjugates that had been extensively characterized as efficient inhibitors of the human protein kinases are applicable for targeting Plasmodium protein kinases. We demonstrated that ARCs were not only able to bind to and inhibit a representative member of Plasmodium falciparum kinome (cGMP-dependent protein kinase) in biochemical assay, but also affected the general phosphorylation levels in parasites released from the infected red blood cells upon saponin treatment. These findings urge advantaging of already existing biochemical tools, whose initially generic, but intrinsically \"tunable\" selectivity profiles could be used for dissection of signaling pathways outside the initially defined group of biological targets.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534615","annotations":[{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.95826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Eukaryote","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.726962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.573986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.474321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.400503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.347037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.201356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Fluorophore","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"}]}
