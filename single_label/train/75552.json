{"id":75552,"title":"Population substructure in Cache County, Utah: the Cache County study.","abstract":"Population stratification is a key concern for genetic association analyses. In addition, extreme homogeneity of ethnic origins of a population can make it difficult to interpret how genetic associations in that population may translate into other populations. Here we have evaluated the genetic substructure of samples from the Cache County study relative to the HapMap Reference populations and data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).Our findings show that the Cache County study is similar in ethnic diversity to the self-reported \"Whites\" in the ADNI sample and less homogenous than the HapMap CEU population.We conclude that the Cache County study is genetically representative of the general European American population in the USA and is an appropriate population for conducting broadly applicable genetic studies.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078123","annotations":[{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"European American","weight":0.746724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_American"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.674607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Utah","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.492836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.486839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.421094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.401427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.359427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.279711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"International HapMap Project","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_HapMap_Project"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"Cache County, Utah","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_County,_Utah"},{"name":"Population stratification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_stratification"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Karl Marx","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
