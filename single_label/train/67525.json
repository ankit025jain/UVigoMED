{"id":67525,"title":"Membrane androgen receptor sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger activity in prostate cancer cells.","abstract":"Membrane androgen receptors (mAR) are expressed in several tumors. mAR activation by testosterone albumin conjugates (TAC) suppresses tumor growth and migration. mAR signaling involves phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). PI3K stimulates serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1, which in turn activates Na(+)/H(+)-exchangers (NHE). In prostate cancer cells cytosolic pH (pHi) was determined utilizing 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein-fluorescence and NHE-activity utilizing Na(+)-dependent cytosolic realkalinization following an ammonium pulse. TAC (100 nM) significantly increased pHi and NHE-activity, effects abrogated by NHE1-inhibitor cariporide (10 ?M), SGK1-inhibitors EMD638683 (50 ?M) and GSK650349 (10 ?M) and ROCK-inhibitors Y-27632 (10 ?M) and fasudil (100 ?M). TAC treatment rapidly and significantly increased cell volume and actin polymerization, effects abolished in the presence of cariporide. Thus, mAR-activation activates cariporide-sensitive Na(+)/H(+)-exchangers, an effect requiring SGK1 and ROCK activity.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607544","annotations":[{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.798359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.780709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Inositol trisphosphate","weight":0.761851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_trisphosphate"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.7558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.741133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.700863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.696561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Polymerization","weight":0.617609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.565672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Ammonium","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium"},{"name":"GlaxoSmithKline","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Arp2/3 complex","weight":0.0297666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arp2/3_complex"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
