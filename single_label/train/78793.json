{"id":78793,"title":"The role of secondhand smoke in sinusitis: a systematic review.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to systematically review existing literature on the association between sinusitis and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure.We performed a literature search encompassing the last 25 years in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Inclusion criteria included English language papers containing original human data with at least 7 subjects. Data was systematically collected on study design, patient demographics, clinical characteristics/outcomes, and level-of-evidence (Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine). Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Two investigators independently reviewed all manuscripts.The initial search yielded 116 abstracts, of which 19 articles were included. Thirteen (68.4%) of the 19 articles showed a statistically significant association between sinusitis and SHS. Seven (36.8%) studies specifically evaluated chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with 5 (71.4%) CRS studies demonstrating a significant association between CRS and SHS. Seventeen articles were case-control studies (Level 3b). For characterizing sinusitis, 6 (31.6%) studies included computed tomography (CT) or endoscopy in the diagnostic criteria, with 5 of these studies following rhinosinusitis taskforce guidelines. For determining presence of SHS, all studies used questionnaires and 2 (10.5%) studies also reported serum or urine cotinine levels.A majority of the studies (68.4%) included in this systematic review showed a significant association between sinusitis and SHS. Furthermore, 5 (83.3%) of the 6 studies with objective diagnostic criteria (CT, endoscopy) found a significant association between sinusitis and SHS. Further higher-quality studies with objective diagnosis of sinusitis and quantification of SHS exposure should be performed in the future to better evaluate the relationship between sinusitis and SHS.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574074","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.811833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Passive smoking","weight":0.650484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.602278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.507968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.461308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.417578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.366061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.296487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.254468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"},{"name":"Oxford","weight":0.114958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.104308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Abstract (summary)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
