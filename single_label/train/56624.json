{"id":56624,"title":"Emesis-induced sub-periosteal haematoma: a case report.","abstract":"Orbital sub-periosteal haematoma (OSH) is usually caused by orbital trauma. We present a case of spontaneous OSH and review the literature on this condition.We present a case of sub-periosteal haematoma secondary to migraine and vigorous emesis.OSH is very rare; this case highlights the clinical features of the condition and that rapid spontaneous resolution can occur. We review the literature on emesis- or valsava-induced OSH and discuss possible mechanisms for its formation in conjunction with migraine.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660981","annotations":[{"name":"Migraine","weight":0.209541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Optical resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution"},{"name":"Chiral resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_resolution"},{"name":"Department of Labour (New Zealand)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Labour_(New_Zealand)"},{"name":"Orbital (band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_(band)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"}]}
