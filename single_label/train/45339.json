{"id":45339,"title":"Safety of a dual potential prebiotic system from Mexican agave \"Metlin® and Metlos®\", incorporated to an infant formula for term newborn babies: a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"Infant formulae are being supplemented with probiotics, prebiotics, or symbiotic despite uncertainties regarding their efficacy. Mexican agave is an interesting source of fructans with particular features and with potential prebiotic effects.RCT in 600 healthy term babies (20 ± 7 days), allocated to receive standard infant formula (control) or infant formula added with a dual prebiotic system \"Metlin® and Metlos®\", from Mexican agave. Primary outcomes include stools frequency, stools consistency, gastrointestinal intolerance (frequency of abdominal distension, flatulency, regurgitations, vomiting). Secondary outcomes include changes on weight and height along the study and frequency of dermatologic problems (eczema).In 66,120 days of total follow-up, there were no differences on the frequency of stools passage (Human Milk: 3.8 ± 2.4 evacuations per day; Pro + Metlin + Metlos 3.6 ± 2.0; Pro + Metlin 3.6 ± 2; only Pro 3.4 ± 2.3¸ only formula 3.4 ± 2.0; p NS). Consistency of stools was similar between human milk and prebiotics supplemented groups. Also the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms was significantly low between these groups.Fructans derivate from agave and added to infant formula are safe and well tolerated by Mexican healthy term babies.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687355","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.875198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Symbiosis","weight":0.714275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Infant formula","weight":0.591282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula"},{"name":"Human breast milk","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_breast_milk"},{"name":"Prebiotic (nutrition)","weight":0.575323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebiotic_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.376491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.276889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.20421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Food intolerance","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_intolerance"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Gregorian calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
