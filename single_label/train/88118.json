{"id":88118,"title":"Body composition changes after 12 months of FES cycling: case report of a 60-year-old female with paraplegia.","abstract":"Single-subject (female, 60 years of age) case.The purpose of this case report is to document body composition changes in a 60-year-old female with chronic paraplegia after 12 months of home-based functional electrical stimulation lower extremities cycling (FES-LEC).Home-based FES-LEC with internet connection. Southeastern United States.FES-LEC three sessions per week for 12 months in participant's home and monitored by the research staff via internet connection. Pre- and post-exercise program testing for body composition including percent body fat, fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM) and whole-body bone mineral density (BMD) via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).There was a 7.7% increase in total body LM and a 4.1% increase in legs LM. There was a 1.2% decrease in total body FM and a 9.9% decrease in legs FM. Percent body fat decreased from 48.4 to 46.3 and whole-body BMD was increased from 0.934 to 1.023, which resulted in an improvement in the DXA T-score from -2.4 to -1.3.Positive body compositional changes during this study support the idea that long-term FES-LEC can help restore healthier ratios of LM and FM and possibly decrease the risk of associated diseases. Increased whole-body BMD provides hope that long-term FES-LEC may be beneficial regarding bone health.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902644","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.696422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry","weight":0.594113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.442177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.379329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Paraplegia","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Cycling","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional electrical stimulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation"},{"name":"FM broadcasting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"934","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/934"},{"name":"Apollo Lunar Module","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Feline sarcoma oncogene","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_sarcoma_oncogene"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Internet access","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access"},{"name":"Student loan","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loan"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"List of highest playoff series scoring averages in National Basketball Association history","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_playoff_series_scoring_averages_in_National_Basketball_Association_history"}]}
