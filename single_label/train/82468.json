{"id":82468,"title":"[Impacts on the curative effect of peripheral facial paralysis treated with acupuncture and moxibustion at different times].","abstract":"To explore the optimal intervention time of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of peripheral facial paralysis.Two hundred and four cases of peripheral facial paralysis were collected in clinic for retrospective analysis. According to the time between the disease onset and the intervention of acupuncture and moxibustion, 3 groups (groups A, B and C) were divided. In group A, the treatment was given in 1 to 3 days after onset; in group B, the treatment was given in 4 to 7 days after onset; in group C the treatment was given in 8 to 10 days after onset. The treatment with acupuncture and moxibustion was applied according to the regular stages of disease in the three groups. At the acute stage, the less points and shallow puncture therapy combined with distal acupoints at the limbs were adopted on the affected side. At the stable stage, the more points and shallow puncture therapy were used on the affected side. At the recovery stage, the deep puncture or penetrating punctures was applied on the affected side. The curative effects was given once every day and the treatment of 10 days made one session. The curative effects were analyzed statistically at the end of three sessions of treatments separately.At the end of the 1st session of treatment, the total effective rate was 58.8% (40/68) in group A, 69.7% (53/76) in group B and 46.6% (28/60) in group C. At the end of the 2nd session of treatment, the total effective rate was 85.3% (58/68), 90.8% (69/76) and 71.6% (43/60) in group A, B and C separately. At the end of 3rd session of treatment, the total effective rates were 89.7% (61/68), 97.4% (74/76) and 83.3% (50/60) in the three groups separately. The differences were significant statistically at the same session of treatment among three groups (all P<0.05), in which, the results in group B was the best, followed by group A and C in sequence.the best intervention time of acupuncture and moxibustion is in 4 to 7 days after onset of facial paralysis.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617233","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.395399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.354927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.245321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0433842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.0172936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Rmdir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rmdir"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Nd (digraph)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nd_(digraph)"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"}]}
