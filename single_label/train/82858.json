{"id":82858,"title":"Evaluation of student perception of the lecture \"oral functional medical rehabilitation: balneophysiotherapy\".","abstract":"Th aim of the study was to assess this course as perceived by the 6th year dentistry students.Applying and validating the \"Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM)\" for the first time in Romania.The reliability of the test according to Cronbach alpha method, which measures the internal consistency of a test, was 0.87 (Cronbach alpha coefficient should be above 0.70). As to the reliability coefficients (internal consistency) for each test subscale and for the entire test, DREEM proved a very good overall reliability, with alpha = 0.89. The reliability of each DREEM subscale was also analyzed. The DREEM test results, with a global score of 149, indicate a \"more positive than negative\" perception (score between 101 and 150).The DREEM test showed that the assessment and treatment of pain in dental-maxillary pathology and TMJ dysfunctions through medical rehabilitation by means of balneophysiotherapy is of interest to final year dental medicine students. As a student-teacher partnership, modern education cannot ignore the practical needs of students and should add to their theoretical training with courses and practical training programs necessary in their future profession.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502064","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.761989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.74505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.447438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.323723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.317072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Lecture","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecture"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Dundee","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"}]}
