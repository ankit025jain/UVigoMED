{"id":90530,"title":"[Work-related musculoskeletal trauma].","abstract":"The number of labor accident casualties between 2003 and 2012 has ranged from 110,000 to 130,000 per year in Japan. Japan Advanced Trauma Evaluation and Care (JATEC) program was established for major trauma and has been developed in emergency rooms. Surgical intervention to fractures in extremities includes various methods such as internal fixation with plates and screws including locking compression plate system, interlocking nailing system and external fixation. Definitive treatment for spinal cord injury is still unsolved. Cell transplantation therapy using iPS cells is anticipated to be applied clinically. Some problems still remain in the certification criteria for residual disabilities caused by labor accidents. The criteria should be revised at some early date.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605521","annotations":[{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.734457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.669549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.666623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.635604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.599018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.476621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.414288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.237111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.230914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.17987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Interlocking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlocking"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Induced pluripotent stem cell","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"}]}
