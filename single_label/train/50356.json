{"id":50356,"title":"Management of peripheral arterial disease and the diabetic foot.","abstract":"The management of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is complex and there is a lack of robust evidence to guide definitive treatment strategies. Due to the distinct differences in etiology, disease distribution and treatment outcomes patients with diabetes, PAD and foot ulceration should be considered separately from those without diabetes. There is no randomized trial data to compare angioplasty and surgical bypass for revascularization in patients with DFU and PAD and the decision of whether, and how, to revascularize should be taken by experienced surgeons, in a multidisciplinary setting. Revascularization is only part of a treatment regimen which includes aggressive management of infection, neuropathy, foot deformity and cardiovascular risk. The burden and challenge of DFU in the context of PAD is continuing to increase and new research studies should be targeted specifically towards this ever-expanding group of patients.
