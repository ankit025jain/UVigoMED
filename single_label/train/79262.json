Significant difference was found in patients with/without MTP, and difference was also found in every type of MTP.MTP lies in most patients with vocal nodules while only part of patients with vocal fold polyps, which indicated that vocal fold polyps and vocal nodules may demonstrate different phona","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459931","annotations":[{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.801314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.36926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.239976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Phonation","weight":0.230556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonation"},{"name":"Vocal fold nodule","weight":0.113184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_fold_nodule"},{"name":"Music video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"}]}
