{"id":39690,"title":"Irritable bowel syndrome in Croatia.","abstract":"There are three epidemiological studies of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that were conducted in Croatia (in the area of Zagreb in 2002, Bjelovarsko-bilogorska County in 2008, and finally in Osjecko-baranjska County in 2011). The aim of this study is to analyze the anthropometric, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of IBS in Croatia comparing these three studies. The studies included a questionnaire based on Rome criteria. Study population matched the adult population of Croatia according last available census (1991, 2001 resp.). Studies showed a high prevalence of IBS and some common factors relevant for development of IBS were determined such as gender, body mass index and lower level of education. There is a need for further investigations in coastal Croatia applying a uniform questionnaire on anthropometric, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of IBS and Rome III criteria, diagnostic questionnaires and scoring algorithm for functional gastrointestinal disorders developed by Rome Foundation applicable in clinical practice and population studies, regarding the significant high prevalence of IBS in our country.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144989","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.818024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.632881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.615614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.508002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.462025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.447351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.428812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Croatia","weight":0.377325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.372936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.287629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Zagreb","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.135792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0370813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Rome process","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_process"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Coast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"1991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Functional gastrointestinal disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_gastrointestinal_disorder"},{"name":"Digestive disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_disease"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
