{"id":3515,"title":"Microdissection testicular sperm extraction in men with Sertoli cell-only testicular histology.","abstract":"To study the outcomes of microdissection testicular sperm extraction (microTESE) among men with pure Sertoli cell-only histology on diagnostic testicular biopsy.Retrospective cohort study.Tertiary referral center.Six hundred forty patients with pure Sertoli cell-only histology on testicular biopsy who underwent microTESE by a single surgeon.MicroTESE.Sperm retrieval rates.Overall, 44.5% of patients with Sertoli cell only had sperm retrieved with microTESE. No difference was noted in sperm retrieval rates based on testis volume (?15 mL vs. <15 mL, 35.3% vs. 46.1%, respectively). Patients with ?15 mL testicular volume and FSH 10-15 mU/mL had the worst prognosis, with a sperm retrieval rate of 6.7%.Patients with previous testicular biopsy demonstrating Sertoli cell-only histology can be counseled that they have a reasonable likelihood of sperm retrieval with the contemporary delivery of microTESE. Given this finding, the utility of testicular biopsy before microTESE is further questioned.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25441063","annotations":[{"name":"Sertoli cell","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertoli_cell"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.859089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Testicular sperm extraction","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_sperm_extraction"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.641684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.240293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"1015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1015"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Milliliter","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliliter"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Semen collection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_collection"}]}
