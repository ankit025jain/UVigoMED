{"id":88008,"title":"Examining 'risks' of overspecifying TMVs.","abstract":"Dr. Tom Makin, a highly experienced microbiologist and former Directorate manager at the Department of Medical Microbiology at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, and Ken Tench, compliance manager, Estates and Facilities Directorate, at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, who has worked in operational estate functions since 1984, examine the widespread use of thermostatic mixing valves, or TMVs, in healthcare premises. They argue that such devices have, in recent years especially, been overspecified, particularly given the potential for increased contamination of the outlets, and the resulting heightened risk of spread of potentially life-threatening nosocomial waterborne diseases.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930184","annotations":[{"name":"University of Liverpool","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Liverpool"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"University of Manchester","weight":0.647868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester"},{"name":"Manchester","weight":0.641097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester"},{"name":"Royal Liverpool University Hospital","weight":0.602659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Liverpool_University_Hospital"},{"name":"Liverpool","weight":0.581639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.568416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.472268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"NHS foundation trust","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_foundation_trust"},{"name":"Manchester Royal Infirmary","weight":0.211979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Royal_Infirmary"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Microbiologist","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiologist"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Waterborne diseases","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterborne_diseases"},{"name":"Medical microbiology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_microbiology"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"1984","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"University Hospitals of Cleveland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Hospitals_of_Cleveland"},{"name":"Regulatory compliance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance"},{"name":"Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Liverpool_Golf_Club,_Hoylake"},{"name":"Tench","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tench"},{"name":"Directorate of Ukraine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Ukraine"},{"name":"Makin (islands)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makin_(islands)"},{"name":"Thermostatic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostatic"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Trust law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law"},{"name":"Ferry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry"},{"name":"Poppet valve","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppet_valve"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Estates of the realm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm"},{"name":"Estate (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_(law)"}]}
