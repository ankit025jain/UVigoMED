{"id":47051,"title":"Monitoring fibrogenic progression in the liver.","abstract":"The clinical course of chronic liver diseases is significantly dependent on the progression rate of fibrosis which is the unstructured replacement of injured parenchyma by extracellular matrix. Despite intensive studies, the clinical opportunities for patients with fibrosing liver diseases have not improved. This will be changed by increasing knowledge of new pathogenetic mechanisms, which complement the \"canonical principle\" of fibrogenesis. The latter is based on the activation of hepatic stellate cells and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts induced by hepatocellular injury and consecutive inflammatory mediators such as TGF-?. Stellate cells express a broad spectrum of matrix components. New mechanisms indicate that the heterogeneous pool of (myo-)fibroblasts can be supplemented by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from cholangiocytes and potentially also from hepatocytes to fibroblasts, by influx of bone marrow-derived fibrocytes in the damaged liver tissue and by differentiation of a subgroup of monocytes to fibroblasts after homing in the damaged tissue. These processes are regulated by the cytokines TGF-? and BMP-7, chemokines, colony-stimulating factors, metalloproteinases and numerous trapping proteins. They offer innovative diagnostic and therapeutic options. As an example, modulation of TGF-?/BMP-7 ratio changes the rate of EMT, and so the simultaneous determination of these parameters and of the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in serum might provide information on fibrogenic activity. Also, proteomic and glycomic approaches of serum are under investigation to set up specific protein profiles in patients with liver fibrosis. The aim of this article is to present the current pathogenetic concepts of liver fibrosis and to discuss established and novel diagnostic approaches to reflect the process of hepatic fibrogenesis in the medical laboratory.
