{"id":90751,"title":"Early experience with the proximal femoral locking plate.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the failure rate of proximal femoral locking plates after an initial 2 years of use at a Level I trauma center. This retrospective chart review included 13 patients with intertrochanteric or peritrochanteric femoral fractures who underwent open reduction and internal fixation. Average patient age was 47 years (range, 23-80 years); average follow-up was 12.7 months (range, 2 weeks to 23 months). Three (23%) patients experienced catastrophic failure of the implant. The overall revision rate was 46% (6 of 13). One patient experienced avascular necrosis and required a planned total hip arthroplasty. In the appropriate setting, the proximal femoral locking plate can offer stable fixation for fractures involving the proximal femur; however, this series highlights the difficulties associated with treating these injuries, especially in patients with multiple injuries. Care must be taken to avoid varus malalignment and to address metabolic bone dysfunction.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579219","annotations":[{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.864089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.80489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.744529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.737441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Varus deformity","weight":0.265522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varus_deformity"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.265507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Level I trauma center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_I_trauma_center"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.0276285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Catastrophic failure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_failure"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
