{"id":22507,"title":"Excessive external drainage of CSF might aggravate bacterial ventriculitis.","abstract":"Bacterial ventriculitis is one of the most difficult diseases of neurosurgery, if not controlled well in the early stage, it will cause empyema, adhesion and separated infectious ventricle locules inside the ventricle. Few studies focus on the relationship between external drainage volume and the occurrence of adhesion and separation of the ventricle. This paper reported a case of ventriculitis, and we propose that excessive external drainage might increase the occurrence rate of the internal separation and adhesion of ventricle in patients with ventriculitis. Choosing an appropriate drainage method and avoiding excessive drainage might be the key to the treatment of ventriculitis.
