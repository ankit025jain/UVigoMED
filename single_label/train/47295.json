{"id":47295,"title":"Improving colorectal cancer screening in Asian Americans: Results of a randomized intervention study.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to use a randomized controlled trial design to test the impact of an educational intervention delivered by specially trained community health workers among Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese participants ages 50 to 75 years on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and intentions regarding colorectal cancer screening.Baseline data were collected on participants' demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs about cancer, its risk factors, and intention to keep up to date on cancer screening in the future. Fifteen intervention sessions were held between April and June of 2011. Follow-up surveys were administered in the postintervention period to both intervention and control participants. Those randomized to the control group received educational pamphlets in their native language.The intervention had the greatest influence on the Chinese subgroup, which had improved scores relative to the control group for perceived behavior control and intentions (preintervention vs postintervention change: control group, -0.16; intervention group, 0.11; P = .004), behavioral beliefs on cancer screening (preintervention vs postintervention change: control group, -0.06; intervention group, 0.24; P = .0001), and attitudes toward behavior (preintervention vs postintervention change: control group, -0.24; intervention group, 0.35; P ? .0001). The intervention had no effect on behavioral beliefs about cancer, control beliefs, or perceived behavioral control (reliance on family). Although the intention to stay up to date for cancer screening increased in 2 study groups (Chinese and Vietnamese), these increases were not significant.An educational program delivered by culturally specific community health educators using culturally appropriate language influences some knowledge, attitude, and behavioral beliefs but not others.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive
