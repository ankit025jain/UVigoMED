{"id":66753,"title":"Improvement of albuminuria after renal denervation.","abstract":"The primary objective of this study was the effect of renal denervation (RDN) on elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. In addition, patients were stratified according their UACR at baseline into micro- (30-300 mg/g, n=37) and macroalbuminuria (? 300 mg/g, <2,200 mg/g, n=22).Increased albuminuria indicates cardiovascular and renal damage in hypertension. RDN emerged as an innovative interventional approach to reduce blood pressure (BP) and may thus reduce albumin urinary excretion.Fifty-nine treatment-resistant hypertensive patients with elevated UACR at baseline underwent catheter-based RDN using the Symplicity Flexâ„¢ catheter (Medtronic Inc., Santa Rosa, CA).In the whole and pre-specified subgroups both office and 24-h ambulatory BP were significantly reduced 6 months after RDN. In parallel, a significant reduction in UACR occurred in all patients (160 (65-496) versus 89 (29-319) mg/g creatinine, p<0.001) and in both subgroups (microalbuminuria: 83 (49-153) versus 58 (17-113) mg/g creatinine, p=0.001; macroalbuminuria: (536 (434-1483) versus 478 (109-1080) mg/g creatinine, p<0.001). In accordance, the prevalence of micro- and macroalbuminuria decreased significantly. Regression analysis revealed a modest positive relationship between the decrease of UACR and the fall of systolic BP (?=0.340, p=0.039) independent of renal function. Renal function remained unchanged after RDN.In summary, following RDN, the magnitude of albuminuria as well as the prevalence of micro- and macroalbuminuria decreased in treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. Since albuminuria is an independent renal and cardiovascular risk factor, our findings suggest a reduction of renal and cardiovascular risk in these patients.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681017","annotations":[{"name":"Microalbuminuria","weight":0.88388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microalbuminuria"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.847526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.741577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.65239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.361972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Medtronic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medtronic"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_thoracic_sympathectomy"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"}]}
