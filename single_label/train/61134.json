{"id":61134,"title":"Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in an elderly patient.","abstract":"Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) of the elderly is a newly described lymphoproliferative disorder that arises in elderly patients without a predisposing immunodeficiency. Clinical features at presentation may include lymphadenopathy, B-symptoms and extranodal involvement. The main sites of extranodal involvement are the skin, lung, tonsil and stomach. Histopathological findings include atypical large lymphoid cells with variable amounts of reactive cells, such as small lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes. The neoplastic cells are positive for CD20, and in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA is positive in the majority of neoplastic cells. We present a new case of EBV-positive DLBCL in an 85-year-old man, who presented to our clinic with a 2-month history of asymptomatic cutaneous lesions involving his face and scalp.
