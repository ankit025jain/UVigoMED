{"id":69534,"title":"[Clinical and urodynamic evaluation of efficacy of conservative treatment of urination disorders in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia].","abstract":"17 patients (mean age, 61 +/- 1.7 years) with an benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and urination disorders were under observation. After examination by ultrasound, urodynamic and laboratory studies, patients received conservative combined therapy, including alpha1-adrenoblocker silodosin, L-carnitine, B vitamins and picamilon. As a result of the 4,5-month treatment, most of the symptoms were eliminated as evidenced by the decrease in IPSS score from 17 to 3; urodynamic parameters have improved that was recorded by the home uroflowmetry. It was concluded that the use of proposed combined therapy in patients with BPH as the first stage of treatment, followed by the administration of 5alpha-reductase inhibitors or performing surgical correction in case of formation of bladder outlet obstruction is justified.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437242","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Silodosin","weight":0.583062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silodosin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.395769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.188079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Picamilon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picamilon"},{"name":"Urodynamic testing","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodynamic_testing"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
