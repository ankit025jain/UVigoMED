{"id":37013,"title":"Defining the phenotype and diagnostic considerations in adults with congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation.","abstract":"Congenital disorders of N-glycosylation (CDG) form a rapidly growing group of more than 20 inborn errors of metabolism. Most patients are identified at the pediatric age with multisystem disease. There is no systematic review on the long-term outcome and clinical presentation in adult patients. Here, we review the adult phenotype in 78 CDG patients diagnosed with 18 different forms of N-glycosylation defects. Characteristics include intellectual disability, speech disorder and abnormal gait. After puberty, symptoms might remain non-progressive and patients may lead a socially functional life. Thrombosis and progressive symptoms, such as peripheral neuropathy, scoliosis and visual demise are specifically common in PMM2-CDG. Especially in adult patients, diagnostic glycosylation screening can be mildly abnormal or near-normal, hampering diagnosis. Features of adult CDG patients significantly differ from the pediatric phenotype. Non-syndromal intellectual disability, or congenital malformations in different types of CDG and decreasing sensitivity of screening might be responsible for the CDG cases remaining undiagnosed until adulthood.
