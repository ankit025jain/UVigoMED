{"id":74061,"title":"Proteoglycans, key regulators of cell-matrix dynamics.","abstract":"In this special issue of Matrix Biology centered on proteoglycan biology we have assembled a blend of articles focused on the state-of-the-art of proteoglycanology. The field has greatly expanded in the past three decades and now encompasses all the areas of biology. This special issue is divided into five chapters describing hyaluronan metabolism, biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of proteoglycans and their roles in inflammation, cancer, repair and development. We hope that the new original work and the reviews from recognized leaders will stimulate investigations in this exciting and fertile field of research.
