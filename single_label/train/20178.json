{"id":20178,"title":"Bariatric surgery prior to total joint arthroplasty may not provide dramatic improvements in post-arthroplasty surgical outcomes.","abstract":"This study compared the total joint arthroplasty (TJA) surgical outcomes of patients who had bariatric surgery prior to TJA to TJA patients who were candidates but did not have bariatric surgery. Patients were retrospectively grouped into: Group 1 (n = 69), those with bariatric surgery >2 years prior to TJA, Group 2 (n = 102), those with surgery within 2 years of TJA, and Group 3 (n = 11,032), those without bariatric surgery. In Group 1, 2.9% (95% CI 0.0-6.9%) had complications within 1 year compared to 5.9% (95% CI 1.3%-10.4%) in Group 2, and 4.1% (95% CI 3.8%-4.5%) in Group 3. Ninety-day readmission (7.2%, 95% CI 1.1%-13.4%) and revision density (3.4/100 years of observation) was highest in Group 1. Bariatric surgery prior to TJA may not provide dramatic improvements in post-operative TJA surgical outcomes.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674730","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.337602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"International Air Transport Association airport code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
