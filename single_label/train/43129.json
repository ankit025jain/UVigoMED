{"id":43129,"title":"Downregulation of galectin-3 causes a decrease in uPAR levels and inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.","abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a multifunctional ?-galactoside-binding protein, is highly expressed and associated with the prognosis of HCC. However, the functions of Gal-3 in HCC cells are not fully understood. To address the function of Gal-3 in HCC cells, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down Gal-3 expression in HepG2, an HCC cell line. We found that in vitro the silencing of Gal-3 decreased the proliferative activity, colony formation ability, migratory and invasive potential of HepG2 cells. The silencing of Gal-3 significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) as well as uPAR's downstream signaling transduction pathway, including phosphorylation of AKT. Furthermore, the downregulation of Gal-3 by siRNA resulted in significantly decreased activity of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and the treatment of HepG2 cells with MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 significantly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of uPAR. Taken together, our results suggest that Gal-3 modulates uPAR expression via the MEK/ERK pathway, and that Gal-3 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807674","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.802668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.770158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.682202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.584906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.566133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.392691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.352562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Galactose","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose"},{"name":"Urokinase receptor","weight":0.214973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urokinase_receptor"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.188448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.161574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Hep G2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep_G2"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
