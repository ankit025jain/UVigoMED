{"id":43108,"title":"In silico analysis of expression pattern of a Wnt/?-catenin responsive gene ANLN in gastric cancer.","abstract":"Actin-binding protein anillin (ANLN) is primarily involved in the cytokinesis and known to be dysregulated in many cancers including gastric cancer (GC). However, the regulation and clinical significance of ANLN in GC are far less clear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance and possible regulators of ANLN in GC. We have identified the Wnt/?-catenin associated regulation of ANLN by analyzing the in vitro perturbed ?-catenin mRNA expression profiles. Investigating the gastric tumors from publicly available genome-wide mRNA expression profiles, we have identified the over expression of ANLN in gastric tumors. Association between ANLN expression and clinical characteristics of GC showed elevated expression in intestinal type GC. Performing a single sample prediction method across GC mRNA expression profiles, we have identified the over expression of ANLN in proliferative type gastric tumors compared to the invasive and metabolic type gastric tumors. In silico pathway prediction analysis revealed the association between Wnt/?-catenin signaling and ANLN expression in gastric tumors. Our results highlight that expression of a Wnt/?-catenin responsive gene ANLN in GC is a molecular predictor of intestinal and proliferative type gastric tumors.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809965","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokinesis","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokinesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.703719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.56214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"In silico","weight":0.309824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
