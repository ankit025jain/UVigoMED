{"id":54275,"title":"Elevated peripheral frequencies of Th22 cells: a novel potent participant in obesity and type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Chronic low-grade inflammation has long been recognized as the central link between obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The novel subset of T helper (Th) cells, Th22, plays an emerging role in chronic inflammation. We investigated the potential association between Th22 and the pathogenesis of obesity and T2D.Ninety T2D inpatients (T2D group), 30 healthy participants with BMI ranged from 19 to 23.9 kg/m2 (CTL group) and 30 metabolically healthy obese controls with BMI ? 30 kg/m2 (MHO group) were employed in our study. Peripheral frequencies of Th22 and Th1 and Th17 cells were determined by flow cytometry based on their specific cytokine patterns. Cytokine levels in fresh plasma were quantified by ELISA.Compared to that in CTL group (1.18±0.06%, n?=?28), peripheral frequency of Th22 cells was significantly increased in MHO group (1.88±0.10%, n?=?30) and in T2D group (2.247±0.10%, n?=?89). There was a consistent notable increase in plasma interleukin (IL)-22 of T2D patients [47.56 (30.55-76.89) pg/mL] as compared with that of MHO group [36.65 (29.52-55.70) pg/ml; *P<0.0001] and CTLs [36.33 (31.93-40.62) pg/mL; *P<0.0001]. Furthermore, other than Th1/Th17, previously frequently described participants in obesity and T2D, there was a strong correlation between Th22 frequency and the homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance index (r?=?0.6771, *P<0.0001) and HOMA for ?-cell function (r?=?-0.7264, *P<0.0001).There were increased Th22 frequencies and IL-22 levels in obesity and T2D. Elevated Th22 and IL-22 also aided in the differentiation of MHO from T2D patients. The notable correlation implied that Th22 might play a more determinant role in both insulin resistance and ?-cell impairment.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465695","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.860462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.711058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.467669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.438935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.428039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.401318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.329805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.320801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.319308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.165123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Homeostatic model assessment","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostatic_model_assessment"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.0124064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"}]}
