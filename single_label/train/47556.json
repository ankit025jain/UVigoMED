{"id":47556,"title":"High urine IP-10 levels associate with chronic HCV infection.","abstract":"Independent of IL-28B polymorphisms, blood IP-10 is a promising biomarker for predicting therapy response in chronic HCV infection. Urine IP-10 has been proposed as a biomarker in tuberculosis, but to date, no urine biomarkers for HCV infection have been evaluated. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed whether IP-10 is detectable in the urine of chronically HCV-infected patients, and if so, whether urine IP-10 correlates with serum IP-10 and HCV-specific clinical parameters.IP-10 was measured by ELISA in serum and urine concomitantly taken from 38 HCV-viremic patients, 10 cured-HCV subjects and 11 healthy donors enrolled as controls.The urine of HCV-viremic patients showed measurable amounts of IP-10, although significantly lower than in serum (p < 0.0001). Urine IP-10 was normalized with creatinuria levels and we found that the urine IP-10/creatinuria ratio was significantly higher in HCV-viremic patients than in cured-HCV subjects (p = 0.002) and healthy donors (p = 0.008), and that it significantly correlated with transaminases (p = 0.01), although the correlation was low. Similarly, the serum IP-10 level significantly associated with HCV-viremic patients (p < 0.0001) and correlated with transaminases (p < 0.0001).For the first time to our knowledge, we show that IP-10 is detected and increased in the urine of HCV-viremic patients compared to healthy donors and cured-HCV subjects.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582930","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.44917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.0169634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Electron donor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_donor"},{"name":"Interleukin 28","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_28"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}]}
