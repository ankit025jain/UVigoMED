{"id":43316,"title":"[Effect of different acupoint prescriptions on prevention and treatment of stress gastric ulcer].","abstract":"To investigate the effects of different acupoint combination on prevention and treatment of stress gastric ulcer and to search for a better acupoint combination.The theoretical basis and experimental research on treatment of stomach diseases with the combination of he-(sea) points and front-mu points as well as back-shu points and front-mu points are analyzed in this article.The combination of he-sea points and front-mu points is suitable to be applied on acute diseases, febrile diseases and diseases of fu organs. While the combination of back-shu points and front-mu points is more applicable on chronic gastric diseases.It is proved that the combination of he-sea point (Zusanli ST 36) and front-mu point (Zhongwan CV 12) has reliable effect on prevention and treatment of stress gastric ulcer.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796050","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.897587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.73612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.661372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.466177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.457756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.425847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Fu (poetry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_(poetry)"},{"name":"Theory (mathematical logic)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_(mathematical_logic)"}]}
