{"id":76111,"title":"Neuroprotective role of Indirubin-3'-monoxime, a GSK? inhibitor in high fat diet induced cognitive impairment in mice.","abstract":"Recent studies have highlighted that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia is one of the main characteristics of type 2 DM. Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that insulin resistance contributes to AD pathogenesis. However the molecular mechanisms of association between these still remain elusive. Among the various possible mechanisms, the GSK-3? activity has been reported to be impaired in insulin-resistance, type 2 DM and AD. Thus, the present study was designed to explore the neuroprotective role of GSK3 ? inhibitor, Indirubin-3'-monoxime (IMX) in insulin resistance induced cognitive impairment. Further, we have explored the possible molecular mechanism involved in cognitive impairment associated with insulin resistance. The mice subjected to high fat diet exhibited characteristic features of insulin resistance viz. increased serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels and impaired spatial learning and memory ability along with reduced brain insulin level, elevated oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. The observed changes occurred concurrently with reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor. In contrast, the mice treated with IMX showed a significant reduction in plasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels and improvement in learning and memory performance, attenuated the oxidative stress and AChE activity. Moreover, IMX dose dependently augment the brain insulin and BDNF levels in HFD fed mice. Based upon these findings it could be suggested that GSK3 ? inhibition could prove to be beneficial in insulin resistance induced cognitive deficit and this neuroprotection could be the result of enhanced BDNF based synaptic plasticity.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
