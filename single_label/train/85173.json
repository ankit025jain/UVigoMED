{"id":85173,"title":"[Nursing outcomes for ineffective breathing patterns and impaired spontaneous ventilation in intensive care].","abstract":"This study aimed to validate the results of Nursing selected from the link NANDA-I-NOC (Nursing Outcomes Classification--NANDA--International) for diagnosis Ineffective Breathing Pattern and Impaired Spontaneous Ventilation in adult intensive care unit. This is a content validation study conducted in a university hospital in southern Brazil with 15 expert nurses with clinical experience and knowledge of the ratings. The instruments contained five-point Likert scales to rate the importance of each outcome (1st step) and indicator (Step 2) for the diagnoses studied. We calculated weighted averages for each outcome/indicator, considering) 1 = 0. 2 = 0.25, 3 = 0.50 4 = 0.75 and 5 = 1. The outcomes suggested by the NOC with averages above 0.8 were considered validated as well as the indicators. The results Respiratory State--airway permeability (Ineffective Breathing Patterns) and 11 indicators, and Response to mechanical ventilation: adult (Impaired Spontaneous Ventilation) with 26 indicators were validated.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080711","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.795077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.724192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.668312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.649698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"University","weight":0.189263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Likert scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"National Olympic Committee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"South Region, Brazil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
