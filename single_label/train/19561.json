{"id":19561,"title":"Coccidioidomycosis in a Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens).","abstract":"An 11 yr-old female Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) demonstrated decreased appetite and weight loss approximately 4 wk after truck transport from a northern California facility to a southern California facility. An initial blood analysis revealed a leukocytosis of 22,800 white blood cells (WBC)/microl, with a left shift, low iron (58 microg/dl), and mild hyperglobulinemia (4.3 g/dl). Empiric antibiotic therapy was started with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (14 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.). Clinical improvement was observed initially; however, follow-up blood analysis demonstrated a persistent leukocytosis (24,000 WBC/microl), with left shift and progressive hyperglobulinemia (6.7 mg/dl). As a result of the relapse of clinical signs on antibiotic therapy, aggressive antifungal therapy was initiated with voriconazole (1.8 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d.). Concurrent fungal immunodiffusion antibody assays and complement fixation were repetitively positive for coccidioidomycosis. The walrus improved clinically over the next 3 mo and is currently stable on antifungal therapy at its originating facility in northern California.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712180","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Leukocytosis","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.762615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.745682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Coccidioidomycosis","weight":0.723868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidioidomycosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Appetite","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.672482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.660218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.561886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.51131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.466442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.358563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Voriconazole","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voriconazole"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.316615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"California","weight":0.295016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pacific Ocean","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Walrus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walrus"},{"name":"Clavulanic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavulanic_acid"},{"name":"Complement fixation test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_fixation_test"},{"name":"Immunodiffusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodiffusion"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Truck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck"},{"name":"Southern California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California"},{"name":"Northern California","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
