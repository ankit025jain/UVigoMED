{"id":78444,"title":"Prospective, randomised, controlled trial comparing delivery of patient information for functional endoscopic sinus surgery via website versus printed leaflet.","abstract":"To compare the efficacy of two modes of delivery of information for patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery: website and printed leaflet.A two-centre, prospective, single-blinded, randomised, controlled trial was conducted, comparing mode of information delivery. Adult patients were randomly allocated to receive pre-operative information regarding functional endoscopic sinus surgery, either via a website or a printed leaflet. Primary outcomes, measured by questionnaire, were: readability, usability and recall of complications.Fifty-eight patients were recruited. Fifty met the inclusion criteria, of which 40 were analysed in the study (20 patients per group), meeting the power criteria set. There were 18 male and 22 female patients, ranging in age from 21 to 76 years (mean, 47 years). Patients found both the printed leaflet and the website readable, and were satisfied with the usability of both modes. There were similar rates for recall of complications in both study arms.Patient information on functional endoscopic sinus surgery can be provided either as a printed leaflet or a website, with similar rates for usability, readability and recall of complications. These findings could help tailor the provision of pre-operative information for patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery, based on patient preference.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666802","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.334742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.115961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Readability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability"},{"name":"Leaflet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaflet"},{"name":"Mode (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)"},{"name":"Electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Tailor","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor"},{"name":"Functional endoscopic sinus surgery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_endoscopic_sinus_surgery"},{"name":"Recall election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Usability","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"}]}
