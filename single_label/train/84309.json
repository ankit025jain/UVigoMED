{"id":84309,"title":"Low-level laser/light therapy for androgenetic alopecia.","abstract":"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a persistent and pervasive condition that affects men worldwide. Some common treatment options for AGA include hair prosthetics, oral and topical medications, and surgical hair restoration (SHR). Pharmaceutical and SHR treatments are associated with limitations including adverse side effects and significant financial burden. Low-level laser or light (LLL) devices offer alternative treatment options that are not typically associated with adverse side effects or significant costs. There are clinic- and home-based LLL devices. One home-based laser comb device has set a standard for others; however, this device requires time devoted to carefully moving the comb through the hair to allow laser penetration to the scalp. A novel helmet-like LLL device for hair growth has proven effective in preliminary trials and allows for hands-free use. Regardless, there are few clinical trials that have been conducted regarding LLL devices for AGA and results are mixed. Further research is required to establish the true efficacy of these devices for hair growth in comparison to existing alternative therapies.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134310","annotations":[{"name":"Topical","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.746783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.712152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.709756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.544019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.422042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.322485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.268501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.215948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Advanced_Graphics_Architecture"},{"name":"Hair restoration","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_restoration"},{"name":"Handsfree","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handsfree"},{"name":"Androgenic alopecia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_alopecia"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory"},{"name":"Hirsutism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"SHR (operating system)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHR_(operating_system)"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Comb","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb"}]}
