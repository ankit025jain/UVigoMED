{"id":91162,"title":"Migration of a Kirschner pin from the shoulder to the lung, requiring surgery.","abstract":"A 62-year-old woman underwent a reduction of a proximal reduced humeral fracture, which was fixed by 3 Kirschner pins. One year later, the orthopedic surgeon failed to remove one of the wires. The patient was lost to follow-up, and 4 years later, she presented with hemoptysis, revealing migration of the pin to the lung. The pin was removed through a thoracotomy. Migration to the lung is often revealed by hemoptysis or pneumothorax. Close follow-up and early removal of the pins are mandatory.
