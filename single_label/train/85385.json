{"id":85385,"title":"Protective effect of Ginkgo biloba leaves extract, EGb761, on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury via a JNK- and Akt-dependent NF?B pathway.","abstract":"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a clinical syndrome mainly caused by Gram-negative bacteria which is still in need of an effective therapeutic medicine. EGb761, an extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, has several bioeffects including anti-inflammation, cardioprotection, neuroprotection, and free radical scavenging. Preadministration of EGb761 inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced histopathological changes and exchange of arterial blood gas. In addition, LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, interleukin (IL)-6, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), were suppressed by EGb761. The activation of nuclear factor (NF)?B, a transcription factor of proinflammatory mediators, and phosphorylation of I?B, an inhibitor of NF?B, were also reduced by EGb761. Furthermore, we found the inhibitory concentration of EGb761 on phosphorylation of JNK and Akt was less than those of ERK and p38 MAPK. In conclusion, EGb761 is a potential protective agent for ALI, possibly via downregulating the JNK- and Akt-dependent NF?B activation pathway.
