{"id":34388,"title":"[Analysis of a case with typical Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome with scleroderma-like skin changes and review of literature].","abstract":"To explore clinical, radiographical and genetic characteristics of classical Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS).Data of a case of HGPS diagnosed at Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology was analyzed and related literature was reviewed.At the age of 8 months, the affected-infant presented with characteristic manifestation such as short stature, low weight, frontal bossing, alopecia, prominent scalp veins, micrognathia with a vertical midline groove in the chin, sclerodermatous skin, knee joints contracture with a horse-riding stance, and limited range of movement of ankle joints. Blood test showed blood platelet count (416-490) Ã—10(9)/L. Lower extremities MRI showed reduced subcutaneous fat. LMNA gene analysis showed that the affected-infant carried typical heterozygous mutation: c. 1824C>T (p. G608G), while his parents were normal. At the age of 13 months, X-rays showed short distal phalanges and clavicles with acro-osteolysis. After following up for 15 months, his appearance of progeria became more apparent. As far as we know, there are only 2 cases of classical HGPS confirmed by gene analysis in China.Classical HGPS should be considered when infants appeared with sclerodermatous skin. Genetic analysis could help to diagnose classical HGPS as early as possible and avoid unnecessary investigations. In addition, affected-infants need to be long term followed-up and provided genetic counseling.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
