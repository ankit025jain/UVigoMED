{"id":55808,"title":"Long-term outcomes and complications of trabeculectomy for secondary glaucoma in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.","abstract":"Secondary glaucoma is a serious complication in patients with transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). We assessed the long-term outcomes and complications of trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC) for secondary glaucoma associated with FAP.Medical case records of Kumamoto University Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-one eyes of 13 patients (10 with FAP ATTR Val30Met; 3 with FAP ATTR Tyr114Cys) underwent trabeculectomy with MMC and follow-up of at least 2 years. The primary outcome measure was Kaplan-Meier survival, with failure of this treatment being defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) of ?5 mm Hg or ?22 mm Hg on two consecutive visits or as additional operations needed to reduce IOP. Secondary outcome measures included complications, bleb characteristics, and additional postoperative interventions required.The mean postoperative follow-up period was 5.7 years (range, 2.2-12.7 years). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated probabilities of success of 0.76, 0.67, and 0.53 at 1, 2, and 3 years after operation, respectively. Significant complications included ocular decompression retinopathy in 7 eyes (33%) and bleb encapsulation in 10 eyes (48%). Twelve eyes (57%) needed additional surgery, such as bleb revision or trabeculectomy with MMC, to reduce IOP.Trabeculectomy with MMC may not be optimal for patients with FAP-related glaucoma and may have several significant complications.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24802803","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.776563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.724672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Mitomycin","weight":0.709104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitomycin"},{"name":"Trabeculectomy","weight":0.656815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabeculectomy"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.606474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Kumamoto University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamoto_University"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Transthyretin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin"},{"name":"Kumamoto City","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamoto_City"},{"name":"Met 3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_3"},{"name":"Bleb (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleb_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Familial adenomatous polyposis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_adenomatous_polyposis"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"MultiMediaCard","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"22 mm grenade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22_mm_grenade"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"}]}
