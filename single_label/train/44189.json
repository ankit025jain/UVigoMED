{"id":44189,"title":"M1- and M2-macrophage polarization in rat liver cirrhosis induced by thioacetamide (TAA), focusing on Iba1 and galectin-3.","abstract":"Resident and exudate macrophages play an important role in the development of liver cirrhosis. Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1(+) (Iba1(+)) and galectin-3(+) (Gal-3(+)) macrophages regulate liver fibrosis probably through pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors. Macrophages show polarized functions in liver fibrosis; however, M1-/M2-polarization of Iba1(+) and Gal-3(+) macrophages remains obscured. This study investigated the M1-/M2-polarized properties of Iba1(+) and Gal-3(+) macrophages in chemical-induced liver cirrhosis.Cirrhosis was induced in F344 rats by repeated injections of thioacetamide (100mg/kg BW, twice a week for 25 weeks). Liver samples were collected from post-first-injection (PFI) week 5 to 25. Macrophage immunophenotypes and myofibroblasts in the fibrous bridges (FBs) and pseudolobules (PLs) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Expressions of M1- and M2-related factors were analyzed with RT-PCR, separately in FBs and PLs.Activation of myofibroblasts was most pronounced in livers at week 15. CD68(+) (M1), CD204(+) (M2), Iba1(+) and Gal-3(+) macrophages in the FBs increased gradually and peaked at week 15, consistent with the upregulation of both M1-(MCP-1, IFN-?, IL-1?, IL-6, and TNF-?) and M2-(TGF-?1, IL-4, and IL-10) related factors. Iba1(+) and Gal-3(+) macrophages showed both M1- and M2-immunophenotypes. CD163(+) macrophages showed a persistent increase, consistent with TGF-?1 upregulation. MHC class II(+) macrophages increased in the developing fibrotic lesions, and then reduced in the advanced stage cirrhosis.Both M1- and M2-macrophage polarizations occur during development of liver cirrhosis. Iba1(+) and Gal-3(+) macrophages participate in liver cirrhosis through production of both M1- and M2-related factors.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747241","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.872134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.828879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.660126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"CCL2","weight":0.650522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL2"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.537674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.523377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.476849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Myofibroblast","weight":0.418153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblast"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.379276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.177943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"CD68","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD68"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Galactose","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Metacarpophalangeal joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpophalangeal_joint"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Biological warfare","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"}]}
