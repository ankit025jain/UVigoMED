{"id":79582,"title":"Discovery of covalent inhibitors of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a target for the treatment of malaria.","abstract":"We developed a new class of covalent inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a validated target for the treatment of malaria, by screening a small library of 3-bromo-isoxazoline derivatives that inactivate the enzyme through a covalent, selective bond to the catalytic cysteine, as demonstrated by mass spectrometry. Substituents on the isoxazolinic ring modulated the potency up to 20-fold, predominantly due to an electrostatic effect, as assessed by computational analysis.
