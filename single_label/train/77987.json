{"id":77987,"title":"Imaging for cochlear implantation: structuring a clinically relevant report.","abstract":"Cochlear implantation is a proven treatment for bilateral severe to profound hearing loss. Imaging has an important role in deciding candidacy, providing realistic preoperative counselling, and predicting postoperative outcomes. Imaging also provides information about the potential difficulties a surgeon may encounter during the implantation. High-resolution computed tomography and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging complement each other in assessing different aspects of the temporal bone and the auditory pathway in such patients. This review provides a structured format for reading pre-cochlear implant imaging studies with special focus on the surgeon's expectations in order to prepare a clinically relevant report. A constant communication between the imaging specialist and the cochlear implant surgeon improves image interpretation and ensures a successful implantation.
