{"id":50709,"title":"Treatment effectiveness of pasireotide on health-related quality of life in patients with Cushing's disease.","abstract":"Cushing's disease (CD) can significantly impair patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study investigated the treatment effectiveness of pasireotide on HRQOL of CD patients, and assessed the relationships between HRQOL and urinary free cortisol (UFC) and CD-related signs and symptoms.In this phase III, randomized, double-blind study, patients with UFC ?1.5Ã—upper limit of normal (ULN) received s.c. pasireotide 600 or 900??g twice daily. The trial primary endpoint was UFC at or below ULN at month 6 without dose titration. Open-label treatment continued through month 12. HRQOL was measured using the Cushing's Quality of Life Questionnaire (CushingQoL) instrument at baseline and follow-up visits until month 12 during which clinical signs and features of CD, and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), were also collected.Pearson's/Spearman's correlations between changes in CushingQoL and changes in clinical signs and symptoms were assessed. Changes in CushingQoL and the proportion of patients achieving a clinically meaningful improvement in CushingQoL were also compared among patients stratified by mean UFC (mUFC) control status (controlled, partially controlled, and uncontrolled) at month 6. Analyses were also conducted at month 12, with multivariable adjustment for baseline characteristics and CushingQoL.Change in CushingQoL was significantly correlated with changes in mUFC (r=-0.40), BMI (r=-0.39), weight (r=-0.41), and BDI-II (r=-0.54) at month 12 but not at month 6. The percentage of CushingQoL responders at month 12 based on month 6 mUFC control status were as follows: 63, 58.8, and 37.9% in the controlled, partially controlled, and uncontrolled groups respectively. Adjusted CushingQoL scores at month 12 were 58.3 for controlled patients (?=11.5 vs uncontrolled, P=0.012) and 54.5 for partially controlled patients (?=7.7 vs uncontrolled, P=0.170).Pasireotide treatment can result in a meaningful HRQOL improvement among those who complete a 12-month treatment period, most often among patients achieving biochemical control.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760537","annotations":[{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.868787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.825081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.631552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.5022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.498671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Beck Depression Inventory","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_Depression_Inventory"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.255301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ultimate Fighting Championship","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"},{"name":"UFC 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_1"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Beck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
