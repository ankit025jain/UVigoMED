{"id":79392,"title":"Cumulative disease activity predicts incidental hearing impairment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).","abstract":"We previously reported that 24% of 113 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients had hearing impairment (HI). We investigated if disease activity was a predictor of incidental HI. One hundred and four patients completed three consecutive 6 months-apart rheumatic evaluations and concomitant audiometric evaluations which included at least an interview, an otoscopic evaluation, and a pure tone audiometry. HI was defined if the average thresholds for at least one of low-, mid-, or high-frequency ranges were ?25 decibels (dB) hearing level in one or both ears. Appropriated statistics was used. Internal review board approval was obtained. Patients were most frequently middle-aged (43.4 Â± 13.3 years), female (89.4%), and had median disease duration of 5 years and low disease activity. All were receiving RA treatment. At inclusion, 24 patients had HI which was sensorineural in 91.7% of them. Among the 80 patients without HI at baseline, 10 (12.5%) developed incidental HI, and they had more disease activity either at baseline ([median, range] disease activity score-28 joints evaluated-C-reactive protein [DAS28-CRP], 3.9 [1.6-7.3] vs. 2.1 [1-8.7], p = 0.006) or cumulative previous incidental HI (3.4 [1.8-4.8] vs. 2 [1-6.2], p = 0.007) and were more frequently on combined methotrexate and sulfasalazine (20 vs. 1.4%, p = 0.05) than their counterparts. In the adjusted Cox proportional model, cumulative DAS28-CRP was the only variable to predict incidental HI (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.7; p = 0.01). Almost 13% of RA patients with short disease duration and low disease activity developed incidental HI during 1 year. Cumulative disease activity predicted incidental HI.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435352","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.693846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.552547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.449433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.366471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.338889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.252778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.12668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0605664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Pure tone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_tone"},{"name":"Sulfasalazine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfasalazine"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Pitch (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"}]}
