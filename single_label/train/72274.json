{"id":72274,"title":"Additional diagnostic value of MRI in patients with suspicious breast lesions based on ultrasound.","abstract":"Biopsy has long been the standard approach in Breast Imaging Reporting and Data SystemÂ® (BI-RADS) 4 or BI-RADS 5 (American College of Radiology, Reston, VA) lesions despite a wide variation in reported incidence of malignancy in BI-RADS 4 lesions. This study examined the diagnostic value of breast MRI as well as its ability to decrease unnecessary biopsies in patients with solid breast lesions who had an indication for biopsy.In this retrospective study, 277 breast lesions with a documented histological diagnosis as established by ultrasound-guided biopsy were included. All patients were female, and biopsy was performed owing to a BI-RADS score of 4 or 5 on ultrasonography. In addition, all patients had undergone MRI before biopsy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI in predicting malignancy were calculated.When all lesions were analysed, sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of MRI in detecting malignancy were 94.2%, 56.1%, 90.7% and 68.1%, respectively. When only ultrasonographic BI-RADS 4 lesions are considered, the corresponding figures were as follows: 90.9%, 56.7%, 93.8% and 46.4%, respectively. False-negative rate of MRI for the latter group of lesions was 2.6%. 42% of unnecessary biopsies were avoided in sonographic BI-RADS 4 lesions.Despite promising results obtained in this study, dynamic MRI currently does not seem to be effective in ruling out the need for biopsy in the assessment of sonographic BI-RADS 4 lesions. However, advanced MRI techniques may assist in improving possible benefits of MRI in this patient group.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983629","annotations":[{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.902289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"BI-RADS","weight":0.495147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BI-RADS"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"American College of Radiology","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Radiology"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
