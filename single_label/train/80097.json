{"id":80097,"title":"[Effects of adjusting doses of diuretics at different time in treatment of advanced schistosomiasis ascites].","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy and safety of adjusting the doses of diuretics of different time in the treatment of advanced schistosomiasis ascites.A total of 80 advanced schistosomiasis patients with ascites were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group (40 cases each). The patients in the observation group received spironolactone and furosemide, and the first doses were 100 mg/d and 40 mg/d, respectively. If the efficacy was poor, according to the first doses of the standard increments once every four days, the doses gradually increased to the maximum doses of spironolactone 400 mg/d and furosemide 160 mg/d, respectively. The patients in the control group received spironolactone and furosemide, and the first doses were the same as those of the observation group. If the efficacy was poor, according to the first doses of the standard increments once every seven days, the doses gradually increased to the maximum doses as those of the observation group. Other conventional treatments were the same in both groups.In both groups, the reductions of the total amount of the weight were (5.62 +/- 1.28) kg and (5.42 +/- 1.37) kg respectively; the time of efficacy beginning was (3.84 +/- 2.36) days and (4.65 +/- 2.86) days respectively; the average daily amounts of weight loss were (0.41 +/- 0.16) kg and (0.35 +/- 0.11) kg respectively; the efficient rates were 95% and 92.5% respectively; and there were no significant differences between the two group(all P > 0.05). However, the time of reduction from moderate ascites to mild ascites was (10.70 +/- 3.01) days (6-20 days) in the observation group and the time was (14.75 +/- 5.62) days (7-30 days) in the control group (u = 3.876, P < 0.01).The therapy of diuretic doses adjusted by a four-day cycle is more useful for advanced schistosomiasis patients with ascites.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800582","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.366952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.285578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.281105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.246057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.10542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Furosemide","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furosemide"},{"name":"Spironolactone","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spironolactone"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"730","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/730"},{"name":"876","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/876"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Moru language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moru_language"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
