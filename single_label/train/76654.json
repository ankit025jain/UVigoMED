{"id":76654,"title":"Atorvastatin helps preserve pancreatic ? cell function in obese C57BL/6 J mice and the effect is related to increased pancreas proliferation and amelioration of endoplasmic-reticulum stress.","abstract":"3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins are competitive inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Currently, statins are used as first-line therapy in the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia. However, effects of statins on ? cell function remains unclear. This study aims to examine effects of atorvastatin treatment on pancreatic ? cell function in obese C57BL/6 J mice and the possible mechanisms.Diet-induced obesity (DIO) C57BL/6 J mice were treated with atorvastatin (30 mg/kg/day) for 58 days. ? cell function was assessed by hyperglycemic clamp and the area of insulin-positive ? cells was examined by immunofluorescence. Gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related proteins were examined by Western blot. Additionally, cell viability and apoptosis of the cholesterol-loaded NIT-1 cells were investigated after atorvastatin treatment.Hyperglycemic clamp study revealed that glucose infusion rate (GIR) and insulin stimulation ratio in atorvastatin-treated DIO mice were markedly higher than control mice (P?<?0.05, P?<?0.01 vs. con), indicating preserved ?-cell sensitivity to glucose. Lipid profiles of plasma triglyceride (TG), pancreas TG and plasma cholesterol (CHO) were improved. Pancreas weight and weight index were improved significantly after atorvastatin treatment (P?<?0.05 vs. con). Immunofluorescence results showed that atorvastatin-treated mice had significantly larger insulin-positive ? cell area (P?<?0.05 vs. con). Furthermore, RT-PCR and western blot showed that the mRNA and protein expression of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) in the pancreas were upregulated (P?<?0.001, P?<?0.01 vs. con). Moreover, the expression level of ER stress markers of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2? (eIF2?) were downregulated in the pancreas of atorvastatin-treated mice (P?<?0.001, P?<?0.01, P?<?0.01 vs. con). Besides, atorvastatin protected the pancreatic ? cell line of NIT-1 from cholesterol-induced apoptosis. Western blot showed increased expression of anti-apoptotic protein of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2).Pancreatic ? cell function of obese C57BL/6 J mice was preserved after atorvastatin treatment, and this improvement may be attributed to enhanced pancreas proliferation and amelioration of pancreatic ER stress.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
