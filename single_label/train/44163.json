{"id":44163,"title":"[Computer search for molecular mechanisms of ulcerogenic action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs].","abstract":"\"Peptic ulcers\" is the most frequent side effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Experimental data indicate that pathogenesis of peptic ulcers cannot be explained only by the inhibition of cyclooxygenases. The knowledge about other molecular mechanisms of action of drugs related with development of peptic ulcers could be useful for design of new safe NSAIDs. However, considerable time and material resources are needed for corresponding experimental research. For simplification of experimental search, we have developed an approach for in silico identification of probable molecular mechanisms of action of drugs related with its side effects. We have created the set of NSAIDs containing 85 substances with data about structures and side effects. The computer program PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) predicting more than 3000 molecular mechanisms of action based on structural formula of substances was used to estimate unknown molecular mechanisms of action for these set of NSAIDs. Statistically significant relationships between predicted molecular mechanisms of action and development of peptic ulcers have been established. We have discovered twenty-six molecular mechanisms of action (two known previously and twenty-four new) which probably related with development of peptic ulcers. By analyzing of Gene Ontology data, signal and metabolic pathways, publications in Medline, we formulated hypotheses about the role of ten molecular mechanisms of action in pathogenesis of peptic ulcer.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749244","annotations":[{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.91605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.901907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.753922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.655795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.653936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.629747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.504371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.475452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.467308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.443527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Side effect","weight":0.412878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.363935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.336064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"In silico","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.148919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Structural formula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_formula"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Gene Ontology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ontology"},{"name":"Computer program","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Search algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm"},{"name":"Ontology","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"}]}
