{"id":83203,"title":"Radiation therapy for hypersalivation: a prospective study in 50 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and the tolerance of radiation therapy (RT) on salivary glands in a large series of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with hypersalivation.Fifty ALS patients that had medically failure pretreatment were included in this prospective study. RT was delivered through a conventional linear accelerator with 6-MV photons and 2 opposed beams fields including both submandibular glands and two-thirds of both parotid glands. Total RT dose was 10 Gy in 2 fractions (n=30) or 20 Gy in 4 fractions (n=20). RT efficacy was assessed with the 9-grade Sialorrhea Scoring Scale (SSS), recently prospectively validated as the most effective and sensitive tool to measure sialorrhea in ALS patients.At the end of RT, all patients had improved: 46 had a complete response (92% CR, SSS 1-3) and 4 had a partial response (8% PR, SSS 4-5). A significant lasting salivary reduction was observed 6 months after RT completion: there was 71% CR and 26% PR, and there was a significant SSS reduction versus baseline (P<10(-6)). There was no grade 3 to 4 toxicity, and most side effects (34%) occurred during RT. Nine patients (18%) underwent a second salivary gland RT course, with a 3-months mean delay from the first RT, resulting in a SSS decrease (-77%). Both RT dose regimens induced a significant SSS decrease with no significant toxicity. There were, however, more patients with CR/PR in the 20-Gy protocol (P=.02), and 8 of 9 patients (89%) receiving a second RT course had previously been treated within the 10-Gy protocol.Radiation therapy of 20 Gy in 4 fractions is an efficient and safe treatment for ALS patients with sialorrhea. A shorter RT course (10 Gy in 2 fractions) may be proposed in patients in poor medical condition.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411632","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.901242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.763692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hypersalivation","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersalivation"},{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.499137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.445466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.444231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Linear particle accelerator","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator"},{"name":"Photon","weight":0.295799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.259122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.175428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.139042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Siding Spring Survey","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siding_Spring_Survey"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Beam (structure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(structure)"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Submandibular ganglion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submandibular_ganglion"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Critically Endangered","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_Endangered"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Efficiency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Particle accelerator","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator"}]}
