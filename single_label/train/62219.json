{"id":62219,"title":"Lenalidomide plus rituximab can produce durable clinical responses in patients with relapsed or refractory, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","abstract":"This phase II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Patients were treated with daily lenalidomide in 28-d cycles and weekly rituximab for 4 weeks. Lenalidomide was continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Twenty-two patients were assessed for FCGR3A polymorphisms. Thirty patients were enrolled; 27 were evaluable for response. The overall response rate (ORR) was 74% including 44% complete responses (CR); median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12路4 months. The 13 rituximab refractory patients had an ORR of 61路5% (four CR/unconfirmed CR). The ORR was 77% in the 22 follicular lymphoma patients (nine CR/unconfirmed CR). At a median follow-up time of 43 months, the median duration of response and time to next therapy were 15路4 and 37路4 months, respectively. Most common grade 3/4 adverse events were lymphopenia (45%), neutropenia (55%), fatigue (23%) and hyponatraemia (9%). The ORR and PFS in patients with low-affinity FCGR3A polymorphisms (F/F and F/V) suggest that lenalidomide may improve the activity of rituximab in these patients. These data suggest that combining lenalidomide with rituximab can produce durable responses with acceptable toxicity in patients with indolent NHL.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606326","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.790996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.737674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.620168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.609087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Lymphocytopenia","weight":0.444256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytopenia"},{"name":"Hyponatremia","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.325809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.258524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"National Hockey League","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Office of Rail Regulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Rail_Regulation"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Fishing vessel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
