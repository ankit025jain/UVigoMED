{"id":52544,"title":"Prevalence of metabolic syndrome among Nepalese type 2 diabetic patients.","abstract":"This study was carried out to establish the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the type 2 diabetic patients in Nepal. Two hundred twenty one participants aged 26-90 (mean age 53.41 +/- 13.30) years with established type 2 diabetes visiting Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from August 2011 to November 2011 were included in the study. National Cholesterol Education Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATPIII) definition of the metabolic syndrome with ethnic threshold on abdominal obesity was used. 170 (76.9%) participants were found to have metabolic syndrome. Thirty two (14.5%) participants fulfilled all 5 criteria for metabolic syndrome, 63 (28.5%) participants had four criteria while three criteria were fulfilled by 75 (33.9%) of the participants. Among the patients having metabolic syndrome, hypertension was seen in 89 (52.35%) participants, raised serum triglyceride levels were found in 144 (84.70%) subjects, decreased serum HDL cholesterol levels were found in 119 (70%) participants while in 108 (63.35%) participants increased waist circumference was found. There was a higher frequency of metabolic syndrome in obese (81.58%) and in overweight (79.49%) subjects. This study indicates significant prevalence of metabolic syndrome among type 2 diabetic patients with strong association of obesity.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592795","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.832399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"National Cholesterol Education Program","weight":0.713328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cholesterol_Education_Program"},{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Nepal","weight":0.523919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.419011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.258198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.251888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.148784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
