{"id":85501,"title":"[Risk factors of bronchial asthma among people aged over 14 years in China].","abstract":"To survey the risk factors of asthma among the people aged over 14 years in China.Home visits for completing epidemiological questionnaires in accordance with stratified cluster random sampling survey were conducted in 8 provinces (cities) of China residents aged over 14 years from February 2010 to August 2011. Asthma was diagnosed based upon case history, clinical signs and lung function test. The SPSS 12.0 software was used for statistic analyses for the epidemiological status of asthma.Sampling population was composed of 180 099 subjects. Among 164 215 valid questionnaires, there were 79 692 males and 84 523 females, 2 034 had asthma. The overall prevalence rate was 1.2% (2 034/164 215). Correlation analyses showed that the risk factors were smoking (OR = 1.697, 95%CI: 1.547-1.861), breast feeding (OR = 0.801, 95%CI: 0.670-0.959), genetics (OR & 95%CI >1, asthma (OR = 10.440, 95%CI: 8.991-12.112)), complications (OR & 95%CI >1), body mass index (compared with normal weight, overweight (OR = 1.360, 95%CI: 1.212-1.531), obesity (OR = 10.631, 95%CI: 9.570-11.801)) and petting (OR & 95%CI >1).Among Chinese asthmatics aged over 14, their risk factors include host (genetics & obesity) and environmental (smoking, breastfeeding, complications & pets) factors.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924882","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass
