{"id":63151,"title":"High prevalence of malignancy in HIV-positive patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy: a study in the era of antiretroviral therapy.","abstract":"Mediastinal lymphadenopathy (MLN) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has a wide spectrum of aetiologies with different prognoses and treatments. The decision to pursue a histopathological diagnosis represents a clinical challenge as patients present with non-specific symptoms. This study aimed to determine the aetiology and predictive factors of MLN in a cohort of HIV-infected patients in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era.Single-centre retrospective cohort study of 217 consecutive HIV-infected patients who underwent computed tomography (CT) of the chest between January 2004 and December 2009. Fifty-two patients were identified to have MLN (>10?mm in short axis). CT images were re-reviewed by an independent radiologist blinded to the clinical information. Final diagnoses of MLN were obtained from clinical records. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of aetiology of MLN.Seventeen patients (33%) had a diagnosis of malignancy. Consolidation on CT was associated with a reduced likelihood of malignancy odds ratio (OR) 0.03 (95% confidence interval 0.002-0.422), and larger lymph nodes were associated with an increase in the odds of malignancy (OR 2.89; 95% confidence interval 1.24-6.71). CD4 count was found not to be a predictor of aetiology of MLN.In the era of combination cART, opportunistic infections and malignancy remain to be the frequent causes of MLN in HIV-positive patients, but the prevalence of non-HIV related malignancy has increased compared with previous studies. Although certain findings are predictors of non-malignant disease, pathological diagnosis of MLN in HIV-positive patients should be pursued whenever possible.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471994","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.779005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.770993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Opportunistic infection","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.729085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.564585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.37964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.371842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Nonspecific symptoms","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonspecific_symptoms"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"}]}
