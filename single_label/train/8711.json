{"id":8711,"title":"[Progress of experimental research on treating Alzheimer's disease by acupuncture].","abstract":"To discuss the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we summarized the mechanisms of treating AD animal models by acupuncture from literatures in recent years as follows. Senile dementia rats' cognitive capabilities and memory could be improved by reduction of beta-amyloid protein, attenuation of excessive phosphorylation of tau protein, regulation of center neurotransmitter dysmetabolism, oxidation of anti-free radicals, reduction of neuron apoptosis in the cortex and the hippocampus, inhibition of glial cells' differentiation, adjustment of G protein signaling transduction, and improvement of the mitochondrial dysfunction, thus providing experimental evidence for treating AD by acupuncture.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758091","annotations":[{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.882415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Neurotransmitter","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter"},{"name":"Tau protein","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.803577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"G protein","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.726962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Neuroglia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.430254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.403356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.395642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.331976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.263159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
