{"id":44243,"title":"Meta-analysis: narrow band imaging for diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia.","abstract":"Distinguishing early gastric cancer is challenging with current imaging techniques. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is effective for characterizing gastric lesions.The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of NBI in the gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM).We performed data analysis using Meta-DiSc (version 1.4) and STATA (version 11.0) software. To assess study quality and potential for bias, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool.Six studies involving 347 patients were included. On a per-patient basis, the sensitivity of NBI for diagnosis of GIM was 0.65 (95% CI ?=? 0.56-0.74), and the specificity was 0.93 (95% CI ?=? 0.88-0.97). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was 0.8731. However, on a per-lesion basis, the sensitivity and specificity of NBI were 0.69 (95% CI ?=? 0.63-0.74) and 0.91 (95% CI ?=? 0.87-0.94), respectively. The SROC was 0.9009. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of magnification endoscopy (NBI-ME) were 0.76 (95% CI ?=? 0.61-0.87) and 0.89 (95% CI ?=? 0.80-0.94), respectively, on per-patient analysis. On a per-lesion basis, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of NBI-ME were 0.84 (95% CI ?=? 0.76-0.89) and 0.93 (95% CI ?=? 0.89-0.96), respectively. Heterogeneity was observed with an I2 for diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 0.01% and 85.8%, respectively. There was no statistical significance for the evaluation of publication bias.Our meta-analysis shows that NBI is a useful tool for differential diagnosis of GIM with relatively low sensitivity and high specificity.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743566","annotations":[{"name":"Publication
