{"id":81667,"title":"Professional oral hygiene procedures do not influence plasma glucose levels in systemically healthy individuals: a short-term, randomised, controlled trial.","abstract":"The treatment of gingival inflammation is associated with improved glycaemic control in diabetic patients. The goal of this parallel-randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to test the shortterm effects of professional oral hygiene procedures on plasma glucose levels in systemically healthy individuals.Systemically healthy individuals with gingivitis and no sign of periodontitis were enrolled at a private practice in Italy. Patients were randomised to either a 1 hour (h) session of professional oral hygiene procedures or to 1 h in the waiting room. Not fasting blood glucose levels were assessed by a blind examiner at baseline (T0), 1 h (T1) and 2 h (T2) after procedures and finally 1 week after (T3). Oral hygiene procedures were then performed also in the control group.Twenty patients were randomly allocated to each group. There were no drop-outs. Blood glucose levels at T0 (P = 0.0001) and time of measurement (P = 0.0001) were statistically significant, while oral hygiene procedures were not (mean difference between groups 0.77 mg/dl, 95%CI -2.64 mg/dl; 4.18 mg/dl, P = 0.6581). Mean blood glucose levels decreased between T0 and T1, were stable between T1 and T2 and showed similar levels to baseline after 1 week (T3) for both groups.This short-term RCT showed that professional oral hygiene procedures were not able to influence plasma glucose levels in individuals with gingivitis, but otherwise systemically healthy.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24892115","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.825469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.797842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.662126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.599188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.369867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.291351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.197887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.160579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.14095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Dental hygienist","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_hygienist"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Kolmogorov space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_space"},{"name":"Waiting room","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_room"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Practice of law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_of_law"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Dropping out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_out"},{"name":"Relaxation (NMR)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(NMR)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
