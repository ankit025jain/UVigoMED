{"id":28449,"title":"[The epidemiology of suicide in bipolar disorder in the manic episode--preliminary reports].","abstract":"Suicide is among ten leading causes of death in each country and the third most common cause of death in the age group 16-35. The presence of mental illness is the most important risk factor for suicide. Affective disorders contribute to 15-25% of deaths due to suicide attempts. Depression is the most likely cause of the patients attempt on his life. Contrary to popular opinion, manic episode can also increase the risk of suicide, especially if the patient dominates by productive symptoms in the form of delusions. The aim of study was to determine the frequency of suicide attempts and their determinants in an episode of mania in bipolar disorder.The study included 16 people with a diagnosed bipolar disorder, hospitalized with manic episode at the age of 28-76. Patients hospitalized in the Department of Adult Psychiatry were selected randomly. The number of suicide attempts, comorbid conditions, and basic epidemiological data were estimated.Five patients declared suicide attempt, one of which wanted to make more than one attempt at suicide. 3 people took it during an episode of depression, two in an episode of mania. The methods of suicide were associated with an overdose of medication and this was accompanied by a greater amount of alcohol intake. 11 persons did not declare any willingness to attempt suicide.A mania episode did not increase the risk of suicide in bipolar disorder compared to an episode of depression in the study conducted. The importance of somatic illness in patients with bipolar disorder is increased if the suicide attempt occurs in an episode of depression. Alcohol abuse showed no negative effects on suicidal behavior of patients. During abuse was the most common way of commit suicide.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868898","annotations":[{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.879203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Manic episode","weight":0.795875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_episode"},{"name":"Failed suicide attempt","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_suicide_attempt"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mania","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Delusion","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Affect (psychology)","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_(psychology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.593174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.540443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Affective spectrum","weight":0.373076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_spectrum"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.358761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0193761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"}]}
