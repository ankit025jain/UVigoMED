{"id":83740,"title":"Experimental research on the effect of mitomycin C fibrin gel on spinal peridural scar tissue in rats.","abstract":"This paper aimed to study the best working concentration of mitomycin C (MMC) fibrin gel on spinal peridural scar tissue in rats and the sustained release function of peridural adhesion after laminectomy of rats. 96 SD rats were divided into four groups. They were conducted L1 laminectomy and sprayed FG-MMC. The concentration of MMC was detected and the best working concentration of MMC was selected. Then other 48 SD rats were divided into four groups to construct L1 vertebral plate excision model. Materials were drawn 4 weeks after the operation for Rydell grading. In addition, we observed HE staining and fibroblast proliferation and collagen distribution situation after Masson staining. And concentration of hydroxyproline was also detected. The best working concentration of MMC experiment showed that except experimental group C, the other groups all appeared drug release peak in the 4th week after the operation. MMC concentration of group C appeared drug release peak in the 5th week besides the 2nd week. Moreover, adhesion of endorhachis and peripheral tissue in group A was the most obvious while the group C was the weakest. Experiment on the slow-release effect of different adhesion materials on peridural adhesion showed that compared to the contrast group and group F, Rydell grading in group E and G was Level 0 and with low adhesion degree, little fibroblast and fibrocyte, low collagen content, regular collagen fibers arrangement and no inflammatory cells after HE staning and Masson staining. In addition, content of hydroxyproline(HOP) decreased significantly especially the group of FG-MMC mixture. It was concluded that MMC fibrin gel mixture had a good slow-release effect on adhesion of spinal peridural scar tissue in rats and the best working concentration was 0.5 mg FG-MMC/ml.
