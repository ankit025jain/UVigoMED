{"id":41867,"title":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in acute cholecystitis in the elderly.","abstract":"Benefits of using laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in the elderly with acute cholecystitis (AC) is still questionable. Our aim is to carry out a comparative analysis of that intervention in two groups of patients: under 65 years old, and over or equal to 65 years old.This study corresponds to 249 LCs carried out during 4 years at the Emergency and Surgery Department of Hospital de S. Jo√£o; 2 groups of individuals were considered: group A--under 65 years old, and group B--65 years old or over. The first consisted of 168 cases (88 men and 80 women, mean age 48.34 years (+/- 11.80)); and the second included 81 patients (40 men and 41 women, mean age 75.73 years (+/- 6.87)). The diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical symptoms, leukocytosis and ultrasound.The comparative analysis between these two groups provided the following results: 1) Mortality: 0% in A vs. 4.76% in B (P = 0.007); 2) Overall postoperative complications: 5.36% in A vs. 22.2% in B (P < 0.001); 3) Surgical complications: 4.76% in A vs. 14.8% in B (P = 0.468); 4) Intraoperative complications: 4.76% in A vs. 4.94% in B (P = 0.007); 5) Reoperations: 2.98% in A vs. 7.41% in B (P = 0.022); 6) Conversion: 12.50% in A vs. 17.28% in B (P = 0.447); 7) Lesion of the Main Bile Duct: 1.79% in A vs. 2.47% in B (P = 0.447); 8) Hospital Stay, equal to or less than 4 days: 72.62% in A vs. 27.16% in B (P <0.001).LC is a safe and efficient intervention in the treatment of acute cholecystitis in the elderly, although with greater morbidity and longer hospital stay, when compared with younger patients.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895786","annotations":[{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.775142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.76877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.632495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.521298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.439867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.368186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.259541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Leukocytosis","weight":0.19889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"249","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/249"},{"name":"Alternating current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current"},{"name":"The Emergency (Ireland)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Bergen Street Line","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_Street_Line"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Macintosh LC","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_LC"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"}]}
