{"id":84224,"title":"Partial monosomy 2p and partial trisomy 4q due to paternal translocation t(2;4)(p25.1;q31.3).","abstract":"Clinical features in patients with segmental aneuploidy often vary depending on the size of the chromosomal segment involved. Monosomy 2p is usually observed as a part of more complex syndromes among probands of balanced reciprocal translocation carriers. Patients with dup4q syndrome have variable clinical features, which are both related to the size of duplicated segment of the 4q and specific associated monosomy. Clinical findings of our patient were compatible with those previously reported in dup4q and del2p patients. Herein are presented the clinical and cytogenetic findings in a 4-year-old female with an unbalanced karyotype 46,XX,der(2)t(2;4)(p25.1;q31.3)pat. Clinical phenotypes of 2p;4q translocation cases are variable, because the involved breakpoints vary case-by-case. We also compare similarity of the clinical features of our proband and other patients carrying either duplication of the distal part of 4q and patients carrying a deletion of distal part of 2p as described in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first case of partial trisomy 4q accompanied with partial monosomy 2p.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145019","annotations":[{"name":"Proband","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.890526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Monosomy","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosomy"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.680583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene duplication","weight":0.512131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication"},{"name":"XY sex-determination system","weight":0.49005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.459697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.376921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"24p","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24p"},{"name":"Reference counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Multiplicative inverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Breakpoint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
