{"id":92421,"title":"Patient dissatisfaction following total knee replacement: a growing concern?","abstract":"A national, multi-centre study was designed in which a questionnaire quantifying the degree of patient satisfaction and residual symptoms in patients following total knee replacement (TKR) was administered by an independent, blinded third party survey centre. A total of 90% of patients reported satisfaction with the overall functioning of their knee, but 66% felt their knee to be 'normal', with the reported incidence of residual symptoms and functional problems ranging from 33% to 54%. Female patients and patients from low-income households had increased odds of reporting dissatisfaction. Neither the use of contemporary implant designs (gender-specific, high-flex, rotating platform) or custom cutting guides (CCG) with a neutral mechanical axis target improved patient-perceived outcomes. However, use of a CCG to perform a so-called kinematically aligned TKR showed a trend towards more patients reporting their knee to feel 'normal' when compared with a so called mechanically aligned TKR This data shows a degree of dissatisfaction and residual symptoms following TKR, and that several recent modifications in implant design and surgical technique have not improved the current situation.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381418","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.180992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.162852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.0496211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Proline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Rotation around a fixed axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis"},{"name":"Team Knight Rider","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Knight_Rider"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Party","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
