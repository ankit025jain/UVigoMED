{"id":44562,"title":"[Quality of DNA from archival pathological samples of gallbladder cancer].","abstract":"The quality of the archival samples stored at pathology services could be a limiting factor for molecular biology studies.To determine the quality of DNA extracted from gallbladder cancer samples at different institutions.One hundred ninety four samples coming from five medical centers in Chile, were analyzed. DNA extraction was quantified determining genomic DNA concentration. The integrity of DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of different length fragments of a constitutive gene (?-globin products of 110, 268 and 501 base pairs).The mean DNA concentration obtained in 194 gallbladder cancer samples was 48 ± 43.1 ng/µl. In 22% of samples, no amplification was achieved despite obtaining a mean DNA concentration of 58.3 ng/ul. In 81, 67 and 22% of samples, a DNA amplification of at least 110, 268 or 501 base pairs was obtained, respectively. No differences in DNA concentration according to the source of the samples were demonstrated. However, there were marked differences in DNA integrity among participating centers. Samples from public hospitals were of lower quality than those from private clinics.Despite some limitations, in 80% of cases, the integrity of DNA in archival samples from pathology services in our country would allow the use of molecular biology techniques.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728429","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.713597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.595733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Chile","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.32212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.237516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.235185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Limiting factor","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_factor"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Constitutive equation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_equation"},{"name":"Globin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globin"},{"name":"Gallbladder cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder_cancer"},{"name":"DNA extraction","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Archive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Private sector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector"},{"name":"Public sector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector"}]}
