{"id":22045,"title":"Association between ACE I/D polymorphism and pulmonary tuberculosis in Chinese population.","abstract":"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health problem worldwide. The objective of the current study is to investigate the possible association of ACE I/D polymorphism with pulmonary TB (PTB) for Chinese in Sichuan province. Three hundred eighty-six PTB patients and 398 healthy controls were genotyped to analyze the I/D polymorphism using PCR method. The results showed that the I/D polymorphism was not associated with susceptibility to PTB for Chinese (D vs. I: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84-1.26, and P=0.77; DD vs. II+DI: OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.73-1.63, and P=0.68; DD+DI vs. II: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.74-1.33, and P=0.98). The I/D polymorphism in the ACE gene may not a risk factor for PTB in Chinese.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573999","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.871261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.833244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Sichuan","weight":0.662454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.660475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.599862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.470755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.330537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"China","weight":0.289202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.159849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"741","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/741"},{"name":"398","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/398"},{"name":"841","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/841"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Doctor of Divinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Divinity"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Global health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Hero (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Angel)"},{"name":"The Id (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Id_(album)"},{"name":"The Gamble (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamble_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
