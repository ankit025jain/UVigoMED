{"id":72267,"title":"The texture quantitative analysis of the normal mammary parenchyma and in breast lesions: acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) technology.","abstract":"The purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) technology in the normal mammary parenchyma and in breast lesions.The virtual touch tissue quantification (VTQ) value was measured on a total of 150 cases in the normal mammary parenchyma and a total of 69 cases in breast lesions (19 cases of nodules, 28 cases of fibroadenoma, and 22 cases of cancer). Then the statistic analysis was carried out on the VTQ value combined with mammographic density, ages, menstrual stages, and pathological result.The VTQ value of mammary parenchyma rose with the increase of the mammographic density, and the value of VTQ had statistical differences in the comparison of group C with group B and in the comparison of group D with group C. The comparison of the VTQ value of the mammary parenchyma in patients with breast cancer and the nodule had statistical difference. The comparison of the VTQ value of the mammary parenchyma in patients with breast cancer, and the fibroadenoma had statistical difference. The value ofVTQ in masses gradually increased in the groups of nodule, fibroadenoma, and breast cancer. There was significant difference in the comparison of VTQ value of the nodule group and the fibroadenoma group with breast cancer group respectively.ARFI-VTQ technology has some reference value in assessing mammographic density. ARFI-VTQ can be used as the quantitative indicater for differentially diagnosing the breast lesions.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984540","annotations":[{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.825549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.735098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.517294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.469129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.388064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.236987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Fibroadenoma","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroadenoma"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.0631725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0239641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Reference range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_range"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Radiation pressure","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure"}]}
