{"id":91021,"title":"Orthogeriatrics moving forward.","abstract":"The role of the orthogeriatrician has grown over the last few years. Orthogeriatrics was primarily involved in the care and management of fragility hip fractures, but has recently been expanded to provide specialist care to patients admitted with other various fractures, the spine, pelvis, appendicular, and those suffered from major trauma. There is also an increasing role for the orthogeriatrician to optimise the pre-operative care of patients undergoing elective joint and spine surgery. Much of what we do incorporates comprehensive geriatric assessment of the frail older person, and research into new and innovative ways of managing various types of fragility fractures such as the use of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways, regional anaesthesia, vertebral augmentation in spinal fractures, sacral augmentation and anabolic treatment in pelvic fractures. Ultimately, this reduces post-operative complication rates, improves outcomes and leads to better patient care and recovery.
