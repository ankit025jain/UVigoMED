{"id":79138,"title":"[Case of iodism complicated with severe airway stenosis due to pharyngolaryngeal edema].","abstract":"A 22-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with dilute iodine tincture poisoning. He had ingested 150 mL in a suicide attempt. On arrival, he was in need of urgent airway management as he was repeatedly vomiting. Although we had difficulty with endotracheal intubation because of remarkable pharyngolaryngeal mucosal edema induced by dilute iodine tincture, we managed to secure the airway. On the 2nd day, laryngoscope showed severe mucosal erosion from the upper to middle pharynx and epiglottis. On the 4th day, we performed a tracheoctomy in anticipation of prolonged airway management. On the 16th day, laryngoscopy showed improvement in each of the 2nd day findings. On the 30th day, the patient was transferred to a psychiatric hospital. Generally, iodine poisoning induces multiple organ disorders and there have been several reports describing iatrogenic iodine poisoning. However, cases of severe airway stenosis due to ingestion of iodine are very rare. Presently, members of the public can easily purchase dilute iodine tincture in Japan, therefore emergency medical personnel should be aware of iodine poisoning as a method of suicide attempt.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483010","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.790876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.749777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Airway management","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_management"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.629798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.475548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.363838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Epiglottis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiglottis"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.198851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.114783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0361946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Medic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medic"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Suicide methods","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_methods"}]}
