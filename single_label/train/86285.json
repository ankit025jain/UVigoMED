{"id":86285,"title":"Constructive remodeling of CorMatrix extracellular matrix after aortic root repair in a 90-year-old woman.","abstract":"An acellular, noncrosslinked, extracellular-matrix bioscaffold patch was used for aortic root reconstruction after aortic valve replacement in a 90-year-old woman. After her death 3 years later, histologic examination showed constructive remodeling and host-tissue regeneration at the site of the extracellular matrix bioscaffold patch.
