{"id":92147,"title":"Transoral anterior revision surgeries for basilar invagination with irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation after posterior decompression: a retrospective study of 30 cases.","abstract":"To report the surgical techniques and clinical results of one-stage transoral anterior revision surgeries for basilar invagination (BI) with atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) after posterior decompression.From September 2008 to June 2012, 30 patients (16 men and 14 women) who had BI with irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation (IAAD) after posterior decompression underwent anterior revision surgeries in our department. Dynamic cervical radiographs, computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance imaging were obtained pre- and postoperatively to assess the degree of AAD and ventral compression on the cervical cord. The JOA scoring system was used to evaluate the neurological status. The revision surgeries were conducted by anterior approach, using the transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate (TARP) system.The revision surgeries were successfully performed in all of the cases. The average follow-up duration was 16 months (range 6-39 months). For all of the cases, complete or more than 50 % reduction and decompression of C1-C2 were achieved. The cervicomedullary angle was improved by an average of 32.9°. Bone fusion was achieved within 3-6 months in all of the cases. Clinical symptoms were alleviated in 29 patients (96.7 %) and stabilised in 1 patient (3.3 %). No patients have developed recurrent or progressive atlantoaxial instability so far.Anterior revision surgeries using the TARP system achieved reduction, decompression and fixation of C1-C2 in one stage for BI with IAAD. This technique offers an effective, simple and safe method for the revision of such cases after posterior decompression.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and
