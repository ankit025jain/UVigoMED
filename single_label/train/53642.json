{"id":53642,"title":"Local versus international recommended TSH references in the assessment of thyroid function during pregnancy.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of subclinical and overt hypothyroidism based on local population-specific reference intervals versus arbitrary cutoffs that are not specific for the population studied or the assay used, during pregnancy in an area of iodine sufficiency. We tested a total of 203 pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy, and followed their status in the second and third trimesters. Serum samples from women were assayed for levels of total T4 and T3, FT4I, TSH, TPOAb, and TgAb. Of the 203 women based on our national trimester specific reference ranges of serum TSH and FT4I, 153, 157, and 157 were euthyroid in 3 consecutive trimesters of pregnancy. Accordingly, a total of 23, 12, and 13 had subclinical hypothyroidism in the first, second, and third trimester, respectively. Overt hypothyroidism was detected in 4, 5, and 1 women in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism was 49, 31, and 34 in each of the trimesters respectively, when TSH>2.5?mIU/l was considered for definition of hypothyroidism in the first trimester, and over 3?mIU/l in the second and third trimesters. Our results showed that using arbitrary cutoff values for TSH instead of population-specific reference intervals may inappropriately increase the rate of subclinical hypothyroidism.
