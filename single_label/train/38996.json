{"id":38996,"title":"[Comparative study of morphometric parameters of the descending sigmoid sphincter according to the data of optical and virtual colonoscopy].","abstract":"Morphometric parameters of a descending sigmoid sphincter (DSS) were defined in 32 patients of both sexes aged 20-71 years (average age: 48.0 +/- 2.2 years) with various forms of colon lumen at the site of sphincter. Densitometric indices of DSS and surrounding soft tissues were estimated. Vital morphological peculiarities of descending-sigmoid junction of the colon were demonstrated, and the diameter of the colon at the level of a sphincter was defined. The data obtained confirm the anatomical character of the colon sphincters and may be used as a basis for the interpretation of optical and virtual endoscopic images and DSS description for the application in differential diagnostics and precision surgery of various colon diseases.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282823","annotations":[{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.68884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.627412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.531197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.346245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Virtual colonoscopy","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_colonoscopy"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.233715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.0296383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"2070s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2070s"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
