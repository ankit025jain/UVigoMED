{"id":81583,"title":"Videofluoroscopy of the oral phase of swallowing in eight to twelve years old children with dental malocclusion.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to describe the oral phase of swallowing in individuals with dental malocclusion and to generate data that would contribute to the rehabilitation of those patients. The study was based on the evaluation of the swallowing system through videofluoroscopy on thirty-four children of both genders, aged eight to twelve years old who present with Angle Class II and III dental malocclusions. Thirteen children of similar age and gender presenting normal dental occlusion formed the control group. The results indicated that the oral phase of swallowing is different between individuals with normal occlusion and malocclusion. Dental occlusion types Angle Class II and III did not present a swallowing pattern, independently of the amount of liquid ingested. The swallowing appeared effective in the oral phase of individuals with dental malocclusion, even though adaptations were identified. The outcome, in the absence of a single pattern and the efficiency of the adapted swallowing demonstrates, first a need for additional research investigating orofacial myofunctional treatment for patients with malocclusion and second how such analyses should focus on contributing positively to the rehabilitation of these patients.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946662","annotations":[{"name":"Gender","weight":0.344962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.286254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.216595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.0743292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0303996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Oral fixation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_fixation"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"}]}
