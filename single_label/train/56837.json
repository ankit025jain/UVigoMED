{"id":56837,"title":"Two-dimensional analysis of palpebral opening in blepharoptosis: visual iris-pupil complex percentage by digital photography.","abstract":"The vertical dimension of the palpebral fissure and the marginal reflex distance are conventionally used to assess the amount or degree of blepharoptosis, and levator function is assessed by measuring total upper lid excursion between the extremes of down-gaze and up-gaze. However, these are 1-dimensional measures obtained with a ruler, and the results obtained are dependent on examiner skill. Digital photographs were obtained of 692 patients before and after upper blepharoplasty. Visual iris-pupil complex percentage (VIP) was measured in the 1,305 eyes by digital calculation using Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems, Inc). Perioperative eye images in primary gaze were evaluated independently by 2 surgeons, 2 nurses, and a graphic designer, and after excluding 50 eyes which were nonconcordant and 29 eyes which revealed retracted upper lids, the remaining 1,305 eyes were classified into 4 major groups, that is, into excellent (n = 415), good (n = 435), subclinical (n = 270), and prominent ptosis (n = 185) groups. In addition, eyes were subdivided into 5 types according to the iris-pupil complex position within the palpebral fissure. Visual iris-pupil complex percentages were from 85% to 94% in the excellent, from 78% to 84% in the good, from 70% to 77% in the subclinical ptosis, and below 70% in the prominent ptosis group. Patients in the subclinical or prominent ptosis eye group required surgery for blepharoptosis. Iris-pupil complex relation to the palpebral opening was classified into 5 eye types, namely, standard (n = 961), scleral (n = 266), sinking (n = 151), retracted (n = 3), and fish (n = 3). The authors devised a new prospective measurement method for assessing blepharoptosis in a clinical setting. Graphical comparisons between the devised method of measuring VIP and mathematical estimations showed that the devised method is easier, more practical, and more precise for measuring degree of blepharoptosis from general population trends, and that VIP also provides a useful objective index for evaluating the postoperative results of blepharoptosis.
