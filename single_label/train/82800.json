{"id":82800,"title":"The relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease and chronic periodontitis.","abstract":"The most common cause of chronic periodontitis is poor oral hygiene. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) enhances the proximal migration of gastric contents and may cause poor oral hygiene. We hypothesized that GERD may increase the risk of chronic periodontitis and investigated this potential relationship.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatients between January 1, 2010, and April 30, 2012. GERD was defined as being present based on at least two of the following criteria: etiologic agent(s), identifiable signs and symptoms, and consistent anatomic alterations. A total of 280 patients with chronic periodontitis and 280 controls were analyzed. Information regarding patient demographics and other potential confounding factors for chronic periodontitis were collected through individual medical records.GERD was revealed to be independently associated with an increased incidence of chronic periodontitis (odds ratio [OR], 2.883; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.775 to 4.682). The other three variables of dental caries (OR, 1.531; 95% CI, 1.042 to 2.249), tobacco use (OR, 2.335; 95% CI, 1.461 to 3.730), and history of medication (calcium channel blocker, cyclosporine, or phenytoin) (OR, 2.114; 95% CI, 1.160 to 3.854) were also determined to be independent risk factors.The present study supported our hypothesis that GERD can be a risk factor for chronic periodontitis.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516699","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.90712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Phenytoin","weight":0.817494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.813248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.796601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.753635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.709923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.698854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.687199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.595758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.531498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.458907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.198984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.0573122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0289305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
