{"id":19992,"title":"[Antifungal treatment for suspected or proved candidiasis in the critically ill].","abstract":"Describe systemic antifungal therapy in non-neutropenic adult patients in intensive care unit (ICU).A prospective, observational study was conducted during the first half of 2010 in the 7 ICU in a hospital with medical consultant on antimicrobial therapy. All non-neutropenic consecutive adult patients receiving systemic antifungal therapy for documented or suspected invasive fungal infection (IFI) apart from aspergillosis were included.Out of 1502 patients admitted in ICU, 104 (7 %) underwent systemic antifungal therapy, including 30 (29 %) for a documented IFI and 74 (71 %) for a suspected IFI. Candida albicans was identified in 23 (77 %) of the IFI and 45/52 (86 %) of the broncho-pulmonary and/or urinary colonizations in suspected IFI. Echinocandin was significantly more prescribed in patients with a documented infection (19/30 patients) and fluconazole in patients with a suspected infection (48/74 patients). The first line therapy was primarily stopped after recovery (11/30 patients) or de-escalation (9/30 patients) in documented infections, and for lack of indication (34/74 patients) or due to recovery (21/74 patients) in suspected infections after on average of 7 days of treatment.For ICU non-neutropenic adult patients in our center, antifungal therapy is prescribed two times out of three for suspected, unproved infections, in most cases with fluconazole. Documented infections were more often treated by echinocandin with secondary de-escalation. An interventional prospective study to assess the role of antifungal pre-emptive or empirical therapy is necessary.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684836","annotations":[{"name":"Candidiasis","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.795511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.716628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Aspergillosis","weight":0.660996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.573412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.48582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.481533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.381513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.311611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Echinocandin","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinocandin"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Empirical treatment","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_treatment"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"1130","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1130"},{"name":"930","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/930"},{"name":"1502","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1502"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Timeout (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeout_(computing)"},{"name":"Preemption (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)"},{"name":"IFI","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFI"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Minuscule 2174","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_2174"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
