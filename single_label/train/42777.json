{"id":42777,"title":"Long-term outcome of photodynamic therapy with systemic chemotherapy compared to photodynamic therapy alone in patients with advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma.","abstract":"Patients with cholangiocarcinoma usually present at an advanced stage, and more than 50% of cases are not resectable at the time of diagnosis. Recently, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been proposed as a palliative and neoadjuvant modality. We evaluated whether combination of PDT and chemotherapy is more effective than PDT alone.In total, 161 patients with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed between February 1999 and September 2009 were evaluated. Sixteen patients were treated with PDT and chemotherapy (group A), and 58 were treated with PDT (group B).The median survival was 538 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 475.3 to 600.7) in group A and 334 days (95% CI, 252.5 to 415.5) in group B (p=0.05). Lymph node metastasis status, serum bilirubin of pretreatment, tumor node metastasis stage, treatment method (PDT with chemotherapy vs PDT alone), time to PDT and the number of PDT sessions were prognostic factors with statistical significance in the univariate analysis. A multivariate analysis showed that PDT with chemotherapy and more than two sessions of PDT were significant independent predictors of longer survival in advanced cholangiocarcinoma (hazard ratio [HR], 2.23; 95% CI, 1.18 to 4.20; p=0.013 vs HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.044 to 3.083; p=0.034).PDT with chemotherapy results in longer survival than PDT alone.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827630","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.928136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.911714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.731362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.571019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.567372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.549784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.536003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.495077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.431296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.368024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.263198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.235411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hilum (anatomy)","weight":0.227583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"538","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/538"},{"name":"252","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/252"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
