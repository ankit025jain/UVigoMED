{"id":87495,"title":"A hospital system approach at decreasing falls with injuries and cost.","abstract":"Falls and fall-related injuries continue to challenge every health care organization. Falls are a nurse-sensitive quality outcome. Patient falls are a leading cause of injuries in hospitals, considered to be among the most expensive adverse event, and continue to be a patient safety concern. Researchers analyzed the impact of a standardized fall prevention program across 50 acute care hospitals in 11 states. The implementation of a standardized multifactorial program for adult patients appears to have reduced falls with injuries by 58.3% over a 2-year period, allowing for a potential cost avoidance reduction of $776,064 in 2013 dollars.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137810","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.479459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Acute care","weight":0.325947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_care"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.244981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.137978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"776","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/776"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Tax avoidance and tax evasion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance_and_tax_evasion"},{"name":"Veterans Health Administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration"}]}
