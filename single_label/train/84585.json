{"id":84585,"title":"Spatial relationship of coronary sinus-great cardiac vein with adjoining anatomic structures: a key element in predicting the success of percutaneous transvenous mitral annuloplasty.","abstract":"Knowledge of the anatomy of the coronary venous system and its relationship with the mitral valve annulus (MVA) and coronary arteries is a key element to successful percutaneous transvenous mitral annuloplasty (PTMA) device implantation for treating patients with severe mitral regurgitation.The spatial relationship of the coronary sinus-great cardiac vein (CS-GCV) with the MVA, left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) and its branches was examined in 120 formalin-fixed adult human cadaveric hearts.During the initial part of its journey, the CS-GCV was seen to course along and parallel to the plane of the MVA in 109 cases (90.8%), and to cross the MVA obliquely in 11 cases (9.2%). The LCx crossed deep or superficial to the CS-GCV at a discrete point in 98 cases (81.6%) and in eight cases (6.6%), respectively. In two cases (1.6%), the LCx was overlapped by the CS-GCV for an average length of 3.5 +/- 0.7 cm, and in five cases (4.1%) it lay superficial to the CS-GCV for an average length of 3.1 +/- 1.0 cm. In the remaining seven cases (5.8%), the artery did not accompany the CS-GCV along the MVA. Obtuse marginal arteries and the ramus intermedius were seen coursing deep to the CS-GCV in 40 cases (33.3%) and 33 cases (27.5%), respectively.The study results showed that the CS-GCV crosses the annulus obliquely in 9.2% of cases, and hence might affect the efficiency of PTMA. Similarly, positioning of the annuloplasty device in the CS-GCV in cases where the LCx and its branches lay deep to the vein may result in an impingement of the arteries, leading to ischemia.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076549","annotations":[{"name":"Circumflex branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.896071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.874058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Circumflex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex"},{"name":"PTMA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTMA"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Classical element","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Branch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch"},{"name":"Fixed-wing aircraft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing_aircraft"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Volt-ampere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt-ampere"},{"name":"Ramus of the mandible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramus_of_the_mandible"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc annuloplasty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc_annuloplasty"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Coursing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursing"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Laity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
