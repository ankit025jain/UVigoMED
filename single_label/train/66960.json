{"id":66960,"title":"Expression of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1) gene in prostate cancer: clinical and biological significance.","abstract":"Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type-1 (HAI-1) is an integral-membrane proteinase inhibitor. Some studies have shown that HAI-1 as a matriptase inhibitor that plays a significant role in regulating cancer progression and metastasis. In this study, we attempted to clarify whether the levels of HAI-1 could be a useful marker in patients with prostate cancer (Pca).HAI-1 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HAI-1 mRNA was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 48 patients with Pca and 20 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The association between HAI-1 and clinicopathological features and survival were analyzed.A high level of HAI-1 protein and mRNA expression was detected in BPH compared to Pca specimens. The HAI-1 expression inversely correlated with Gleason score and pathological stage (p<0.05). It was significantly stronger in N0M0 tumors than in N+ or M+ tumors (p<0.05). Furthermore, low HAI-1 expression was a significant predictor for poor prognosis when compared with high HAI-1 expression (disease-free survival/DFS rate, p=0.0487; overall survival/ OS rate; p=0.0492).The results of the present study identified HAI-1 as a favorable prognostic marker for Pca and may indicate that HAI-1 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of this malignancy.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659667","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.882393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.597426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.520308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.295642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.102962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0574572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hepatocyte growth factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte_growth_factor"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
