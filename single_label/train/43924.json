{"id":43924,"title":"Increased activated natural killer T cells in the liver of patients with advanced stage primary biliary cirrhosis.","abstract":"Although growing evidence suggests a major role for T cells in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), the roles of natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells, which predominate in the liver, in the pathogenesis of PBC remain unclear. We investigated the status of NK and NKT cells in the liver and peripheral blood samples obtained from 11 patients with asymptomatic PBC diagnosed as stage I or II (early PBC) and 7 patients with symptomatic PBC who underwent liver transplantation (advanced PBC) using flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining. The proportions of NK and NKT cells were significantly decreased in the liver of patients with early PBC compared with normal donors. However, the proportion of CD56+ NKT cells was increased in the liver of patients with advanced PBC. Moreover, the proportion of activated Fas ligand (FasL)-positive NKT cells was significantly increased in the liver of patients with advanced PBC compared with early PBC (P=0.013). We also found increased expression of FasL on lymphocytes infiltrating around the injured bile duct in advanced PBC using immunohistochemical staining. Our results suggest that activated NKT cells may contribute to the biliary epithelial cell death resulting in the progression of PBC.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24759184","annotations":[{"name":"Primary biliary cirrhosis","weight":0.899091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_biliary_cirrhosis"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.779394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.754566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.735016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.7246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.622707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Natural Killer T cell","weight":0.488472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Killer_T_cell"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Fas ligand","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_ligand"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"}]}
