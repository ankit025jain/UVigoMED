{"id":45098,"title":"Noncontrast MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging as the sole imaging modality for detecting liver malignancy in patients with high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"To compare the diagnostic performance of the noncontrast MRI including DWI to the standard MRI for detecting hepatic malignancies in patients with chronic liver disease.We included 135 patients with 136 histologically-confirmed hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), 12 cholangiocarcinomas, and 34 benign lesions (? 2.0 cm), and 22 patients with cirrhosis but no focal liver lesion who underwent 3.0 T liver MRI. Noncontrast MRI set (T1- and T2-weighted images and DWI) and standard MRI set (gadoxetic acid-enhanced and noncontrast MRI) were analyzed independently by three observers to detect liver malignancies using receiver operating characteristic analysis.The Az value of the noncontrast MRI (mean, 0.906) was not inferior to that of the combined MRI (mean, 0.924) for detecting malignancies by all observers (P>0.05). For each observer, no significant difference was found in the sensitivity and specificity between the two MRI sets for detecting liver malignancies and distinguishing them from benign lesions (P>0.05), whereas negative predictive value was higher with the combined MRI than with the noncontrast MRI (P=0.0001). When using pooled data, the sensitivity of the combined MRI (mean 94.8%) was higher than that of the noncontrast MRI (mean, 91.7%) (P =0.001), whereas specificity was equivalent (78.6% vs 77.5%).Noncontrast MRI including DWI showed reasonable performance compared to the combined gadoxetic acid-enhanced and noncontrast MRI set for detecting HCC and cholangiocarcinoma and differentiating them from benign lesions in patients with chronic liver disease.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702980","annotations":[{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.797488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.590223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.371491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Relaxation (NMR)","weight":0.280041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(NMR)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.127283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Driving under the influence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
