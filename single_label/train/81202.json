{"id":81202,"title":"Full-mouth esthetic rehabilitation with acellular dermal matrix.","abstract":"Treatment of multiple recession defects with the adjunct use of a connective tissue graft (CTG) represents a challenge when diagnosed in several teeth of the mouth. The amount of CTG harvested from the palate may not be adequate to address this condition. In such scenarios, alternative sources such as acellular dermal matrix (ADM) are preferred due to the unlimited availability. A case report is presented, dealing with the treatment of multiple gingival recessions affecting the majority of dentition using ADM, with a 6-month follow-up.
