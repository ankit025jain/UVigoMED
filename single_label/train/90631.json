{"id":90631,"title":"Anterior dislocation of the shoulder in skeletally immature patients: comparison between non-operative treatment versus open Latarjet's procedure.","abstract":"The ideal treatment for traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder in the skeletally immature patient is controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes after either conservative and/or surgical treatment using the Latarjet technique. A retrospective series of 49 out of 80 patients were reviewed. We found no significant differences between either treatment method regarding functional scores and pain levels. Although not statistically significant, post-surgical patients showed better signs of shoulder stability than others who have a higher rate of recurrence. Further, 92% of the post-surgical group had returned to the same level of activity versus 52% in the non-surgically treated group. We found no contraindications to operate on a skeletally immature patient.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589791","annotations":[{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.672857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.550962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.403867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.2499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.242852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0634039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
