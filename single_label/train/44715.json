{"id":44715,"title":"Adenocarcinoma arising in gastric heterotopic pancreas. Case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"A sixty years-old patient was admitted with a gastric tumor corresponding to an adenocarcinoma developed in ectopic pancreatic tissue. Hundred cases of gastric heterotopic pancreas are shown in literature. This entity may remain asymptomatic. Symptoms such abdominal pain are described as the result of tumour growth. Carcinogenesis of ectopic pancreas (EPa) is however rare. Diagnosis is rarely pre-operative because modern imaging depicts a gastric tumour with no more information. The only treatment is surgery, with a best interest in frozen sections to direct the procedure, in this case a total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Based on this case report, an analysis of the literature focusing on diagnosis and treatment is presented.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720145","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.535957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.514324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.343833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.179746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Frozen section procedure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_section_procedure"},{"name":"Freezing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing"},{"name":"Best interests","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_interests"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
