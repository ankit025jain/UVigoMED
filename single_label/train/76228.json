{"id":76228,"title":"Early infant feeding practice and childhood obesity: the relation of breast-feeding and timing of solid food introduction with childhood obesity.","abstract":"We assessed the association of breast-feeding and timing of solid food introduction with childhood obesity.The children were grouped according to the duration of breast-feeding (0-1, 2-6, 7-12, 13-18, and 19-24 months) and the age at which solid foods were introduced (<4, 4-5, and ?6 months).In this study, we enrolled 4990 children aged 2-14 years. The rate of exclusive breast-feeding at 6 months of age was 49.1%. We found no association between the duration of breast-feeding and childhood obesity [odds ratio (OR) 0.948, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.694-1.295]. The regression analysis revealed no significant differences in obesity or overweight rates between the early and late introduction to solid food groups (OR 0.993, 95% CI 0.645-1.531).Although breastfeeding has been previously reported to protect against childhood obesity, we were unable to find a significant association between obesity and either longer duration of breastfeeding or later introduction to solid foods in our sample.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25153224","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.892542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.517308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.508606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.393022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.122673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"531","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/531"},{"name":"712","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/712"},{"name":"948","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/948"},{"name":"1318","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1318"},{"name":"993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/993"},{"name":"295","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/295"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Food group","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_group"}]}
