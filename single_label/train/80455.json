{"id":80455,"title":"Serodiagnosis of Schistosoma japonicum infection: genome-wide identification of a protein marker, and assessment of its diagnostic validity in a field study in China.","abstract":"Schistosomiasis remains a highly prevalent and serious parasitic disease. A major factor preventing its effective management is the scarcity of effective diagnostic tools. We did a genome-wide identification of diagnostic protein markers for schistosome infection and assessed their diagnostic validity in a field study.We predicted putative secreted proteins of Schistosoma japonicum (SjSPs) and expressed them as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were arrayed on glutathione (GSH)-immobilised microplates and screened with serum samples from patients with schistosomiasis diagnosed by the Kato-Katz method. We further assessed an identified protein marker for sensitivity and specificity, first in infected serum samples collected from Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces, China, and then through a field study, done in two villages located in a high schistosomiasis-endemic area of the southeast of China.Of 204 recombinant proteins, 35 yielded seropositive reactions, eight showed strong immunoreactivity, and only one (SjSP-13) reacted to the entire panel of 14 archived samples. The reactivity of SjSP-13 to 476 serum samples showed 90·4% (95% CI 86·5-93·5) sensitivity and 98·9% (95% CI 95·9-99·9) specificity. Of 1371 residents enrolled in a field study from Dec 6, 2010, to June 23, 2011, only 74 individuals were identified as being egg-positive, whereas 465 were diagnosed as positive by the SjSP-13-based ELISA kit (rSP13-ELISA). Of the 394 individuals found egg-negative but rSP13-ELISA-positive, 363 (92·4%) were confirmed to be positive for schistosome infection by PCR detection of S japonicum SjR2 retrotransposon.The application of this sensitive, specific, and affordable rSP13-ELISA method should help reduce schistosomiasis transmission through targeted treatment of individuals, particularly with low intensity infections, and therefore support schistosomiasis control and elimination strategies.National 973 project in China.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656567","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Retrotransposon","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.806321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Parasitic disease","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.703174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"China","weight":0.668012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.566066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.229301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hunan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"June 23","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_23"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Microtiter plate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtiter_plate"},{"name":"Hunger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
