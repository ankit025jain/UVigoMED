{"id":51336,"title":"Increased fasting glucose and the prevalence of arterial stiffness: a cross-sectional study in Chinese adults.","abstract":"Previous studies have shown that diabetes increases the prevalence of arterial stiffness. However, it remains controversial whether impaired fasting glucose (IFG), a key pre-diabetes condition, is associated with increased risk of arterial stiffness. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between increased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and the prevalence of arterial stiffness in a Chinese adult population.A random sample of 5039 participants aged 40 years or older (40.0% female) were enrolled in this study. Information on potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease was collected, and the presence of arterial stiffness was assessed by measuring brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). Participants were stratified into three groups: normal fasting glucose (NFG), IFG, and diabetes mellitus (DM). The IFG group was further stratified by quartiles based on the level of FPG into Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.Fasting plasma glucose level was found to be independently and positively associated with baPWV. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for arterial stiffness were 1.09 (0.80-1.48), 1.33 (0.98-1.81), 1.27 (0.93-1.73), 1.82 (1.31-2.53), and 2.15 (1.66-2.79) for those in IFG Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and DM groups compared with NFG group (P < 0.001), respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, and other potential confounders. Moreover, male participants and participants younger than 60 years were closely associated with the presence and severity of arterial stiffness (P < 0.001).Our study reports a previously unidentified positive association between increased FPG and the prevalence of arterial stiffness, suggesting the importance of FPG control in the prevention of arterial stiffness.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702596","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular
