{"id":28490,"title":"Skin testing only with penicillin G in children with a history of penicillin allergy.","abstract":"The absence of commercially available penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL) for most of the last decade severely hampered the practice of penicillin allergy evaluation because skin testing without PPL is reported to have a poor negative predictive value (NPV).To determine the safety and NPV of skin testing without PPL using only penicillin G followed by a 3-dose graded challenge to the incriminated penicillin in children with a history of penicillin allergy.Patients evaluated for a history of penicillin allergy at the CHU Sainte-Justine Allergy Clinic between December 2006 and December 2009 were skin tested only with penicillin G and underwent a 3-dose graded challenge to the culprit penicillin if the skin test result was negative.Among 563 patients skin tested to penicillin G, 185 (33%) had a positive skin test result. These patients had a shorter interval between the initial reaction and skin testing compared with patients with a negative skin test result (PÂ = .03). A total of 375 of 378 patients (99%) with a negative skin test result were challenged and 18 (4.8%) reacted, translating into a NPV of 95.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.5%-97.1%). Three of 17 patients with a history of anaphylaxis and a negative skin test result reacted to challenge (NPV, 82.4%; 95% CI, 59.0-93.8%). All challenge reactions were mild and resolved promptly with treatment.Among children with a history of penicillin allergy, skin testing only with penicillin G followed by a 3-dose graded challenge to the incriminated penicillin is safe and yields a good NPV. This approach could be useful when PPL is unavailable.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856884","annotations":[{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.819171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Penicillin","weight":0.788616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.314423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Benzylpenicillin","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzylpenicillin"},{"name":"378","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/378"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"597","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/597"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"375","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/375"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Culprit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culprit"},{"name":"Christian Historical Union","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Historical_Union"},{"name":"Net present value","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"}]}
