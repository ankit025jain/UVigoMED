{"id":91538,"title":"[Current situation and reflection on rehabilitation after burn injury in China].","abstract":"After over 50 years' development, the modern burn care system of China has made remarkable progress, however, we still lack ample attention to functional rehabilitation and quality of life of burn patients recovering from burn injury. The burn rehabilitation in China is still in juvenile stage, but it is really encouraging that more and more burn care facilities are paying attention to it. To further promote the development of burn rehabilitation in China, more emphasis must be stressed on the formation of multidisciplinary team in our burn care system, the concept of early and integral rehabilitation should be promoted, and therapeutic regimens and research work on function and aesthetics related body parts like hand and face should be emphasized. Moreover, we should also carry out rehabilitation on pediatric burn patients and promulgate the idea of burn rehabilitation in the society at large with the purpose of seeking supports for burn rehabilitation from all sectors of the society.
