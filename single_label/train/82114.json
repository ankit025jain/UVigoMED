{"id":82114,"title":"Dentoskeletal effects of Class II malocclusion treatment with the Twin Block appliance in a Brazilian sample: a prospective study.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the dentoskeletal effects of Class II malocclusion treatment performed with the Twin Block appliance.The experimental group comprised 20 individuals with initial mean age of 11.76 years and treated for a period of 1.13 years. The control group comprised 25 individuals with initial mean age of 11.39 years and a follow-up period of 1.07 years. Lateral cephalograms were taken at treatment onset and completion to assess treatment outcomes. Intergroup comparison was performed by means of the chi-square and independent t tests.The Twin Block appliance did not show significant effects on the maxillary component. The mandibular component showed a statistically significant increase in the effective mandibular length (Co-Gn) and significant improvement in the maxillomandibular relationship. The maxillary and mandibular dentoalveolar components presented a significant inclination of anterior teeth in both arches. The maxillary incisors were lingually tipped and retruded, while the mandibular incisors were labially tipped and protruded.The Twin Block appliance has great effectiveness for correction of skeletal Class II malocclusion in individuals with growth potential. Most changes are of dentoalveolar nature with a large component of tooth inclination associated with a significant skeletal effect on the mandible.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713558","annotations":[{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.851112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.553583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.518596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.427349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Malocclusion","weight":0.193164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.112243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Roundedness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundedness"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"The Twin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twin"},{"name":"Intergroups in the European Parliament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergroups_in_the_European_Parliament"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Pharyngeal arch","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_arch"}]}
