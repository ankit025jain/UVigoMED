{"id":83211,"title":"Effect of the clinical application of the diode laser (810 nm) in the treatment of dentine hypersensitivity.","abstract":"Dentine hypersensitivity is a common clinical finding with a wide variation in prevalence values. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of diode laser (810 nm) in the treatment of cervical dentine hypersensitivity.Five patients, with at least two sensitive teeth were selected. A total of 14 teeth were included in this trial. By using Visual Analogous Scale the pain of dentine hyper sensitivity was detected and the pre- treatment readings were recorded.The Diode laser (810 nm), was irradiated on (non contact) mode at the cervical region.The samples were divided into two groups according to exposure duration: For Group 1 exposure duration was 30 seconds and for group 2 exposure duration was one minute.The efficiency of the treatment was assessed at two examination period :15 minutes after first application and 7 days after first application, the degree of sensitivity was determined by using Visual Analogous Scale.The results show significant reduction of pain after 15 minutes of laser application in the group with 30 seconds exposure duration (P = .001), and the pain completely fade away after one week in the same group, while in the group with 1 minute exposure duration the pain completely disappeared (visual analogous scale = (0)) after 15 minutes and one week of laser application (P = 0.001).The study concluded that application of diode laser (810 nm) was effective for the reduction of dentine hypersensitivity.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Stomatognathic
