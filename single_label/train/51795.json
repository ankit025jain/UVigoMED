{"id":51795,"title":"Effect of body mass index on in vitro fertilization outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.","abstract":"The objective of the investigation was to study the effect of body mass index (BMI) on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes within a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) population.This was a retrospective cohort study including 101 cycles from 79 women younger than 40 years old with a clinically documented diagnosis of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria undergoing IVF at a university-based infertility clinic from 2001 through 2010. All participants were stratified by BMI calculated from height and weight recorded within 3 months of cycle start: lean (18.7-24.9 kg/m(2), n = 51), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m(2), n = 19), and obese (?30 kg/m(2), n = 31). Linear, logistic, and Poisson regressions were used as appropriate to estimate the effect of a range of BMIs on IVF outcomes while adjusting for potential confounders.Obese PCOS women had 69% lower odds of clinical pregnancy per cycle start (odds ratio [OR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.86; P = .02) and 77% lower odds of clinical pregnancy per embryo transfer (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.68; P = .008) compared with lean PCOS women. Among obese PCOS women, the odds of live birth were 71% lower per cycle start (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.84; P = .02) and 77% lower per embryo transfer (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.71; P = .01) compared with lean PCOS women. There was a trend toward decreased ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome incidence with increasing BMI among women with PCOS: 19.6% in lean, 10.5% in overweight, and 3.2% in obese.PCOS is a broad syndrome, with our results demonstrating 2 distinct populations, lean and obese, which have different IVF outcomes including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome risk profiles. This information is important for clinicians because it informs treatment decisions.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657792","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.844401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Embryo transfer","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_transfer"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.685901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.650393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.569944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.447351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.343345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.330756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.3065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation_syndrome"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation","weight":0.160494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Vivipary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivipary"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
