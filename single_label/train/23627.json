{"id":23627,"title":"Potential impact of a microarray-based nucleic acid assay for rapid detection of Gram-negative bacteria and resistance markers in positive blood cultures.","abstract":"We evaluated the Verigene Gram-negative blood culture (BC-GN) test, a microarray that detects Gram-negative bacteria and several resistance genes. A total of 102 positive blood cultures were tested, and the BC-GN test correctly identified 97.9% of the isolates within its panel. Resistance genes (CTX-M, KPC, VIM, and OXA genes) were detected in 29.8% of the isolates, with positive predictive values of 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.7% to 98.9%) in Enterobacteriaceae and 100% (95% CI, 75.9% to 100%) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and negative predictive values of 100% (95% CI, 93.9% to 100%) and 78.6% (95% CI, 51.0% to 93.6%), respectively.
