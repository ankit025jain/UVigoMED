{"id":65423,"title":"Palliative radiotherapy for prostate cancer.","abstract":"Radiotherapy is an effective tool for the palliation of symptoms commonly caused by prostate cancer. The majority of painful bone metastases respond equally well to single or multiple fractions of external radiotherapy. Retreatment with a second course of radiation induces pain responses in approximately 50% of patients. For more diffuse metastases, either hemibody radiation or systemic radiopharmaceuticals can reduce pain, and radium-223 is associated with improved survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Hematuria, bladder outlet obstruction, and rectal compression are all improved with palliative radiotherapy. The ability of stereotactic body radiation therapy to reduce pain compared with standard external radiation is being investigated, as is its role in treating those with limited metastatic disease.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839802","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Radium","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.795841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Radiopharmacology","weight":0.428067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiopharmacology"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.359055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Electromagnetic radiation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.0508684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"}]}
