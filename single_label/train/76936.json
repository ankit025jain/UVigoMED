{"id":76936,"title":"Family-based childhood obesity interventions in the UK: a systematic review of published studies.","abstract":"Family-based programmes that emphasise lifestyle and behaviour change using psychological principles have been shown to be effective in targeting childhood obesity. While there is some evidence that evaluates UK family-based obesity interventions at a local level, no review to date has addressed this nationally. This review presents the available evidence from UK family-based childhood obesity interventions. Ten articles that met the inclusion criteria were included for review. The majority of programmes reviewed lasted 12 weeks, with only three studies providing follow-up data at 12 months or longer. Change in adiposity may be a short-term benefit of participation in a child weight management programme, but there is insufficient robust evidence to indicate that this benefit is long lasting and many studies were methodologically weak with limited internal validity. There is insufficient evidence to suggest how the inclusion of parents and the wider family may impact on the effectiveness of UK community based weight management programme for children and young people.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881194","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.661831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.203312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.164981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.137394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.10542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Applied psychology","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_psychology"},{"name":"Internal validity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_validity"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Legal burden of proof","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof"},{"name":"Network Ten","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Ten"},{"name":"Behavior change (public health)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_change_(public_health)"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Weight management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_management"}]}
