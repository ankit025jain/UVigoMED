{"id":64860,"title":"[Pathogens in expressed prostatic secretion and their correlation with serum prostate specific antigen: analysis of 320 cases].","abstract":"To investigate the pathogenic infection and its drug resistance in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) and its correlation with serum PSA, and provide some evidence for the systematic and normalized diagnosis and treatment of prostatitis.Three EPS swabs were collected from each of the 320 prostatis patients following measurement of the serum PSA level, 1 for bacterial culture and identification, 1 for detection of Mycoplasma and drug sensitivity, and the other for examination of Chlamydia trachomatis antigen by colloidal gold immunoblot.Totally 244 strains were isolated from the 320 EPS samples, including 188 bacterial strains (dominated by Staphylococcus and sensitive to vancomycin or linezolid) and 44 Mycoplasma and Chlamydia strains (mainly Ureaplasma urealyticum and susceptible to josamycin or doxycycline). The serum PSA level was significantly higher in the pathogen-positive than in the pathogen-negative group ([6.98 +/- 0.56] microg/L vs [2.32 +/- 0.12] microg/L, P < 0.05).Prostatitis may lead to the elevation of the serum PSA level and the pathogens involved vary in their resistance to different antibacterial spectrums. Therefore, appropriate and individualized antibiotic therapy should be selected according to etiological diagnosis and the results of drug sensitivity test.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195368","annotations":[{"name":"Chlamydia trachomatis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydia_trachomatis"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Ureaplasma urealyticum","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureaplasma_urealyticum"},{"name":"Doxycycline","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxycycline"},{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Chlamydia infection","weight":0.84024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydia_infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.701997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.659456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.634678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.623583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.62066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.567905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.435293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ureaplasma","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureaplasma"},{"name":"Linezolid","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linezolid"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.309714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.275402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
