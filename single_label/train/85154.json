{"id":85154,"title":"Sevoflurane as a therapy for acute chlorine gas exposure in an austere healthcare environment: a case report.","abstract":"Chlorine is a common agent found worldwide in industrial and household applications. This element is found everywhere and anywhere around the globe. Because of its ubiquitous nature in the world, chlorine-injured patients may be expected at all medical facilities, from large-urban to small-community to austere-tent facilities. Chlorine has been used as a chemical weapon since 1915 and has been accidentally released in transport, storage, and use, causing industrial accidents worldwide. A patient with a history of severe chlorine inhalational injury sustained 2 chlorine gas exposures within 48 hours. The patient was treated with intubation, mechanical ventilation, and directed therapies for severe injury by chlorine gas inhalation. Sevoflurane has a role in treating chlorine inhalation injury. Additional therapies are possible, some of which are not available in remote locations.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109161","annotations":[{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.872594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.646318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.408333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.406857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.402379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.18647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.171139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Chemical weapon","weight":0.118876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapon"},{"name":"Sevoflurane","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevoflurane"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Warehouse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse"},{"name":"List of industrial disasters","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_industrial_disasters"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Earth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"}]}
