{"id":69470,"title":"MiR-320a down-regulation mediates bladder carcinoma invasion by targeting ITGB3.","abstract":"To investigate whether the miR-320a could regulate bladder cancer cells invasion by down-regulation of ITGB3. Real-time quantitative PCR was applied to evaluate the expression level of miRNA-320a in bladder transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) and normal bladder transitional cell (NBTC) samples. The invasion ability of miR-320a in TCC T24 cells was analyzed by Transwell assay after pre-miR-320a or anti-miR-125b transfection. For the invasion mechanism analysis of miR-320a on T24 cells, TargetScan, PicTar and miRBase were used to predict the possible target gene of miR-320a. Luciferase activities assay and western blot were used to reveal the predicted target gene of miR-320a were direct and specific. RNA interference technology was used to confirm the invasion inhibition of miR-320a was directly induced by ITGB3. Our study showed that miR-320a was down-regulated in human TCC specimens compared to that in NBTC specimens. Over-expression of miR-320a in T24 cells inhibited TCC invasion and this inhibitory effect on T24 cells could be restore by miR-320a knocked down. Mechanism analysis revealed that ITGB3 was a direct and specific target of miR-320a. The advanced effect of anti-miR-320a on TCC cell invasion was mediated by expression silence of ITGB3. In summary, aberrantly expressed miR-320a contribute to T24 cells invasion partly through directly down-regulating ITGB3 protein expression in TCC and this miRNA signature offers a novel potential therapeutic strategy for TCC.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443232","annotations":[{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.568304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.457171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.222286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.143621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Protein structure prediction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
