{"id":13416,"title":"Aggravation of seizure-like events by hydrogen sulfide: involvement of multiple targets that control neuronal excitability.","abstract":"Epileptic seizures are well-known neurological complications following stroke, occurring in 3% of patients. However, the intrinsic correlation of seizures with stroke remains largely unknown. Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) is a gas transmitter that may mediate cerebral ischemic injury. But the role of H2 S in seizures has not been understood yet. We examined the effect of H2 S on seizure-like events (SLEs) and underlying mechanisms.Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)- and pilocarpine-induced rat epileptic seizure models were tested. Low-Mg(2+) /high-K(+) - and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced epileptic seizure models were examined using patch-clamp recordings in brain slices. It was found that NaHS aggravated both PTZ- and pilocarpine-induced SLEs in rats, while both low-Mg(2+) /high-K(+) - and 4-AP-induced SLEs were also exacerbated by NaHS in brain slices, which may be due to its regulation on the voltage-gated sodium channel, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR), and ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) function. Furthermore, these effects were reversed by blocking voltage-gated sodium channel, NMDAR, and AMPAR.These results suggest a pathological role of increased H2 S level in SLEs in vivo and in vitro. Enzymes that control H2 S biosynthesis could be interesting targets for antiepileptic strategies in poststroke epilepsy treatment.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479764","annotations":[{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Sodium channel","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_channel"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.782119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.740667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"NMDA receptor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.659502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"AMPA receptor","weight":0.596123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPA_receptor"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.539043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.504047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.401131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Hydrogen sulfide","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide"},{"name":"Sulfide","weight":0.143958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfide"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
