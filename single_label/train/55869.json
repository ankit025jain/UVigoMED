{"id":55869,"title":"Age-related macular degeneration and cognitive impairment show similarities in changes of neutral lipids in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.","abstract":"Starting from previous studies showing that patients with cognitive deficit present neutral lipids (NLs) accumulation in cytoplasm of their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and considering that there is epidemiological evidence linking age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to cognitive deficit, the first purpose of this study was to test whether neutral lipids also accumulated in PBMCs from AMD subjects. Moreover, the impact of statin use on AMD was explored and whether such use in AMD subjects was associated with NLs accumulation in PBMCs. The study was conducted on 222 subjects: 136 AMD (36 of which - 26.5% - using statins], 48 cognitive deficit (20 of which - 41.7% - using statins) and 38 healthy controls (4 of whichÂ -10.1% - using statins), AMD lesions were assessed from color fundus photographs. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), demographics, lifestyle factors and medical history were collected at interview. MMSE score was categorized as normal (24-30), and impaired (<24), NLs content was evaluated by oil red 0 (ORO) staining method. ORO determination showed that neutral lipids were generally absent or very low (score between 0 and 1) in healthy controls while most of PBMCs from cognitive deficit and AMD had ORO staining levels scoring 2-4. Post hoc analysis (Bonferroni) in a one-way ANOVA revealed that ORO score was significantly higher in cognitive deficit and AMD subjects compared to healthy controls and in cognitive deficit compared to AMD. Bonferroni-test also showed that AMD subjects had significantly lower total cholesterol (TC) levels compared to healthy controls while high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) did not reach statistical significance. The results also revealed a significant higher number of statin-users in AMD compared to healthy controls. Likewise when cognitive deficit vs healthy controls was analyzed, the number of statin users were found to be significant higher in cognitive deficit than in healthy controls. There were no significant differences in statin use between AMD and cognitive deficit. Compared to healthy controls, statin use in cognitive deficit and AMD groups was significantly associated with ORO scores of 2-4. This data supports the hypothesis that AMD and cognitive deficit share similar complex pathophysiology and risk factors including NLs accumulation in their PBMCs, although this does not necessarily imply that one disease causes the other. In addition, they provide further evidence that statin use may increase the risk of AMD.
