{"id":69131,"title":"Therapeutic modulation of prostate cancer metastasis.","abstract":"Targeting prostate cancer metastasis has very high therapeutic potential. Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death among men in the USA, and death results from the development of metastatic disease. In order to metastasize, cancer cells must complete a series of steps that together constitute the metastatic cascade. Each step therefore offers the opportunity for therapeutic targeting. However, practical limitations have served as limiting roadblocks to successfully targeting the metastatic cascade. They include our still-emerging understanding of the underlying biology, as well as the fact that many of the dysregulated processes have critical functionality in otherwise normal cells. We provide a discussion of the underlying biology, as it relates to therapeutic targeting. Therapeutic inroads are rapidly being made, and we present a series of case studies to highlight key points. Finally, future perspectives related to drug discovery for antimetastatic agents are discussed.
