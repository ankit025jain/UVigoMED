{"id":85717,"title":"Evidence-based outcomes from pulmonary rehabilitation in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient.","abstract":"The aim of this article is to appraise the quality of evidence reported for important outcomes in pulmonary rehabilitation using the approach of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group. This appraisal was carried out by identifying Cochrane systematic reviews and systematic reviews that have been subsequently reported since the last Cochrane report. The focus of this appraisal was to determine the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation programs versus control therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. This analysis did not evaluate other aspects of the pulmonary rehabilitation intervention.
