{"id":18889,"title":"[Exudative onycholysis and acute bacterial paronychia related to BIBF-1120 and paclitaxel: response to topical therapy].","abstract":"A case of a 50 years-old breast cancer patient treated with weekly paclitaxel and BIBF 1120 is reported herein. At the end of the twelfth cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed distal onycholysis with intense hyponychium serous exudates, pain and malodor in all her fingernails. It was treated with topical fusidic acid and 1% methylprednisolone aceponate two times daily, with an excellent clinical response from the first three days of treatment. Bacterial paronychia with nail plate loss of the fifth left fingernail was observed a week after the topical therapy was started, with positive cultures for Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. There are few reported cases of exudative onycholysis associated with chemotherapy. However, these are especially related to paclitaxel. No recurrences of nail disturbances were observed weeks after the end of chemotherapy. Topical corticosteroids and fusidic acid could be considered as a therapeutic option when exudative onycholysis related to paclitaxel is established","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758102","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.86885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Methylprednisolone","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylprednisolone"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Fusidic acid","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusidic_acid"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.75769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.611167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.492889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Paronychia","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paronychia"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.433004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.385833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.260052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.238417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.205114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.119465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Onycholysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onycholysis"},{"name":"Nail plate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_plate"},{"name":"Meticillin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meticillin"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"}]}
