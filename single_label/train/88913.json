{"id":88913,"title":"Facial nerve injury during temporal artery biopsy.","abstract":"Temporal artery biopsy is considered the gold standard investigation of giant cell arteritis and is recommended in suspected cases despite a sensitivity of 81-91%. This review highlights the potential risk of facial nerve injury during temporal artery biopsy and introduces recent advances in the emerging role of imaging modalities. When these non-invasive techniques are used in conjunction with American College of Rheumatology scoring, which includes clinical features and biochemical test results, temporal artery biopsy may be avoided in selected cases.
