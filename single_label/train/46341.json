{"id":46341,"title":"The prognostic significance of surgically treated hydrocephalus in leptomeningeal metastases.","abstract":"The median survival of leptomeningeal metastases is short despite therapy and is sometime associated with hydrocephalus. We investigated the prognostic significance of surgically treated hydrocephalus in leptomeningeal metastases.Between December 2005 and November 2012, 1343 patients had brain metastases from systemic solid tumors. Of these, 71 patients (5.3%) experienced leptomeningeal metastases from 45 lung cancers, 14 breast cancers, 4 gastric cancers and 8 other cancers. The mean age was 60 years (range 37-89). The clinical symptoms presented in the cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum in 58 patients, cranial nerve in 7 patients and spinal cord and nerves in 6 patients. Twenty-nine (40.8%) patients were Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG-RPA) class II and 42 (59.2%) were class III. Hydrocephalus was associated in 18 (25.4%) patients and 7 patients underwent ventriculoperioneal shunt. The primary cancer, clinical symptoms, RTOG-RPA class, surgically treated hydrocephalus and systemic chemotherapy were analyzed as the prognostic factors for overall survival.The overall incidence of leptomeningeal seeding was 5.0% of the brain metastases. The median duration of leptomeningeal metastases from first brain metastasis was 4.0 months and 24 (33.8%) patients showed leptomeningeal metastases as the first form of brain metastasis. The median overall survival (OS) was 2.1 months. Based on the univariate and multivariate analyses, RTOG-RPA class II patients, treatment of leptomeningeal metastases (such as radiotherapy or intrathecal chemotherapy) and systemic chemotherapy improved OS with statistical significance. Surgically untreated hydrocephalus (median OS, 1.7 months) showed poor OS compared with surgically treated hydrocephalus (median OS, 5.7 months) and no hydrocephalus (median OS, 2.3 months) without statistical significance.The leptomeningeal metastases were often associated with hydrocephalus and the surgical treatment was helpful in limited patients. The prognosis was related with RTOG-RPA class and treatment of local and systemic treatment.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635931","annotations":[{"name":"Cerebellum","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Intrathecal","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrathecal"},{"name":"Cerebral hemisphere","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"},{"name":"Cranial nerve","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_nerve"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Brain metastasis","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Meninges","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.685161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.683353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.65997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.54504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.520478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.447982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.287909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.225821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.145994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
