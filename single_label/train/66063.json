{"id":66063,"title":"Outcomes and predictive factors of prostate cancer patients with extremely high prostate-specific antigen level.","abstract":"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a useful biomarker of prostate cancer (PCa). High-risk localized PCa is defined using T stage, Gleason score (GS), and PSA. However, PSA level defining high-risk PCa is at most 20 ng/mL. In PCa patients with high PSA, it is unclear whether PSA itself can be a prognostic factor.Of 642 patients who were diagnosed as PCa, 90 patients with PSA > 100 ng/mL were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into three groups according to PSA level: very high (>1,000 ng/mL), moderately high (200-1,000 ng/mL), and slightly high (100-200 ng/mL).There were no significant differences in overall survival or PCa-specific survival (PCaSS) among the three groups. Regardless of PSA level, high M stage and GS significantly reduced PCaSS. When the risk classification was made using M stage and GS (high risk = M1 and GS ? 9, low risk = M0 and GS < 9, and intermediate risk = others), PCaSS was significantly different among high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups with 5-year survival rates of 58.2, 80.6, and 100 %, respectively. Although there were no differences in treatment performed during the castration-resistant stage, patients undergoing alternative anti-androgen and zoledronic acid treatment had better PCaSS after being castration-resistant.As PSA could not be a prognostic factor in PCa patients with high PSA > 100 ng/mL, the novel risk classification using M stage and GS may help clinicians to predict PCaSS and to plan follow-up schedules after diagnosis.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747988","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.744301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.712945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.711549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Zoledronic acid","weight":0.541577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoledronic_acid"},{"name":"Antiandrogen","weight":0.358791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiandrogen"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.307745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.283898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.177717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"642","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/642"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Underwriting","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"M1 motorway","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway"},{"name":"M0 motorway (Hungary)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M0_motorway_(Hungary)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
