{"id":91230,"title":"The Drowning Index: implementation in drowning, mechanical asphyxia, and acute myocardial infarct cases.","abstract":"Drowning is a diagnosis of exclusion based on circumstantial and autopsy correlation. Sugimura proposed a threshold value of 14.1 for the Drowning Index (DI), the ratio of lung and pleural fluid to spleen weight, as a surrogate marker to diagnose drowning. We questioned the use of DI in diagnosing drowning. We compared DI between three groups--drowning, mechanical asphyxia, and myocardial infarct--seen at Broward MEO from 2008 to 2009. Only 9.4% of 53 drownings exceeded the DI threshold of 14.1, while 30% of 10 mechanical asphyxias and 40% of 10 myocardial infarcts had DI >14.1. Sensitivity for the DI test was <10% and specificity 60-70%. Median DI values for all groups were <10. Mann-Whitney U-test was not statistically significant between groups. The DI is neither sensitive nor specific and lacks any utility in the diagnosis of drowning.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528098","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.876779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.841687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.814343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Diagnosis of exclusion","weight":0.715553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis_of_exclusion"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.66819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.573145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.46629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.352255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.208774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Drowning","weight":0.120262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.118236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Surrogate endpoint","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_endpoint"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Digital intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_intermediate"},{"name":"Circumstantial evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence"},{"name":"Medium Earth orbit","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_orbit"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Broward County, Florida","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Discovery Investigations","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Investigations"}]}
