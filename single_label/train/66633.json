{"id":66633,"title":"Stereotactic gamma-ray body radiation therapy for asynchronous bilateral renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"To preliminarily evaluate the feasibility, therapeutic effect and toxicity of stereotactic gamma-ray body radiation therapy (?-SBRT) for asynchronous bilateral renal cell carcinoma (bRCC).A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of nine patients with asynchronous bRCC who were unable to undergo surgery and received ?-SBRT between February 2002 and May 2012. A total dose of 36-51 Gy was delivered to the 50 % isodose line covering the planning target volume at 3-5 Gy/fraction, whereas a total dose of 60-85 Gy was delivered at 5-7 Gy/fraction to the gross target volume. The local control rate (LC) and overall survival rate (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Patient follow-up ended in March 2013 and the follow-up rate was 100 %. Of the nine patients, none presented with complete remission and five (55.6 %) achieved partial remission. The objective response rate was 55.6 %. The 1-, 3- and 5-year LC rates were 64.8, 43.2 and 43.2 %, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 66.7, 53.3 and 35.6 %, respectively. Four (44.4 %) patients had an acute radiation reaction; there were two cases of grade I leukocytopenia and two cases of grade I gastrointestinal reactions. Late radiation-induced toxicity consisted of grade II gastrointestinal reactions in two patients.Stereotactic gamma-ray body radiation therapy was found to be safe and effective in the treatment of asynchronous bRCC. Improved prognosis will require individualised treatment and a combination of multiple therapeutic approaches; this will be a primary research trend in the future.","date":"2014-11-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696288","annotations":[{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.653499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.638682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.593124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Stereotactic surgery","weight":0.516498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.49771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.473664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.416408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.333641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.225534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Radiation hardening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening"}]}
