{"id":11963,"title":"Feline gastrointestinal surgery: principles and essential techniques.","abstract":"Gastrointestinal (GI) surgical procedures are performed commonly in cats in general practice for both diagnostic and treatment purposes. It is essential that the surgeon understands and adheres to the principles of GI surgery in order that postoperative morbidity and mortality are kept to a minimum.This review is aimed at feline and general practitioners wanting to update their core skills in GI surgery. It discusses anatomical considerations and surgical principles, and aims to familiarise the surgeon with techniques (some well established, others newer) that will help to promote surgical success.Standard general surgical equipment is required, together with the facilities to provide adequate pre-, intra- and postoperative patient care.The author draws on clinical experience and evidence from the literature, where appropriate, in reviewing the guidance and techniques under discussion.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563494","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.766438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"General surgery","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_surgery"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgical instrument","weight":0.489409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_instrument"},{"name":"List of surgical procedures","weight":0.487055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.474942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.307409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.211952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Author","weight":0.151377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"}]}
