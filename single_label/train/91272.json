{"id":91272,"title":"Evaluation of composition and mineral structure of callus tissue in rat femoral fracture.","abstract":"Callus formation is a critical step for successful fracture healing. Little is known about the molecular composition and mineral structure of the newly formed tissue in the callus. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to assess mineral structure of callus and cortical bone and if it could provide complementary information with the compositional analyses from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy. Femurs of 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats at 9 weeks of age were fractured and fixed with an intramedullary 1.1 mm K-wire. Fractures were treated with the combinations of bone morphogenetic protein-7 and/or zoledronate. Rats were sacrificed after 6 weeks and both femurs were prepared for FTIR and SAXS analysis. Significant differences were found in the molecular composition and mineral structure between the fracture callus, fracture cortex, and control cortex. The degree of mineralization, collagen maturity, and degree of orientation of the mineral plates were lower in the callus tissue than in the cortices. The results indicate the feasibility of SAXS in the investigation of mineral structure of bone fracture callus and provide complementary information with the composition analyzed with FTIR. Moreover, this study contributes to the limited FTIR and SAXS data in the field.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522802","annotations":[{"name":"Bone morphogenetic protein","weight":0.922179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_morphogenetic_protein"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.894315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.603596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.581468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.539073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.509074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.453828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.437717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.400385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.363151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.297105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.268656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Zoledronic acid","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoledronic_acid"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Crystal structure","weight":0.0698746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Scattering","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering"},{"name":"Femoral fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_fracture"},{"name":"Fourier transform","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Malignant transformation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_transformation"},{"name":"Arthropod leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod_leg"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"},{"name":"Complementarity (molecular biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Small-angle X-ray scattering","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_X-ray_scattering"}]}
