{"id":12369,"title":"Cytokine and immunoglobulin isotype profiles during CP7_E2alf vaccination against a challenge with the highly virulent Koslov strain of classical swine fever virus.","abstract":"CP7_E2alf is a promising marker vaccine candidate against classical swine fever (CSF). To better understand the mechanisms of protection, cytokine and isotype-specific antibody profiles were investigated in CP7_E2alf vaccinated pigs before and after challenge with the highly virulent CSFV strain \"Koslov\" at 14 days or 6 months post-vaccination. The interference of vaccination with CSFV pathogeny-related cytokine responses, previously described following a moderately virulent challenge, was confirmed. However, the levels of additional cytokines, TNF-? and IL-6, were significantly attenuated by vaccination following highly virulent challenge. This vaccine interference with cytokine response was not dependent on the immunization route or the consequence of competition between vaccine and challenge strain. Interestingly, IFN-? enhancement and persistent high IgG2 levels suggested an important role of cell-mediated immunity in long-term protection against CSFV induced by CP7_E2alf vaccination. IgA production also revealed a stimulation of mucosal immunity, especially after oral administration of the vaccine.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530018","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.753261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Classical swine fever","weight":0.711498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_swine_fever"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.677207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Isotype (immunology)","weight":0.652324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotype_(immunology)"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.464349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Mucosal immune system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosal_immune_system"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Competition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
