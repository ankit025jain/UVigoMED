{"id":60857,"title":"Therapy of HIV-associated lymphoma-recommendations of the oncology working group of the German Study Group of Physicians in Private Practice Treating HIV-Infected Patients (DAGNÃ„), in cooperation with the German AIDS Society (DAIG).","abstract":"AIDS-related aggressive B cell lymphoma (HIV-NHL) is the second most common HIV-associated malignancy. In contrast, Hodgkin-lymphoma (HL) is one of the most common non-AIDS-defining malignancies. Current evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of HIV-associated lymphoma (HIV-lymphoma) are not available. A panel of experts in the field of HIV-related lymphoma performed literature searches of the PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases. The consensus process was carried out as an e-mail and meeting-based discussion group. Six cycles of R-CHOP or R-EPOCH are standard of care for patients (pts) with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Pts with Burkitt lymphoma and good performance status should receive dose-intensive regimens such as the GMALL B-ALL/NHL protocol. Standard therapy has not been defined for pts with plasmablastic and primary effusion lymphoma. Pts with lymphoma in sensitive relapse should receive high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Stage- and risk adapted treatment yields high remission and survival rates in pts with HIV-HL similar to those achieved in HIV-negative HL pts. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) should be applied concurrently to chemotherapy provided that pharmacokinetic interactions are being considered. Pts with HIV-lymphoma should usually be treated in an identical manner to HIV-negative patients.
