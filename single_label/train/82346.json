{"id":82346,"title":"Comparison of intraoral harvest sites in the edentulous versus dentate specimen.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the edentulous vs dentate specimen intraoral bone harvest sites. We wished to identify if there were any sites that yielded similar quantities of bone regardless of the status of the dentition.There were 59 cadavers in the study. Three continuous outcomes (area, thickness, and volume) were measured for each cadaver at 4 sites (zygoma, symphysis, ramus, and coronoid).Status of the dentition was not a factor in the quantity of harvested bone in regard to surface area and volume. The only difference noted between the dentate and edentulous groups was the thickness in the symphysis and zygomaticomaxillary buttress, with the dentate group, on average, having greater thickness.There appeared to be similar amounts of bone available in dentate and edentulous specimens in our study. This information should encourage clinicians to consider intraoral bone harvest for augmentation of an edentulous ridge regardless of the status of the dentition.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642447","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.378106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Harvest","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"},{"name":"Zygoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygoma"},{"name":"Buttress","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttress"},{"name":"Symphysis menti","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphysis_menti"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Ridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Surface area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
