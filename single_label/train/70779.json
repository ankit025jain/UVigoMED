{"id":70779,"title":"[Influencing factors of pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer patients: results of a single-center 10-year retrospective study].","abstract":"To analyze the influencing factors of pathologic complete response (PCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer patients.A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the clinical data of 620 locally advanced breast cancer patients at Henan Cancer Hospital between April 2003 to February 2013. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 94 patients achieved PCR. The correlation between clinicopathological factors and PCR was analyzed.No significant correlations existed between PCR with patient age, menstrual status or pretherapeutic lymph node status. Increased chemotherapeutic cycles could improve the rate of PCR (14.1% or 19.5 %), but it had no statistical difference. The rate of PCR achieved by regimens of anthracycline plus taxane was higher (20.1%)than that by anthracycline-based regimens (12.7%). And the rate of PCR had significant difference between two regimens. In terms of biological indicators, PCR rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with estrogen/progesterone receptor, but it had no correlation with Ki-67 index or the status of epidermal growth factor receptor. Logistic multifactorial analysis showed that tumor size ? 5 cm were significantly correlated with PCR. Trastuzumab could obviously increase the PCR rate (15.7% or 41.7 %) and there was statistical difference (P = 0.031).The regimens of anthracycline plus taxane can achieve a higher PCR rate. Patient age, menstrual status and pretherapeutic lymph node have no significant correlation with PCR. PCR rate is associated with the expression of ER/PR negative in breast cancer. Trastuzumab increase the PCR rate in the HER-2 positive patients. Tumor size ? 5 cm is a significant influencing factor of PCR rate.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142991","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Anthracycline","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracycline"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.821863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Taxane","weight":0.804998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxane"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.795452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.624116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.570374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.542436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.539713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.408367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.314089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.23622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.164594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.15486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.140264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Henan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
