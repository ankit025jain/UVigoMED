{"id":46611,"title":"DW-MRI of liver lesions: can a single ADC-value represent the entire lesion?","abstract":"To evaluate whether focal liver lesions (FLLs) exhibit a homogeneous appearance on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and whether there is inter-section variation in the calculated ADC values of FLLs (inter-section range).Eighty-eight patients with 128 FLLs (70 benign, 58 malignant) who underwent abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI were included. Two observers evaluated variation of signal intensity of each FLL within each ADC map image (intra-section) and among different ADC map images through the lesion (inter-section). ADC values of each FLL and neighbouring liver parenchyma were measured on all sections. The inter-section range of FLLs was compared with the neighbouring liver parenchyma.Intra-section inhomogeneity was noted in 39.8% (97/244 sections) and 38.9% (95/244) of benign lesions, and 61% (114/187 sections) and 61.5% (115/187) of malignant lesions, by observer 1 and observer 2, respectively. Inter-section inhomogeneity was noted in 25.7% (18/70) and 27.1% (19/70) of benign lesions, and 51.7% (30/58) and 50% (29/58) of malignant lesions, by observer 1 and observer 2, respectively. The inter-section range for both benign (0.28 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and malignant (0.25 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) FLLs were significantly greater than that of liver parenchyma surrounding benign (0.16 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, p < 0.001) and malignant (0.14 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, p = 0.01) FLLs.Due to intra-/inter-section variations in ADC values of benign and malignant FLLs, a single ADC value may not reliably represent the entire lesion.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625693","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.389099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.332662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.331221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.210822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.145444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Mass diffusivity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_diffusivity"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"1870","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1870"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Intersection (road)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(road)"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"FIRST Lego League","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Lego_League"},{"name":"Intersection (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(film)"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
