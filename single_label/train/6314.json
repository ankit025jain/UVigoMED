{"id":6314,"title":"Interferon ?-secreting mesenchymal stem cells combined with minocycline attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.","abstract":"We previously demonstrated that interferon ? (IFN-?)-secreting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-IFN-?) strongly reduced the clinical severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), compared with MSCs alone. Recently, minocycline ameliorates the clinical severity of multiple sclerosis (MS). Herein, we evaluated the effects of a combined treatment of MSCs-IFN-? and minocycline on EAE mice. The combined treatment significantly alleviated the clinical severity mainly by maintaining the integrity of blood-spinal cord barrier, in a manner likely involving inhibition of microvascular disruption, matrix metalloproteinases, neuroinflammation, and enhancement of immunomodulatory effects. Therefore, this combined treatment has the potential to improve the functional recovery of patients with MS.
