{"id":41756,"title":"Effects of 5-amino salicylic acid on the expression of multidrug resistance gene in ulcerative colitis.","abstract":"To study the effect of drugs on the expression of multidrug resistance gene in ulcerative colitis.The expressions of multidrug resistance (MDR) 1 gene and its product P-Gp were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry to realize the impact of drugs on ulcerative colitis.MDR1 gene and P-Gp did not exhibit significant difference (P > 0.05) before and after amino salicylic acid drug treatment. Compared with the control group, their expressions before treatment in the ineffective corticosteroid- and immunosuppressant-treated groups did not exhibit significant difference (P > 0.05). Their pre- and post-treatment expressions in the ineffective groups were compared with those in the normal control group and in the effective group, and significant differences were observed (P < 0.05).5-Amino salicylic acid drugs have little effect on the expression of MDR1 and its product P-Gp. The expressions of MDR1 and P-Gp were much higher in groups that showed ineffectiveness for corticosteroids and immunosuppressants after treatment.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901142","annotations":[{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.896071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Salicylic acid","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.724246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.708045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.682648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.644821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.527219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.417127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.399216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.2671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.265635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.101538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0634039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
