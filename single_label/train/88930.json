{"id":88930,"title":"Three cases of Spontaneous Vertebral Artery Dissection (SVAD), resulting in two cases of Wallenberg syndrome and one case of Foville syndrome in young, healthy men.","abstract":"First patient, presented with sudden onset of headache, left hypoacusia and right hemiparesis, posteriorly developing gaze-evoked nystagmus and worsening right-sided weakness. Diagnosis of vertebral artery dissection and Foville Syndrome were made through clinical assessment and CT-carotid angiogram-MR angiography. Second patient, presented with four episodes of pain over left side of the nose and left eye pain over 1 month; admitted for acute facial pain without limb weakness. During admission, tingling over V1/V2 facial territory, vertigo, hypotension, uvula deviation and right lower limb numbness. CT-carotid angiogram confirmed vertebral artery with dissection. MRI revealed left lateral medullary infarct. Third patient, presented with sudden onset of left facial numbness and right upper limb weakness; 1 day after, right arm and leg hypoesthesia with hoarseness. MRA revealed dissection of left distal vertebral artery and MRI showed infarction in lower medulla oblongata.
