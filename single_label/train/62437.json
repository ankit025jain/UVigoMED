{"id":62437,"title":"Ellagic acid inhibits PKC signaling by improving antioxidant defense system in murine T cell lymphoma.","abstract":"Antioxidants protect the cells from the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Production of ROS during cellular metabolism is balanced by their removal by antioxidants. Any condition leading to increased levels of ROS results in oxidative stress, which participates in multistage carcinogenesis by causing oxidative DNA damage, mutations in the proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Antioxidant defense system is required to overcome the process of carcinogenesis generated by ROS. Antioxidant enzymes are major contributors to endogenous antioxidant defense system. Protein kinase C (PKC) is generally involved in cell proliferation and its over expression leads to abnormal tumor growth. Out of three classes of PKC, classical PKC is mainly involved in cell proliferation and tumor growth. Classical PKC initiates signaling pathway and leads to activation of a number of downstream protein via activation of NF-?B. Therefore any agent which can promotes the endogenous antioxidant defense system should be able to down regulate PKC and NF-?B activation and thus may be useful in reducing cancer progression. To investigate this hypothesis we have tested the effect of antioxidant ellagic acid on antioxidant enzymes and PKC signaling in Dalton's lymphoma bearing (DL) mice. DL mice were treated with three different doses of ellagic acid. The treatment significantly increases the activity and expression of antioxidant enzymes and down regulates the expression of classical isozymes of PKC as well as the activation of NF-?B, indicating that ellagic acid improves antioxidant defense system and PKC signaling via NF-?B which may contribute to its cancer preventive role.
