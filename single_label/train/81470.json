{"id":81470,"title":"A microleakage study of gutta-percha/AH Plus and Resilon/Real self-etch systems after different irrigation protocols.","abstract":"The development and maintenance of the sealing of the root canal system is the key to the success of root canal treatment. The resin-based adhesive material has the potential to reduce the microleakage of the root canal because of its adhesive properties and penetration into dentinal walls. Moreover, the irrigation protocols may have an influence on the adhesiveness of resin-based sealers to root dentin.The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different irrigant protocols on coronal bacterial microleakage of gutta-percha/AH Plus and Resilon/Real Seal Self-etch systems.One hundred ninety pre-molars were used. The teeth were divided into 18 experimental groups according to the irrigation protocols and filling materials used. The protocols used were: distilled water; sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)+eDTA; NaOCl+H3PO4; NaOCl+eDTA+chlorhexidine (CHX); NaOCl+H3PO4+CHX; CHX+eDTA; CHX+ H3PO4; CHX+eDTA+CHX and CHX+H3PO4+CHX. Gutta-percha/AH Plus or Resilon/Real Seal Se were used as root-filling materials. The coronal microleakage was evaluated for 90 days against Enterococcus faecalis. Data were statistically analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival test, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests.No significant difference was verified in the groups using chlorhexidine or sodium hypochlorite during the chemo-mechanical preparation followed by eDTA or phosphoric acid for smear layer removal. The same results were found for filling materials. However, the statistical analyses revealed that a final flush with 2% chlorhexidine reduced significantly the coronal microleakage.A final flush with 2% chlorhexidine after smear layer removal reduces coronal microleakage of teeth filled with gutta-percha/AH Plus or Resilon/Real Seal SE.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25025557","annotations":[{"name":"Phosphoric acid","weight":0.800257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid"},{"name":"Sodium hypochlorite","weight":0.75491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.560459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.449832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.274266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Hypochlorite","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorite"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Distilled water","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_water"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0518106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Seal hunting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Root canal","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Premolar","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"},{"name":"Hunting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Pinniped","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
