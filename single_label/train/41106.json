{"id":41106,"title":"Risk factors for complications after duodenopancreatectomy. Initial results after implementing a standardized perioperative protocol.","abstract":"During 1993-2008 period, in the Surgical Clinic III were conducted several retrospective studies, in order to identify risk factors for complications after cephalic duodenopancreatectomy(DP). As a result of these studies, a preoperative protocol was developed for preparation of patients proposed for DPC, as well as a number of intraoperative technical changes in order to improve postoperative morbidity and mortality. Implementation of the protocol was gradually and inomogenic done in our service.The study is prospective, conducted in 2009-2012, ina group of 180 patients and aims to evaluate immediate results after DPC for periampular malignancy, looking to analyze the effects of implementation of the protocol mentioned above.We analyzed the rates of complications (pancreatic fistula,blunt pancreatitis, bleeding from the pancreatic blunt, delayed gastric emptiness), and the factors that might influence their occurrence.of the 180 patients, 10 (5.5%) developed pancreatic fistula and 24 (13.3%) had delayed gastric emptiness. Among the factors that have been significant associated with these complications we mention: the pancreatico-jejunalanastomosis and gastro-jejunal transmesocolic assembly. With the implementation of the protocol, the risk factors previously identified in retrospective studies performed in our service(elevated transaminases, experienced surgical team, etc.) have lost significance, but they have not disappeared entirely, due to fact that the conduit proposed was not entirely followed. We believe that the homogeneous application of a perioperative guide, together with a standardized surgical technique, will lead to improve immediate results after DP.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956335","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.684931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.676438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.52868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Head","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Pancreatic fistula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_fistula"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Interlingua","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Waterway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway"},{"name":"Federal Security Service (Russia)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service_(Russia)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Technical features new to Windows Vista","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_features_new_to_Windows_Vista"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
