{"id":28616,"title":"From Hofmann to the Haight Ashbury, and into the future: the past and potential of lysergic acid diethlyamide.","abstract":"Since the discovery of its psychedelic properties in 1943, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has been explored by psychiatric/therapeutic researchers, military/intelligence agencies, and a significant portion of the general population. Promising early research was halted by LSD's placement as a Schedule I drug in the early 1970s. The U.S. Army and CIA dropped their research after finding it unreliable for their purposes. NSDUH estimates that more than 22 million (9.1% of the population) have used LSD at least once in their lives. Recently, researchers have been investigating the therapeutic use of LSD and other psychedelics for end-of-life anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cancer, and addiction treatment. Adverse psychedelic reactions can be managed using talkdown techniques developed and in use since the 1960s.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830180","annotations":[{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Lysergic acid diethylamide","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Psychedelic","weight":0.812177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic"},{"name":"Controlled Substances Act","weight":0.798363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act"},{"name":"Central Intelligence Agency","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Psychedelic drug","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug"},{"name":"Psychopharmacology","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopharmacology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Psychedelic therapy","weight":0.585027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy"},{"name":"Lysergic acid","weight":0.546738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid"},{"name":"United States Army","weight":0.540286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Albert Hofmann","weight":0.374091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.368654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"List of Schedule I drugs (US)","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Schedule_I_drugs_(US)"},{"name":"1960s","weight":0.331777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Haight-Ashbury","weight":0.116559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haight-Ashbury"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Discovery (law)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"1970s","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s"},{"name":"1943","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943"},{"name":"1960","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960"},{"name":"1970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
