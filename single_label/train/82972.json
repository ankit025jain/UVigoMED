{"id":82972,"title":"Registry of the Spanish network of Behçet's disease: a descriptive analysis of 496 patients.","abstract":"To describe the clinical features of a large cohort of 496 Spanish patients with Behçet's disease (BD) and to analyse if patient's sex influenced the initial and cumulated prevalence of disease manifestations.Retrospective and descriptive study of 496 patients recruited in sixteen centres on the frame of the Spanish Registry of Behçet Disease Project Group. Demographic and clinical data are presented in addition to treatments and their related adverse effects. Clinical features at disease onset and during follow-up were compared according to the sex of the patients.On the whole series, female to male ratio was 1.2:1.0. Mean age at disease onset was 28.7±12.6 years (range 17-73). Oral ulcers were the most frequent initial manifestation presented in 52.0% of patients. During follow-up, eye inflammatory disease was recorded in 45.1% of patients; thrombosis in 19.7% and central nervous system involvement in 13.5%. Men had higher prevalence of ocular involvement and venous thrombosis (52.5% vs. 39.2%, p=0.004 and 26.3% vs. 9.6%, p<0.001, respectively).Spanish patients with BD presented similar clinical characteristics as their counterpart in the same geographical area and other world regions. In addition, we confirmed that ocular and vascular involvements are more frequent in men than in women.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480539","annotations":[{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.611932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.557256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.488248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.384048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.375225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.315289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.097397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Bangladesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Geographic coordinate system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Trans man","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_man"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Human sex ratio","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sex_ratio"}]}
