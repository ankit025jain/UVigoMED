{"id":86548,"title":"Examining Nek2 as a better proliferation marker in non-small cell lung cancer prognosis.","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to identify a better potential biomarker for the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expressions of Nek2, MCM7, and Ki-67 were evaluated in 270 NSCLC tissues using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence techniques. Associations between protein expression and clinical pathologic characters were assessed, and the impact on overall survival was analyzed. We detected high levels of Nek2, MCM7, and Ki-67 expression in 25.9, 35.2, and 24.4 % of NSCLC tissues, respectively. Overexpressions of Nek2 were detected more frequently in high T-stage and N-stage cases (P = 0.000, 0.011). The expressions of Nek2, MCM7, and Ki-67 were correlated with each other. Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that patients with overexpression of Nek2, MCM7, and Ki-67 had a poorer overall survival rate compared to those with low expression for all stages (P = 0.000). In particular, the patients with Nek2 overexpression had the most negative prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that Nek2, MCM7, and Ki-67 are independent prognostic indicators for NSCLC. Our data suggest that among Nek2 kinase, MCM7, and Ki-67, it is Nek2 kinase that is the more effective tumor proliferation marker of poor prognosis for NSCLC patients. Thus, Nek2 may represent a new potential target for NSCLC therapeutic intervention.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763826","annotations":[{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.922179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.912381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.790162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.601573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.437478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.310085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.288665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.256107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
