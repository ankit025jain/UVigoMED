{"id":47931,"title":"An atypical case of focal nodular hyperplasia. Problems of imagistic diagnosis.","abstract":"Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a hepatic disease first described in 1958. The existence of an accessible and minimally invasive imagistic investigation to establish the diagnosis in a large number of cases would be desirable, especially because once diagnosed, the disease needs no treatment. We present the case of a young woman with long term use of oral contraceptives in which the diagnosis of FNH was established at a routine ultrasound. Evolution of disease during the pregnancy and the atypical imagistic aspect of liver lesions raised many problems of differential diagnosis.
