{"id":68945,"title":"Metformin anti-tumor effect via disruption of the MID1 translational regulator complex and AR downregulation in prostate cancer cells.","abstract":"Metformin is an approved drug prescribed for diabetes. Its role as an anti-cancer agent has drawn significant attention because of its minimal side effects and low cost. However, its mechanism of anti-tumour action has not yet been fully clarified.The effect on cell growth was assessed by cell counting. Western blot was used for analysis of protein levels, Boyden chamber assays for analyses of cell migration and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) followed by western blot, PCR or qPCR for analysis of protein-protein and protein-mRNA interactions.Metformin showed an anti-proliferative effect on a wide range of prostate cancer cells. It disrupted the AR translational MID1 regulator complex leading to release of the associated AR mRNA and subsequently to downregulation of AR protein in AR positive cell lines. Inhibition of AR positive and negative prostate cancer cells by metformin suggests involvement of additional targets. The inhibitory effect of metformin was mimicked by disruption of the MID1-?4/PP2A protein complex by siRNA knockdown of MID1 or ?4 whereas AMPK activation was not required.Findings reported herein uncover a mechanism for the anti-tumor activity of metformin in prostate cancer, which is independent of its anti-diabetic effects. These data provide a rationale for the use of metformin in the treatment of hormone na√Øve and castration-resistant prostate cancer and suggest AR is an important indirect target of metformin.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484909","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.892598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Immunoprecipitation","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.741068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.739852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.723855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.716144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.712902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Translation (biology)","weight":0.653037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.480952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.440935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.212037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"AMP-activated protein kinase","weight":0.195556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
