{"id":61466,"title":"[Nutritional status of Guarani indigenous children in the States of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, Brazil].","abstract":"This article reports the results of a nutritional survey among Guarani indigenous children < 5 years of age in the States of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, Brazil. Prevalence rates for malnutrition according to various anthropometric indices were 50.4% (low stature-for-age), 7.9% (low weight-for-age), and 0.8% (low weight-for-stature). Prevalence of stunting in Guarani children was 96% higher than for indigenous children in Brazil as a whole (25.7%) and 7.2 times that in children from the general population (7%). Prevalence of anemia was 65.2%, 3.1 times higher than in non-indigenous children (20.9%). The study highlights the high prevalence of chronic undernutrition and anemia in Guarani children and calls attention to serious inequalities in health and nutrition that affect indigenous children in Brazil.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714954","annotations":[{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.531305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.496977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Rio de Janeiro","weight":0.438889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.351675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0719954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"List of WWE Intercontinental Champions","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_Intercontinental_Champions"},{"name":"Guarani language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarani_language"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"7 and 7","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_and_7"},{"name":"Stunting (broadcasting)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunting_(broadcasting)"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Introduced species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species"}]}
