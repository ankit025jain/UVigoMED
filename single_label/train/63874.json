{"id":63874,"title":"Effective control of relapsing disseminated intravascular coagulation in a patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis by recombinant soluble thrombomodulin.","abstract":"A 70-year-old Japanese man was hospitalized for expanding purpura and chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) caused by decompensated liver cirrhosis. As there are no effective treatments for chronic DIC caused by liver cirrhosis, we decided to administer recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhsTM) after he provided informed consent. The DIC was rapidly improved; however, the purpura and coagulopathy recurred after two months, and repeated rhsTM treatments were required. The rhsTM treatment sufficiently controlled the coagulopathy for two years, without any complications, including bleeding. This is the first report demonstrating that rhsTM can be administered safely and repeatedly to a patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis, and that it appears to be associated with a favorable outcome.
