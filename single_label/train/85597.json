{"id":85597,"title":"Influenza activity - United States, 2013-14 season and composition of the 2014-15 influenza vaccines.","abstract":"During the 2013-14 influenza season in the United States, influenza activity increased through November and December before peaking in late December. Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) viruses predominated overall, but influenza B viruses and, to a lesser extent, influenza A (H3N2) viruses also were reported in the United States. This influenza season was the first since the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic in which pH1N1 viruses predominated and was characterized overall by lower levels of outpatient illness and mortality than influenza A (H3N2)-predominant seasons, but higher rates of hospitalization among adults aged 50-64 years compared with recent years. This report summarizes influenza activity in the United States for the 2013-14 influenza season (September 29, 2013-May 17, 2014â€ ) and reports recommendations for the components of the 2014-15 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.
