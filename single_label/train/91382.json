{"id":91382,"title":"Hyalonect in the treatment of pseudarthrosis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate union rates and complications of Hyalonect, a knitted mesh composed of HYAFF, a benzyl ester of hyaluronic acid, and a naturally occurring constituent of the extracellular matrix, for the treatment of pseudarthrosis.The study included 11 patients (8 male, 3 female; mean age: 44.6 years; range: 23 to 57 years) operated for pseudarthrosis using Hyalonect. Average time between initial treatment and surgical procedure was 12.9 (range: 8 to 48) months. Pseudarthrosis of the tibia, femur and humerus was present in 4, 2 and 5 patients, respectively. All patients had undergone prior surgery (1 to 6 times). Each patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation. Allograft was applied to the pseudarthrosis area and covered with Hyalonect. Mean follow up period was 31 (range: 12 to 48) months.Union was achieved in all patients after an average of 6 (range: 4 to 8) months. One patient had a discharge for two weeks. Another developed an infection which responded well to appropriate antibiotic treatment. No malunion or implant failure was observed. One patient with pre-existing radial nerve palsy maintained the condition.Use of Hyalonect appears to be a safe method with a positive impact on union in the surgical treatment of pseudarthrosis, particularly in the absence of any infection.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509216","annotations":[{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.900742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.876726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.872067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.771081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.523391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radial nerve","weight":0.422038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_nerve"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.391224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Wrist drop","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist_drop"},{"name":"Pseudarthrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudarthrosis"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Benzyl","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzyl"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Hypertext Transfer Protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"},{"name":"Knitting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knitting"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
