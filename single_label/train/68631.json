{"id":68631,"title":"Kidney transplantation: evaluation and clinical outcome of 237 recipients at low, medium, high, or strong immunological risk of rejection.","abstract":"Donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) play a fundamental role in kidney transplantation. The identification of DSAs is an essential rejection parameter.We evaluated a protocol in 237 patients receiving kidneys from living (LDs) and deceased donors (DDs). Recipients were classified as being at low (LR), medium (MR), high (HR), or strong (SR) risk of rejection based on Luminex panel reactive antibody (PRA)-single antigen beads (SABs). Grafts that survived for 1 year were evaluated.Of the 237 transplanted patients, 129 (54.43%) received a kidney from an LD and 108 (45.57%) from a DD. Of 95 LR recipients receiving kidneys from LDs, 2 patients lost the graft due to non-immunological causes. Of 34 MR recipients, 13 had rejection episodes, and 2 lost the graft by AMR and one by cellular rejection (CR). Of 108 recipients receiving a kidney from a DD, 59 (54.63%) were LR, 31 (28.70%) MR, 11 (10.19%) HR, and 7 (6.48%) SR. Twenty of all transplanted recipients lost their grafts; 4 were due to clinical causes, 4 by cellular rejection, and 12 by antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) with PRA-SAB mean fluorescent intensity of 530 to 12,591. One-year graft survival for LD transplanted LR and MR patients was 97.6% and 94.1%, respectively (P = .004). In DD recipients, the LR vs MR SD was P = .011, and for LR vs HR + SR it was P = .001. For MR vs HR+SR no SD was found (P = .323).Rejections were detected in 51 patients (21.52%). Graft failure occurred in 16 patients (6.75%). A total of 218 (91.98%) recipients maintained good kidney function after 1 year. This protocol based on fluxogram risk assessment of AMR provided fast and precise immunological evaluation of recipients and donors and stratification by immunological risk of AMR.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507033","annotations":[{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.774159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.614291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.586301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.147245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Bead","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Destroyer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"591","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/591"},{"name":"Laserdisc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laserdisc"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Doctor of Divinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Divinity"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Adaptive Multi-Rate audio codec","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Multi-Rate_audio_codec"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"}]}
