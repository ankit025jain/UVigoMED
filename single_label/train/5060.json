{"id":5060,"title":"Risk of vascular injury at the proximal tibia for medial narrow locking plate fixation: an anatomical study using CT angiogram.","abstract":"To evaluate possibility of screw-related vascular injury at proximal tibia while using medial narrow tibial locking plate.Cross-sectional images of CTangiographs (33 samples) at levels corresponding with the screw holes of a narrow locking plate were used to evaluate the risk of vascular injury relating to screw insertion. This was performed by measuring the distance and angle between the screw trajectory in each hole and the columns of arteries at the proximal tibia.There is a higher risk of injury to the anterior tibial artery than to the posterior tibial artery in cases of perfect placement of a medial locking plate for osteosynthesis of the tibial shaft fracture. In instance of plate tilting, thus causing a deviation ofscrew trajectory of up to 20 degrees from the perpendicular axis of the middle 1/3 of medial tibial surface, the posterior tibial artery is also at risk of being injured.Vascular injury relating to locking screw insertion from the medial aspect of the tibia is still a risk. To prevent vascular injury, the plate should be positioned in the middle 1/3 and parallel to the medial tibial surface. Attachment of the instrument beyond the far cortex of the tibia stillpresents a risk of injuring the tibial artery.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25365904","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.864194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.747458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.740368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.674194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.395179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.278477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anterior tibial artery","weight":0.248986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_tibial_artery"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.240178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.201462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"Posterior tibial artery","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_tibial_artery"},{"name":"Axis (anatomy)","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Perpendicular","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular"},{"name":"Body of tibia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_tibia"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Trajectory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory"},{"name":"Perfect (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Tilting train","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilting_train"},{"name":"Electron hole","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole"},{"name":"Attachment theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory"},{"name":"Posterior tibial vein","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_tibial_vein"}]}
