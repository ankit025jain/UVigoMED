{"id":55564,"title":"Radial versus raster spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scan patterns for detection of macular pathology.","abstract":"To compare the 6-line radial vs the 25-line raster spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) acquisition patterns at detecting intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid, vitreomacular traction, and full-thickness macular hole (MH).Retrospective cross-sectional analysis.Series of 365 eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), central and branch retinal vein occlusion (CRVO/BRVO), central serous chorioretinopathy, vitreomacular traction, and full-thickness MH. Sequential 6-line radial and 25-line raster scans were evaluated for intraretinal/subretinal fluid and, when applicable, vitreomacular traction and MH.For neovascular AMD (133 scans), 7 25-line raster scans confirmed subretinal/intraretinal fluid not identified by the 6-line radial (P=.02). For DME (140 scans) and central serous chorioretinopathy (91 scans), 25-line raster confirmed fluid in 4 scans (P=.13) and 1 scan (P=.32), respectively, that was not observed with the 6-line radial. For CRVO (123 scans) and BRVO (126 scans), 25-line raster confirmed fluid on 2 (P=.25) and 4 scans (P=.13), respectively, that was not detected by the 6-line radial. Conversely, for focal vitreomacular traction (70 scans) and full-thickness MH (82 scans), 25-line raster missed focal traction (<1500 ?m) and MH in 5 scans (P=.07) and 7 scans (P=.02), respectively, that were identified using the 6-line radial.The 6-line radial scan is statistically comparable to the 25-line raster at detecting fluid in DME, BRVO/CRVO, and central serous chorioretinopathy, but not neovascular AMD. Furthermore, it is superior to the 25-line raster pattern at detecting early MH formation, while demonstrating a positive trend in identifying focal vitreomacular traction.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857688","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.901023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Diabetic retinopathy","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.741285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.575314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.574777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.537023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.510315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.245833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.228267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Distance measuring equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_measuring_equipment"},{"name":"Central serous retinopathy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_serous_retinopathy"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"1500","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"1500 metres","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres"},{"name":"Central retinal vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Raster graphics","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics"},{"name":"Central retinal vein occlusion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein_occlusion"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"}]}
