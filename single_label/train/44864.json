{"id":44864,"title":"Overexpression of Her-2 upregulates FoxM1 in gastric cancer.","abstract":"The transcription factor, forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1), and the tyrosine kinase receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2), are aberrantly expressed in a number of human malignancies, and are closely associated with the development of cancer. However, their regulatory mechanisms and their involvement in tumor development have not been extensively investigated, particularly in gastric cancer. In the present study, we examined the expression levels of FoxM1 and Her-2 in samples from patients with gastric cancer, as well as gastric cancer cell lines. Their regulatory mechanisms and the connection between them were also explored. We found that FoxM1 and Her-2 expression was markedly higher in the gastric cancer samples, while a strong association was found between them at the mRNA and protein level. When we regulated the levels of Her-2 in the gastric cancer cell lines, the expression of FoxM1 changed accordingly. Following the transfection of Her-2 expression vectors into the gastric cell lines, the luciferase activity of the FoxM1 promoter positively increased along with the concentration of pcDNA3.1-Her-2. However, Her-2-siRNA inverted this variation, which was further confirmed by treatment with the Her-2 inhibitor, trastuzumab, revealing that Her-2 regulates FoxM1 expression at the promoter level in gastric cancer cells. Our results suggest that FoxM1 and Her-2 are important diagnostic markers for gastric cancer. FoxM1 may be a potential cellular target for therapeutic intervention, particularly in gastric cancers resistant to Her-2-targeted therapy.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715000","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.858625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.82565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.78837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Receptor tyrosine kinase","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.75657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.712569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.497682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.395353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.361516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.358761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.298346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"FOX proteins","weight":0.287592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOX_proteins"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"}]}
