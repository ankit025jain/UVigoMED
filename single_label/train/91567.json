{"id":91567,"title":"Acetabular fractures in patients aged > 55 years: a systematic review of the literature.","abstract":"The increasing prevalence of osteoporosis in an ageing population has contributed to older patients becoming the fastest-growing group presenting with acetabular fractures. We performed a systematic review of the literature involving a number of databases to identify studies that included the treatment outcome of acetabular fractures in patients aged > 55 years. An initial search identified 61 studies; after exclusion by two independent reviewers, 15 studies were considered to meet the inclusion criteria. All were case series. The mean Coleman score for methodological quality assessment was 37 (25 to 49). There were 415 fractures in 414 patients. Pooled analysis revealed a mean age of 71.8 years (55 to 96) and a mean follow-up of 47.3 months (1 to 210). In seven studies the results of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) were presented: this was combined with simultaneous hip replacement (THR) in four, and one study had a mixture of these strategies. The results of percutaneous fixation were presented in two studies, and a single study revealed the results of non-operative treatment. With fixation of the fracture, the overall mean rate of conversion to THR was 23.1% (0% to 45.5%). The mean rate of non-fatal complications was 39.8% (0% to 64%), and the mean mortality rate was 19.1% (5% to 50%) at a mean of 64 months (95% confidence interval 59.4 to 68.6; range 12 to 143). Further data dealing with the classification of the fracture, the surgical approach used, operative time, blood loss, functional and radiological outcomes were also analysed. This study highlights that, of the many forms of treatment available for this group of patients, there is a trend to higher complication rates and the need for further surgery compared with the results of the treatment of acetabular fractures in younger patients.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Wounds and
