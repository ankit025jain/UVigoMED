{"id":34491,"title":"Cardiac management of ventilator-assisted individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.","abstract":"As life expectancy of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has increased to the 5th decade, in part due to improved ventilatory support, cardiomyopathy is projected to increase as a cause of death. International guidelines recommend an annual assessment of cardiac function and initiation of appropriate pharmacological treatment. We conducted an audit of the cardiac management in patients with DMD requiring ventilatory support and reported a case series of the collated cardiac investigations. Patients with DMD requiring ventilatory support were included in the study. The date of the last electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), cardiology review and pharmacological management were retrieved from the medical records. If an annual cardiac assessment had not been performed this was requested and the latest ECGs and ECHO reports were collated. A total of 30 patients with DMD (29 males, mean (SD) age of 30 (7) years) met the inclusion criteria. Although there was ECG and ECHO documentation in 24 and 21 individuals, respectively, it was only recent in 10 and 6 individuals. In all, 60% of patients had been assessed by a cardiologist, but only 10% within the last year. Over half of the patients failed to attend their new appointments. From the available results, 18 of the 19 patients had an abnormal ECG, 11 of the 16 patients had left ventricular (LV) impairment and 55% of patients had a change in prescription following cardiac investigations. There is a need for a coordinated cardiorespiratory approach towards adult patients with DMD. Over a third of patients had normal LV function suggesting that cardiomyopathy is not inevitable in this group.
