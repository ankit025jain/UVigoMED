{"id":87790,"title":"The outcome of proximal humeral fractures in the elderly: predictors of mortality and function.","abstract":"This study describes the epidemiology and outcome of 637 proximal humeral fractures in 629 elderly (? 65 years old) patients. Most were either minimally displaced (n = 278, 44%) or two-part fractures (n = 250, 39%) that predominantly occurred in women (n = 525, 82%) after a simple fall (n = 604, 95%), who lived independently in their own home (n = 560, 88%), and one in ten sustained a concomitant fracture (n = 76, 11.9%). The rate of mortality at one year was 10%, with the only independent predictor of survival being whether the patient lived in their own home (p = 0.025). Many factors associated with the patient's social independence significantly influenced the age and gender adjusted Constant score one year after the fracture. More than a quarter of the patients had a poor functional outcome, with those patients not living in their own home (p = 0.04), participating in recreational activities (p = 0.01), able to perform their own shopping (p < 0.001), or able to dress themselves (p = 0.02) being at a significantly increased risk of a poor outcome, which was independent of the severity of the fracture (p = 0.001). A poor functional outcome after a proximal humeral fracture is not independently influenced by age in the elderly, and factors associated with social independence are more predictive of outcome.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986953","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.680356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.538144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.416327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.241325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Recreation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"560","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/560"},{"name":"278","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/278"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Retail","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail"},{"name":"Minuscule 629","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_629"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
