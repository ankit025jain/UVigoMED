{"id":73541,"title":"Evaluation of microRNA-10b prognostic significance in a prospective cohort of breast cancer patients.","abstract":"MicroRNA-10b (miR-10b) has a prominent role in regulating tumor invasion and metastasis by targeting the HOXD10 transcriptional repressor and has been found up-regulated in several tumor types.We evaluated the expression of miR-10b in paired tumor and normal specimens obtained from a prospective cohort of breast cancer patients with at least 36 months follow-up enrolled according to the REMARK guidelines (n?=?150). RNA quality was measured and only samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ?7.0 were analyzed.The relative expression of miR-10b in tumor as compared to its normal counterpart (RER) was determined by RT-qPCR. miR-10b RERs were higher in the subgroup of patients with synchronous metastases (n?=?11, Median 0.25; IQR 0.11-1.02) as compared with patients without metastases (n?=?90, Median 0.09; IQR 0.04-0.29) (p?=?0.028). In the subgroup of patients without synchronous metastases (n?=?90), higher miR-10b RERs were associated with increased risk of disease progression and death in both univariable (HR 1.16, p?=?0.021 and HR 1.20, p?=?0.015 respectively for 0.10 unitary increase of miR-10b RERs levels) and multivariable (HR1.30, p?<?0.001, and HR 1.31, p?=?0.003 respectively for 0.10 unitary increase of miR-10b RERs levels) Cox regression models. The addition of miR-10b RERs to the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) provided an improvement in discrimination power and risk reclassification abilities for the clinical outcomes at 36 months. Survival C-indices significantly increased from 0.849 to 0.889 (p?=?0.009) for OS and from 0.735 to 0.767 (p?=?0.050) for DFS.Our results provide evidences that the addition of miR-10b RERs to the prognostic factors used in clinical routine could improve the prediction abilities for both overall mortality and disease progression in breast cancer patients.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24897960","annotations":[{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.780314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Transcription
