{"id":71722,"title":"[Experimental study on anti-tumor effect of xihuang pill and its immune clearance function].","abstract":"To discuss the anti-tumor effect of Xihuang pill on tumor-bearing rats and its effect on the immune clearance function of tumor-bearing organisms.Walker256 tumor cells were adopted to establish the tumor-bearing rat model. The rats were randomly divided into five groups: the normal control group, the model control group, the lentinan group and Xihuang pill low dose, middle dose and high dose groups, with 10 rats in each group, and continuously treated and given drugs for 14 d after modeling. Blood and tumors were collected from abdominal aorta to calculate the tumor inhibition rate. The content of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and adhesion molecule B7-1 (CD80) in peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The expressions of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in were determined by ELISA.The tumor inhibition rate of the Xihuang pill high dose group was 33. 1 percent. Compared with the model group, the Xihuang pill large dose group showed significantly low IL-2, IFN-gamma, CD3+, CD4+, B7-1 in peripheral blood, with statistical significance in their differences (P < 0.05).Xihuang pill could show its anti-tumor effect by enhancing the immune clearance function and increasing IL-2, IFN-gamma, CD3+ T, CD4+ T, B7-1 in peripheral blood.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25039190","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"CD80","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD80"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.73345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.641134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.639889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.587555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.5807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.549851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.455491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.400385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Lentinan","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentinan"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.208738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.179457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Abdominal aorta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aorta"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pill (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"}]}
