{"id":86257,"title":"Precision medicine in oncology standard of care.","abstract":"To review the histologic subtypes and staging of non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma, as well as the molecular markers used to direct standard therapy.Book chapters and journal articles from medical and nursing literature, as well as published clinical guidelines.Patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma have had a paucity of treatment options, most fraught with toxicity with limited benefit. Increased understanding of tumor genetics and molecular markers has expanded the treatment options for these patients, often providing them with durable responses and improved quality of life.To provide education and support to their patients, nurses caring for these patients need to understand the role that genetics and molecular markers play in directing these therapies.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794083","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.673266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.479995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.413002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.305524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.287322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.199263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Scientific journal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
