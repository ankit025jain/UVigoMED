{"id":66488,"title":"Long-term activity index after renal failure in a cohort of 32 patients with lupus nephritis.","abstract":"To characterise long-term activity levels after renal failure (RF) in lupus patients.A retrospective activity analysis was performed of 32 lupus nephritis (LN) patients in RF over a maximum of 34 years. Activity was recorded every 6 months using the BILAG index and serological involvement (SI) (C3 and anti-dsDNA antibodies). 'Inactive' disease was defined as no BILAG A/B and no SI, 'moderate disease' as at least BILAG 1A/ 2B or 'major' SI (C3<0.73g/L and/or anti-dsDNA>149IU/ml, and 'severe' as both BILAG 1 A/2B and major SI. Patients on dialysis (n=32) were compared to patients who had a renal transplantation (n=14).In the dialysis group, 12.5% were inactive and 87.5% had at least mild-moderate activity (92.8% due to SI; 85.7% due to clinical activity) of which 37.5% demonstrated severe activity. BILAG involvement was mainly haematological (59.4%) and mucocutaneous (25%). In the renal transplantation group, 92.8% were active (100% due to SI, 84.6% due to clinical activity) of which 28.6% displayed severe activity. BILAG involvement was mainly haematological (57.1%) and renal (50%).Although lupus activity is highly prevalent after RF, when a more restrictive cut off is established, activity decreases from 87.5% to 37.5% in the dialysis group and 92.8% to 28.6% in the renal transplantation group. Serological markers and haematological BILAG activity were the predominant indicators for post-RF lupus activity. We were unable to rule out whether activity derived from an intercurrent process or was intrinsic to the renal failure itself.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708901","annotations":[{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.829982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.782628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Lupus nephritis","weight":0.780323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_nephritis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.680965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.614344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.537563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.501801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Lega Nord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Second baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman"},{"name":"Volvo C30","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_C30"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Characterisation (conflict)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterisation_(conflict)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Complement component 3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_component_3"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_2"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
