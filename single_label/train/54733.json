{"id":54733,"title":"Calcidius, witness to Greek medical theories: eye anatomy and pathology.","abstract":"Calcidius is the only exegete of Plato's Timaeus whose commentary on this Greek dialogue concerned with eyesight has not been lost. This document is all the more valuable since the Latin version is the only testimony regarding theories of and treatments for eye diseases--two domains in which, as can be deduced from the terms used, the commentator is dependent on Greek. The part of the commentary about eyesight is also worthy of interest because it is the only one that openly attacks the iuniores with an overtly hostile tone. We propose to study Calcidius' exegesis of Plato's Timaeus, focusing on Calcidius' portrayal of Greek ophthalmological theories and practices and his representation of a group of people he openly attacks.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195325","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.541595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Greek language","weight":0.538961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.490611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ancient Greek medicine","weight":0.475919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_medicine"},{"name":"Exegesis","weight":0.442177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis"},{"name":"Timaeus (dialogue)","weight":0.361396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue)"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Dialogue","weight":0.194143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Testimony","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimony"},{"name":"Witness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness"},{"name":"Calcidius","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcidius"},{"name":"Tone (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Sports commentator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator"},{"name":"V (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_(comics)"},{"name":"Coming out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Representation (arts)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(arts)"}]}
