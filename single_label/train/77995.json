{"id":77995,"title":"Patulous eustachian tube after percutaneous balloon microcompression for trigeminal neuralgia: case report.","abstract":"To report a case of patulous eustachian tube which occurred after percutaneous balloon microcompression of the Gasserian ganglion.Retrospective case review.A 41-year-old man was referred to our audiovestibular medicine department following episodes of autophony. These symptoms appeared two weeks after percutaneous balloon microcompression performed to treat severe trigeminal neuralgia secondary to multiple sclerosis. A diagnosis of patulous eustachian tube was indicated by clinical examination and tympanometry. The symptoms were present for less than six months and improved without any specific treatment.Percutaneous balloon microcompression is a procedure used for refractory trigeminal neuralgia that can cause transient sensory and motor deficits of any of the trigeminal nerve branches. It is proposed that injury to the mandibular division in this case caused temporary tensor veli palatini dysfunction with consequent patulous eustachian tube.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819466","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Trigeminal neuralgia","weight":0.883816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_neuralgia"},{"name":"Trigeminal nerve","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_nerve"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Trigeminal ganglion","weight":0.716628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_ganglion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.451494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.413426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.303673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.294746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.289179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.270331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.238279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Neuralgia","weight":0.221708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Mandibular nerve","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_nerve"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Tympanometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanometry"},{"name":"Tensor veli palatini muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_veli_palatini_muscle"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Veli","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veli"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Consequent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"A41 autoroute","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A41_autoroute"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"},{"name":"Tensor","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor"}]}
