{"id":90240,"title":"Marking wire placement for improved accuracy in thoracic spinal surgery.","abstract":"To present an innovative approach that does not rely on intraoperative X-ray imaging for identifying thoracic target levels and critically appraise its value in reducing the risk of wrong-level surgery and radiation exposure.96 patients admitted for surgery of the thoracic spine were prospectively enrolled, undergoing a total of 99 marking wire placements. Preoperatively a flexible marking wire derived from breast cancer surgery was inserted with computed tomography (CT) guidance at the site of interest--the wire was then used as an intraoperative guidance tool.Wire placement was considered successful in 96 cases (97%). Most common pathologies were tumors (62.5%) and degenerative disorders (16.7%). Effective doses from CT imaging were significantly higher for wire placements in the upper third of the thoracic spine compared to the lower two thirds (p = 0.015). Radiation exposure to operating room personnel could be reduced by more than 90% in all non-instrumented cases. No adverse reactions were observed, one patient (1.04%) underwent surgical revision due to an epifascial empyema. No wires had to be removed due to lack of patient compliance or infection.This is a safe and practical approach to identify the level of interest in thoracic spinal surgery employing a marking wire. Its application merits consideration in any spinal case where X-ray localization could prove unsafe, particularly in cases lacking bony pathologies such as intradural tumors.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635936","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Empyema","weight":0.722288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empyema"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.661919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","weight":0.6387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.44354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.443034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.373306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.277717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Spinal tumor","weight":0.225489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_tumor"},{"name":"Radioactive contamination","weight":0.212002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_contamination"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.110686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"}]}
