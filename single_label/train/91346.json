{"id":91346,"title":"[Evaluation of the clinical results of non-surgical treatment for pediatric sagittal fracture of mandibular condyle].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical results of occlusal splint in the treatment of sagittal fracture of mandibular condyle (SFMC) in children.Thirty-nine patients (48 condyles)aged 3-8 years with sagittal fracture of mandibular condyle were included in this study. All the patients were treated by occlusal splint.Slight open occlusion was maintained by occlusal splint for 3-6 months. Clinical and radiological examination was performed six mouths and every year after treatment.Good mandibular function was observed in 39 patients. Maximal mouth opening over 35 mm was achieved at 6 months. But 11 of the 39 patients presented with deviation on mouth opening at 6 months. The radiology showed an complete remodeling in 32 condyles (28 patients) and partial remodeling in 16 condyles (11 patients). Poor remodelling was not observed in any patients.Good clinical results can be obtained by using occlusal splint in the treatment of pediatric sagittal fracture of mandibular condyle.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513066","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.646513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.523591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.467821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.282083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.254756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"35 mm film","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film"},{"name":"Condyloid process","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyloid_process"},{"name":"Occlusal splint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusal_splint"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Maximal (Transformers)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_(Transformers)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"}]}
