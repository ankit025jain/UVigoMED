{"id":85656,"title":"Transoral robotic sleep surgery: the obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome.","abstract":"Nocturnal upper airway collapse is often multi-level in nature but typically will involve some degree of obstruction at the level of the tongue-base. Several surgical procedures have been developed in recent years to address this area in patients resistant to continuous positive airway pressure. This article outlines a novel way to treat obstructive sleep apnea lingual obstruction using the da Vinci robotic surgical system. This technique offers significant potential advantages over other established approaches and it should be included in the surgical armamentarium of sleep surgeons.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24882797","annotations":[{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.882502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Positive airway pressure","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.57086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.551017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.52201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.457962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.37361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.23837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Robotic surgery","weight":0.199542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_surgery"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Leonardo da Vinci","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci"},{"name":"Da Vinci Surgical System","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"}]}
