{"id":69699,"title":"Reprogramming the tumor stroma: a new paradigm.","abstract":"A recent article in Cell shows that vitamin D receptor activation reprograms reactive stroma in the tumor microenvironment to a less inflammatory, quiescent state and is associated with increased drug retention, tumor response, and survival in pancreatic cancer models. Stroma reprogramming, as opposed to ablation, may emerge as a new treatment paradigm.
