{"id":74517,"title":"Bayesian model selection for pathological data.","abstract":"The detection of abnormal intensities in brain images caused by the presence of pathologies is currently under great scrutiny. Selecting appropriate models for pathological data is of critical importance for an unbiased and biologically plausible model fit, which in itself enables a better understanding of the underlying data and biological processes. Besides, it impacts on one's ability to extract pathologically meaningful imaging biomarkers. With this aim in mind, this work proposes a fully unsupervised hierarchical model selection framework for neuroimaging data which permits the stratification of different types of abnormal image atterns without prior knowledge about the subject's pathological status.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333134","annotations":[{"name":"Biology","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.768884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Bayesian inference","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Model selection","weight":0.537999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.511326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.357513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.352256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hierarchy","weight":0.347041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.250837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Unsupervised learning","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning"},{"name":"Graphical model","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Hierarchical database model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model"},{"name":"Brightness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Traditional animation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_animation"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Biological plausibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_plausibility"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Conceptual framework","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
