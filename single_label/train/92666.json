{"id":92666,"title":"Robotic follicular unit extraction in hair transplantation.","abstract":"In recent years, there has been a shift toward minimally invasive procedures. In hair transplantation surgery, this trend has manifested with the emergence of follicular unit extraction (FUE). Recently, a robot has been introduced for FUE procedures.To determine the transection rate of a robotic FUE device.The authors discuss the procedure, technical requirements, optimal candidates, advantages, and disadvantages of robotic FUE compared with the standard ellipse.Optimal candidates for robotic FUE are those with dark hair color who can sit for 45 to 120 minutes and are willing to shave a large area for donor harvesting. The main advantages of robotic FUE compared with the standard ellipse are its minimally invasive nature and the lack of a linear scar. The average transection rate with the robot to date is 6.6% (range, 0.4%-32.1%).The robot is a new and innovative method for FUE hair transplantation of which hair transplant surgeons should be aware.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25418806","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.355937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.250737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Ellipse","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Hair transplantation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_transplantation"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Shaving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving"},{"name":"Human hair color","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hair_color"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Overtime (sports)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)"},{"name":"Harvest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Black hair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hair"},{"name":"Follicular unit transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_unit_transplantation"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
