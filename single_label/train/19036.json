{"id":19036,"title":"Functional interest of an articulating spacer in two-stage infected total knee arthroplasty revision.","abstract":"Deep periprosthetic infection is one of the most serious complications after total knee replacement. The two-stage procedure with implantation of a temporary cement spacer and later re-implantation of a revision total knee prosthesis is an accepted procedural standard. The use of articulating spacers has been proposed to enhance ease of revision and functional results.Twenty-three patients treated with an articulating spacer were retrospectively studied. All patients had undergone a two-stage surgery. The infected prosthesis was explanted and the femoral component was sterilized and re-implanted. On the tibial side a block of gentamicin-loaded bone cement was produced intraoperatively using specially manufactured templates. Eighteen total knee arthroplasty revisions and 5 arthrodesis were finally performed.A total of three (13%) re-infections occurred 5-20 months after revision total knee arthroplasty in a mean follow-up period of 47 months. Prior to re-implantation, flexion with the articulating spacer ranged between 15 and 100° (mean 68±28°). The average postoperative flexion after re-implantation of total knee replacement was 105±11°.The articulating spacer used in this study appears to be as effective as the standard procedures in terms of re-infection risk rate and postoperative range of motion recovery.Level IV.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746494","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.66794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.437284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.416275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.347157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.315323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arthrodesis","weight":0.251011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrodesis"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Bone cement","weight":0.132628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_cement"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sterilization (microbiology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0178944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Procedural programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"},{"name":"Standard operating procedure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"}]}
