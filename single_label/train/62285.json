{"id":62285,"title":"[Expression of miR-16 in patients with T lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia].","abstract":"This study was purposed to investigate the expression of miR-16 in T lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-LBL/ALL) and its relation with target therapy and prognosis. The CD3, cCD3, CD10, CD20, CD34, CD43, CD99, TdT, PAX-5, BCL-2 and Ki67 in paraffin samples from 38 cases of T-LBL/ALL were detected by immunohistochemical labeling; the miR-16 expression level was detected by real-time RT-PCR. Fifteen cases of reactive hyperplasia of lymph nodes were selected as control. The results indicated that among 38 cases of T-LBL/ALL the positive rate of TdT was highest (94.7%), the positive rate of CD34 was lowest (22.1%), the PAX-5 and CD20 were found to be negative. The Ki67 expression level in 39.5% cases exceeded 80%. As compared with reactive hyperplasia of lymph node, the miR-16 expression in T-LBL/ALL was up-regulated, ant its expression level was 4.87-fold of reactive hyperplasia of lymph node (P < 0.05). The overall survival rate in group of miR-16 high expression decreased (P < 0.05). The prognosis of T-LBL/ALL patients with BCL-2 positive expression was better than that of patients with BCL-2 negative expression (P < 0.05). The miR-16 expression correlated with BCL-2 protein (r = 0.51, P < 0.05). It is concluded that the overall survival rate in miR-16 high expression group is higher than that in miR-16 low expression group, suggesting possible relation of miR-16 with prognosis. Moreover, the prognosis in BCL-2 positive expression group is better than that in negative expression group, which may be a factor influencing prognosis.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598659","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"CD20","weight":0.674475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD20"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.535257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Neprilysin","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neprilysin"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.420678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.370048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.305041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"CD43","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD43"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase","weight":0.0924838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_deoxynucleotidyl_transferase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Ant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Bachelor of Civil Law","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Civil_Law"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Ion Television","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"}]}
