{"id":16594,"title":"[Bacterial meningitis caused by beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae in a 1-year-old girl: a case report].","abstract":"We present herein the case report of bacterial meningitis caused by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) in a 1-year-7-month-old girl with no medically significant history. NTHi from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was the beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin resistant strain (BLNAR). Some beta-lactams were administrated, but fever was prolonged. Finally, rifampicin seemed to be effective. In NTHi, compared with H. influenzae type b (Hib), the prevalence of BLNAR is high. Hence, complicated cases may increase in the near future if the use of the Hib vaccine becomes widespread, and meningitis caused by NTHi increases. It may be necessary to consider combination therapy or use of non-beta-lactams that have a different antimicrobial mechanism from beta-lactams. PCR analysis revealed the possibility that the CSF isolate lacked the P5 protein gene. Though deficiency of P5 fimbriae is known to reduce the affinity of NTHi for the human respiratory epithelium, determining whether P5 deficient NTHi induced meningitis will require further study.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974453","annotations":[{"name":"Haemophilus influenzae","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae"},{"name":"Rifampicin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.876079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.825048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Ampicillin","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampicillin"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Hib vaccine","weight":0.663076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hib_vaccine"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.637384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacterial meningitis","weight":0.575955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_meningitis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.537563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.454221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fimbria (bacteriology)","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fimbria_(bacteriology)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Respiratory epithelium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_epithelium"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Haemophilus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus"},{"name":"Spider bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_bite"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
