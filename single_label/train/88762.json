{"id":88762,"title":"[Arthroscopic treatment of Snyder II type of superior labrum anterior and posterior injury by absorbable anchors through anterior and posterior approach].","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of arthroscopic treatment of superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) injury by absorbable anchors through anterior and posterior approach.Between January 2010 and August 2012, 28 patients with Snyder II type of SLAP injury underwent arthroscopic operation by absorbable anchors through anterior and posterior approach. There were 15 males and 13 females, aged from 30 to 45 years (mean, 36.5 years). The left shoulder was involved in 12 cases and the right shoulder in 16 cases. All patients had a clear history of trauma. The disease duration ranged from 2 weeks to 3 years (median, 13 months). The results of O'Brien test and Speed test were positive in 25 cases and 26 cases respectively. Shoulder pain visual analogue scale (VAS) was 7.6 +/- 1.4. The Constant score of shoulder joint function was 60.2 +/- 4.3.Operation was successfully completed, and the incision healed well in all cases, with no complication. The follow-up time ranged from 12 to 36 months (mean, 24.5 months). The symptoms of shoulder joint interlocking, snapping, and instability disappeared. The joint pain was significantly improved. At 12 months after surgery, Constant score of shoulder joint function was 92.7 +/- 4.5, showing significant difference when compared with preoperative score (t = -30.279, P = 0.000); the shoulder pain VAS score was 1.1 + 0.9, showing significant difference when compared with preoperative score (t = 23.810, P = 0.000). At 1 year after operation, MRI examination showed complete healing in 25 cases, and high signal in 3 cases, but the pain and activity were significantly improved.Arthroscopic treatment of SLAP injury by absorbable anchors through anterior and posterior approach has the advantages of less injury, small incision, and quick recovery, so it is an ideal operation method.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and
