{"id":50521,"title":"Advice to follow a low-carbohydrate diet has a favourable impact on low-grade inflammation in type 2 diabetes compared with advice to follow a low-fat diet.","abstract":"Inflammation may play an important role in type 2 diabetes. It has been proposed that dietary strategies can modulate inflammatory activity.We investigated the effects of diet on inflammation in type 2 diabetes by comparing a traditional low-fat diet (LFD) with a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD). Patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to follow either LFD aiming for 55-60 energy per cent (E%) from carbohydrates (n = 30) or LCD aiming for 20 E% from carbohydrates (n = 29). Plasma was collected at baseline and after 6 months. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2 were determined.Both LFD and LCD led to similar reductions in body weight, while beneficial effects on glycaemic control were observed in the LCD group only. After 6 months, the levels of IL-1Ra and IL-6 were significantly lower in the LCD group than in the LFD group, 978 (664-1385) versus 1216 (974-1822) pg/mL and 2.15 (1.65-4.27) versus 3.39 (2.25-4.79) pg/mL, both P < 0.05.To conclude, advice to follow LCD or LFD had similar effects on weight reduction while effects on inflammation differed. Only LCD was found significantly to improve the subclinical inflammatory state in type 2 diabetes.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779961","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.755037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.666133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.637278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.40147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.290671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Diet food","weight":0.111378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_food"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor","weight":0.110833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Liquid crystal display","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal_display"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"254","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/254"},{"name":"654","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/654"},{"name":"1216","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1216"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Ra","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra"}]}
