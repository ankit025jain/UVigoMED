{"id":87129,"title":"Effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in individuals who for economic reasons were switched from a once-daily single-tablet regimen to a triple-tablet regimen.","abstract":"To assess the impact on virological outcomes of a switch from branded single-tablet regimen (STR) including tenofovir, efavirenz, and emtricitabine (STR-TEE) to generic triple-tablet regimen (TTR), including tenofovir, efavirenz, and lamivudine (TTR-TEL), which was implemented on April 1, 2011 to obtain economic savings.From the Capital Region of Denmark (covering two-thirds of the Danish HIV patients), we included combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-naive patients who administered STR-TEE from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011 (n = 111) or TTR-TEL from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012 (n = 56) and cART-experienced HIV patients who were on STR-TEE from April 1, 2010 (n = 356) or were switched from STR-TEE to TTR-TEL after April 1, 2011 (n = 512). We estimated the fraction with detectable HIV-RNA, development of the 184V/I resistance mutations, and time to switch of cART. Approximately 96.2% of cART-experienced patients on STR-TEE were shifted to TTR-TEL after April 1, 2011. For the naive STR-TEE and TTR-TEL patients, the fractions with detectable HIV-RNA at week 48 were 7.0% and 8.3% and for the cART experienced 4.0% and 4.4%, respectively. The 184V/I resistance mutation was detected in 1 cART-experienced patient on TTR-TEL with virological failure. The risk of switch to a new cART regimen was slightly increased in the cART-experienced population (difference in 1-year risk: 1.5%; 95% confidence interval: -2.4% to 5.4%).In settings comparable with the Danish health care system, the estimated economic savings from a switch from STR-TEE to TTR-TEL can be realized with negligible short-term risk of adverse outcomes.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984188","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.493687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.130308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.103079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.0599722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Capital Region of Denmark","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Region_of_Denmark"},{"name":"Emtricitabine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emtricitabine"},{"name":"Efavirenz","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efavirenz"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Tenofovir","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenofovir"},{"name":"Generic drug","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug"},{"name":"April 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_1"},{"name":"Brussels","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels"},{"name":"March 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_31"},{"name":"Switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"356","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/356"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Capital city","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_city"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Transthyretin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transthyretin"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Negligible","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible"}]}
