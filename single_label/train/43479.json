{"id":43479,"title":"Conformity and robustness of gated rescanned carbon ion pencil beam scanning of liver tumors at NIRS.","abstract":"Pencil beam scanning offers excellent conformity, but is sensitive to organ motion. We conducted a simulation study to validate our rescanning approach in combination with gating in the irradiation of liver tumors.4DCT imaging was performed under free-breathing conditions in 30 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Dose distributions for a two-field approach were calculated for layered phase controlled rescannings (PCR) under organ motion conditions. A total dose of 45 Gy(RBE) was delivered to respective field-specific target volumes (FTVs) in two fractions, each composed of two orthogonal uniform fields of 11.25 Gy(RBE) at beam angles of either 0° and 90° or 0° and 270°. The number of rescannings was changed from 1 to 10.Good dose conformity was achieved with 4× PCR or more, and over 95% of the prescribed dose was delivered to the CTV independent of the use of gating. D95, Dmax/min and dose homogeneity were similar with or without gating, whereas V10 dose to the liver as well as maximal doses to healthy tissue (esophagus and cord) were about 40% lower with gating. However, total time increased by about 50% with gating.Gated rescanning provides good target coverage and homogeneity with maximal sparing of healthy tissue. Our results suggest that carbon-ion pencil beam scanning may soon be available for the safe treatment of liver tumors.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785510","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.734955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.543349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.518766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.508308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.409035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.122425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Liver cancer","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"CTV Television Network","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_Television_Network"},{"name":"Pencil (optics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil_(optics)"},{"name":"V10 engine","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V10_engine"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Pencil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"270","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/270"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Gated community","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_community"},{"name":".45 ACP","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.45_ACP"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Gating","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gating"},{"name":"Discrete cosine transform","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform"},{"name":"Molecular geometry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_geometry"},{"name":"Radiation hardening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening"},{"name":"Conformity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"}]}
