{"id":71398,"title":"Three advantages of using traditional Chinese medicine to prevent and treat tumor.","abstract":"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), an important component of complementary and alternative medicine, has evolved over thousands of years with its own unique system of theories, diagnostics and therapies. TCM has been increasingly used in the last decades and become well known for its significant role in preventing and treating cancer.
