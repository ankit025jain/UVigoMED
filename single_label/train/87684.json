{"id":87684,"title":"[Case-control study on therapeutic effects of ozone and triamcinolone acetonide on the treatment of meniscal injury].","abstract":"To compare the clinical therapeutic effects between ozone and triamcinolone acetonide for the treatment of mild meniscal injury.From January 2008 to December 2012, 119 patients with meniscal injury diagnosed as type I or II by MRI were divided into three groups. In the triamcinolone acetonide (A) group, there were 38 males and 2 females, with an average age of (25.34 +/- 6.34) years old, ranging from 18 to 48 years old; 36 patients had single knee injuries, 4 patients had double knee injuries and 44 knees with joint effusion. In the ozone (B) group,there were 37 males and 2 females, with an average age of (26.98 +/- 7.20) years old, ranging from 19 to 50 years old; 33 patients had single knee injuries, 6 patiens had double knees injuries and 40 knees with joint effusion. In the combination of ozone and triamcinolone acetonide (C) group, there were 37 males and 3 females,with an average age of (26.44 +/- 6.38) years old, ranging from 18 to 47 years old; 33 patients had single knee injuries, 7 patients had double knees injuries and 39 knees with joint effusion. The patients were treated with injection of 3 mg triamcinolone acetonide alone, 30 ml (30 microg/ml) ozone alone, or both two drugs respectively in knee joint cavity. All the treatment methods were carried out weekly and 4 times injections were required for a treatment course. Knee joint function was evaluated by Lysholm scale and knee joint effusion was examined by MRI before and after treatment.The scale of knee joint function was 35.68 +/- 4.15 and 65.55 +/- 7.66 in group A, 36.35 +/- 6.83 and 74.39 +/- 8.47 in group B, 36.62 +/- 6.03 and 95.47 +/- 4.78 in group C before and after treatment. Compared with that before treatment, the total scale of knee joint function improved after treatment in every group. The total scale of group C was better than that of the other groups after the treatment,but there was no significant difference between group A and group B. The effective rate of these drugson joint effusion was 68.18% in group A, 62.5% in group B and 87.18% in group C. The effect of co-injection on joint effusion in group C was significantly better than that of triamcinolone acetonide or ozone alone, but the difference between group A and group B was not significant.Ozone and triamcinolone acetonide are effective in the treatment of mild meniscal injury, which can relieve symptoms and promote the recovery of joint function. Campared with the single injection, the combination of ozone and triamcinolone acetonide is better.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029836","annotations":[{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.631519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.5788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.536658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Ozone","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.439062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Triamcinolone","weight":0.233635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Acetone","weight":0.1401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Triamcinolone acetonide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone_acetonide"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Meniscus (anatomy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Articular capsule of the knee joint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular_capsule_of_the_knee_joint"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
