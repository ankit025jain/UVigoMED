{"id":19076,"title":"Effects of antibiotics administration on the incidence of wound infection in percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy.","abstract":"The effect of antibiotics during the perioperative period of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is still controversial. A total of 297 patients who underwent the PDT procedure were divided into 2 groups:those administered antibiotics perioperatively and those not administered antibiotics. Wound infections were noted in 7 cases (incidence rate, 2.36%) and no death was recorded. Of the 69 patients without antibiotics, 5 developed wound infections (incidence rate, 7.25%), while only 2 of the 228 patients with antibiotics developed wound infections (incidence rate, 0.88%) (p?0.002;risk ratio, 8.82;95% confidence interval, 1.67-46.6). Of the 7 cases of wound infection, 5 cases occurred during the early period after PDT (within 7 days). Collectively, the present results suggest that prophylactic administration of antibiotics may prevent the incidence of PDT-induced wound infection, especially in the early phase after the PDT procedures. The need for antibiotics in PDT should be reconsidered.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743781","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.502377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.436156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.38724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.339734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
