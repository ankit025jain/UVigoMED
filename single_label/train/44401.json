{"id":44401,"title":"PLCE1 rs2274223 polymorphism contributes to risk of esophageal cancer: evidence based on a meta-analysis.","abstract":"We sought to reassess the association of PLCE1 rs2274223 and susceptibility to esophageal cancer (EC) through a meta-analysis of published case-control studies. Using the PubMed and Embase, we identified nine articles including fourteen case-control studies (15,225 cases and 23,620 controls). ORs and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of GG vs. AA, GG + GA vs. AA, GG vs. GA + AA, G vs. A, and AG vs. AA genetic models were estimated for each study. All of the genetic models indicated a statistically significant positive association with EC risk. The association appeared most pronounced for carriers of GG genotype (GG vs. AA: OR, 1.35; 95 % CI, 1.17 to 1.57), and weakest for individuals carrying GA genotype (GA vs. AA: OR, 1.13; 95 % CI, 1.05 to 1.23). Stratification analyses showed similar results in the population of Asians and in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This meta-analysis provides strong statistical evidence for an elevated risk of EC associated with PLCE1 rs2274223. The association remains significant in Asian population and ESCC. Further investigations are warranted to validate these findings.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24737582","annotations":[{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.710086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.695645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.662376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.516117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.498583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.367177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.234165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Personal Load Carrying Equipment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Load_Carrying_Equipment"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"PLCE1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLCE1"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Alcoholics Anonymous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous"},{"name":"Aircraft carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier"},{"name":"European Commission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Stratified sampling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"225","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Aktiengesellschaft","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiengesellschaft"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
