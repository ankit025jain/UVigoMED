{"id":71613,"title":"[Enhanced sensitivity of leukemia cell line KG-1a to activated immune cell-mediated cytolysis after treated with resveratrol].","abstract":"To explore the enhanced sensitivity of leukemia cell line KG-1a to activated immune cell-mediated cytolysis after treated with resveratrol.The value of 50% inhibition concentration (IC??) for KG-1a by resveratrol was analyzed using trypan blue staining. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated, and then activated by interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15. The sensitivity of KG-1a treated with and without resveratrol to activated immune cell-mediated cytolysis was assayed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) -releasing assay. The expression of tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) on the surface of activated immune cells and its receptors (DR4/5 and DcR1/2) on the surface of KG-1a were detected by flow cytometry.Resveratrol could inhibit the proliferation of KG-1a and IC50 at 24 h was 25 mmol/L. At a ratio of 10:1 or 20:1 between effect and target, the cytolytic rates of treated KG-1a by activated immune cells were (55.80 ± 10.88)% and (72.31 ± 13.06)%, significantly higher than (24.96 ± 9.25)% and (37.93 ± 5.21)% of untreated KG-1a (P<0.05). The expression of DR5 on the surface of KG-1a treated with resveratrol was (9.05 ± 3.57)%, significantly higher than (3.11 ± 0.54)% of untreated KG-1a (P<0.05). Conversely, the expression of DcR1 on the surface of treated KG-1a was (13.23 ± 3.56)%, lower than (53.75 ± 10.51)% of KG-1a (P<0.05). When TRAIL pathway on the surface of activated immune cells was blocked, the cytolytic rates of treated KG-1a were (35.97 ± 6.36)% and (49.80 ± 10.68)%, significantly lower than (52.92 ± 6.98)% and (70.73 ± 9.79)% of untreated KG-1a (P<0.05) at the same ratio of effector and target.Resveratrol could enhance cytolytic sensitivity of KG-1a by activated immune cells through TRAIL pathway.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052611","annotations":[{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.858629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.853598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.841687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.762962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Cytolysis","weight":0.735458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytolysis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.697078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.603533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.5654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.544634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.534377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.42381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Resveratrol","weight":0.391956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.259322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Trypan blue","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypan_blue"},{"name":"Interleukin 15","weight":0.127237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_15"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"HLA-DR","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DR"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Trail","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"}]}
