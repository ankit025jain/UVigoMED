{"id":17431,"title":"Acid suppressive agents and risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: case-control study.","abstract":"The acid-suppressive agents have been linked with an increased risk of infectious disease. The relationship between these drugs and Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB) was not been reported.We conducted a case-control study using data from National Health Insurance research database of Taiwan. From 1996 till 2008, and 6541 cases were defined as TB infection/activation (ICD-9 coding plus prescription two of four first-line anti-TB regimen for at least one month). Control subjects who were matched to the TB cases by age and sex were selected with 10:1 ratio. Medical records including acid-suppressive agent prescription and comorbidity, and socioeconomic status were analyzed.TB infection/activation was more frequent to comorbidity with chronic diseases, alcohol abuse, malignancy, immune deficient/suppression status and acid-related disease (peptic ulcer, reflux esophagitis). Among the TB cases, there was higher exposure record to acid-suppressive agents within 3 months before TB index date (OR 2.43(2.06-2.88) and 1.90 (1.68-2.14) for proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and histamine 2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) respectively). After adjusting confounding factors, PPIs prescription 3 months before TB index date had an association of TB infection/activation (adjusted OR 1.63(1.61-1.63)). Similar result was found in H2RA user (adjusted OR 1.51(1.50-1.52)). The association of acid-suppressive agents in TB infection/activation was fade gradually when the drug prescription period extended.Recent prescription of acid-suppressive agent seems to associate the TB infection/activation. In the society where TB was prevalent, evaluation of pulmonary TB before prescription of PPI or H2RA is warranted.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
