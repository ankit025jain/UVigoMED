{"id":38661,"title":"Decreased vitamin D levels in children with familial Mediterranean fever.","abstract":"To determine the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in children with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and to investigate the factors associated with low vitamin D status.Forty-four patients with FMF and 39 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Demographic data, FMF symptoms, disease duration, time to delay for diagnosis, duration of follow-up, disease severity score, MEFV gene mutation, cumulative colchicine dose, compliance to treatment and serum C-reactive protein levels were recorded for each patient. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured by an original commercial kit based on chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA).The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly lower in FMF patients than the healthy controls (12.9 ± 3.6 and 16.3 ± 5.5 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.001). Vitamin D levels were similar in patients homozygous for M694V and other genotypes (11.8 ± 3.7 and 13.2 ± 3.6 ng/mL, respectively, P = 0.21). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that the cumulative colchicine dose was the strongest independent variable correlating with vitamin D levels (r(2) = 0.194, P = 0.001).Our results suggest that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are decreased in children with FMF. Cumulative colchicine dose appears to negatively affect vitamin D levels. The role of colchicine on vitamin D metabolism needs to be elicited.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410734","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.775324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.726842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.614497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mediterranean Sea","weight":0.487592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.33659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.336567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.25896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Familial Mediterranean fever","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_Mediterranean_fever"},{"name":"Colchicine","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"MEFV","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEFV"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Chemiluminescence","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
