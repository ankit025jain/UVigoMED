{"id":29458,"title":"[The relationship between BDNF gene polymorphisms and alcoholics in Japan].","abstract":"As a help of the mechanism elucidation of alcoholism, we studied the relationship between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265, 270 C/T (ID number has not yet been determined), and rs10835210 gene polymorphisms, which are reported to be related to bipolar disorder, and alcoholics. We genotyped the three polymorphisms in the BDNF gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in 65 alcoholics and 71 healthy controls. In this study, there was no significant difference in the frequency of rs6265 and 270 C/T polymorphisms between alcoholics and controls (P > 0.05). However, there was a significant difference in the genotype frequency of rs10835210 polymorphism between alcoholics and controls (P < 0.05), in which the CA heterozygote genotype and A allele frequency was higher in alcoholics than in the controls. It suggests the possibility that the BDNF rs10835210 gene polymorphism affects the etiology of alcoholism.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660556","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Heterozygote","weight":0.792383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.75392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.716148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.667347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.662401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.656734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.599967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.59936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.319198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.243394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor"},{"name":"Genotype frequency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype_frequency"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Idaho","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho"},{"name":"270","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/270"},{"name":"National identification number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Neurotrophin","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotrophin"}]}
