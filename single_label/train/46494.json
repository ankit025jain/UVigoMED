{"id":46494,"title":"[Peritoneal malignant mesothelioma: review and recent data].","abstract":"Peritoneal malignant mesothelioma is a rare tumor, less common than its pleural counterpart. It develops from the mesothelial cells overlying peritoneum and preferentially occurs in male, with an average age ranging from 47 to 60.5 years. Asbestos whose impact is less strong than in pleural mesothelioma, SV 40 virus, chronic peritonitis could be implicated as factors favoring the development of peritoneal mesothelioma. Clinical symptoms are not specific, and the imagery remains little or not contributive. The 2004 WHO classification recognizes 3 different types, which differ in terms of presentation and prognosis: diffuse epithelioid mesothelioma (the most common), sarcomatoid mesothelioma and biphasic mesothelioma. Many variants are described within these groups. Immunohistochemistry is mandatory to affirm or disprove peritoneal malignant mesothelioma diagnosis, based on a panel of antibodies divided in positive markers and negative markers. Indeed an accurate diagnosis is necessary to define a therapeutic strategy more and more frequently based on the combination of radical surgery and hyperthermic intra peritoneal chemotherapy. Such an approach significantly improves the prognosis of these aggressive diseases.
