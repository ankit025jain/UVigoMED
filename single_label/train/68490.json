{"id":68490,"title":"Heparin use during dialysis sessions induces an increase in the antiangiogenic factor soluble Flt1.","abstract":"Soluble Flt1 (sFlt1) is a potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor, secreted mainly by the placenta, endothelial cells and monocytes. Increased sFlt1 serum levels correlate with endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular complications in dialysis patients. However, the impact of dialysis by itself on sFlt1 serum levels remains unknown.We assessed sFlt1 kinetics during dialysis and the impact of different dialysis techniques [high-flux haemodialysis (HD), haemodiafiltration (HDF)] and heparinization procedures on sFlt1 serum levels in 48 patients on regular dialysis.sFlt1 serum levels increased as early as 1 min after the start of dialysis and peaked at 15 min before returning to baseline at 4 h [mean peak level 2551 pg/mL, versus 102 before dialysis (P < 0.0001)]. sFlt1 kinetics were similar with two different dialysis membranes. In contrast, when unfractionated heparin (UH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were omitted during dialysis (HD or pre-dilution HDF), no significant increase in sFlt1 levels occurred. Conversely, delayed administration of LMWH (after 30 min of a heparin-free HD) induced a sharp increase in sFlt1. Similarly, when UH and LMWH were omitted and citrate-based dialysate or a heparin-coated membrane was used, sFlt1 levels remained unchanged. When heparinization procedures were the same, no difference in sFlt1 levels was noted between HD and HDF. In vitro, UH and LMWH failed to induce sFlt1 release by monocytes from controls or HD patients. These findings suggest that priming of monocytes on the extracorporeal circuit is required for heparin-induced sFlt1 release or that endothelial cells contribute to this increase.Our results indicate that heparin-based HD induces a major sFlt1 release, which may exacerbate the anti-angiogenic state and thus endothelial dysfunction, commonly found in dialysis patients.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516233","annotations":[{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Placenta","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.614821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.560555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.33407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.153608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.131926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Endothelial dysfunction","weight":0.0575759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelial_dysfunction"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Extracorporeal","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"}]}
