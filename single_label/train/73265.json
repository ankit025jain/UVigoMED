{"id":73265,"title":"A model of immunohistochemical differences between invasive breast cancers and DCIS lesions tested on a consecutive case series of 1248 patients.","abstract":"A previous theoretic model (Tumour Biol 2013;34:1-7.) that breast tumor types differ in the relative rate of tissue invasion was elaborated and developed on a consecutive case series.Histologic data of 68 ductal breast cancer in situ (DCIS) and 1180 invasive ductal cancer (IDC) patients were collected and analyzed.ER+PgR- phenotype was more common in Luminal B2 than among the pooled Luminal A&B1 (p?=?0.0002), and more frequent in Luminal B1 than in Luminal A (p?=?0.0167). The same phenotype was associated with the age older than 54Â years in Luminal B1 and in B2 patients. HER2 type cancers were more frequent in older patients (p?=?0.0038).Tumor progression from DCIS to IDC was found 39% faster than the average in Luminal B1 tumors, supporting the clinical importance of this tumor type. A rare combination of low Ki-67 in HER2 type cancers (only 14% of HER2 type cancers) showed very slow transition to IDC (occurring at only 53.55% of average progression rate), while triple-negative cancers progressed faster than the average, despite Ki-67 value (104.63% for low and 114.27% for high Ki-67 tumors).In three tumor types with positive steroid receptors the ER+PgR- phenotype showed slower IDC transition than the ER+PgR+ phenotype of the same tumor type (difference in progression rate was 38% for Luminal A, 46% for Luminal B1 and 67% for Luminal B2 with Ki67?>?14%).Triple-negative tumors in younger patients exceeded the expected average progression rate by 24%, while in HER2 type tumors, the rate of tissue invasion was in younger patients 20% lower than the expected value.The relative rate of tissue invasion differed substantialy among our patients. Differences depended on tumor types, steroid expression phenotypes and age. The dysfunctional ERs in the ER+PgR- phenotype showed slower rates of tissue invasion, suggesting that ligand binding to functional breast tumor ERs, beside promoting the PgR expression, possibly also promotes tumor transition to the invasive phase.In triple-negative tumors, an age dependent premenopausal mechanism possibly acted as an accelerator of tissue invasion, while faster tissue invasion by HER2-overexpressed tumors in older patients possibly depended on an unidentified mechanism that takes more time to be acquired, so it was less present in premenopausal patients.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917206","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.762222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.68133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Steroid hormone receptor","weight":0.607706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_hormone_receptor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.537436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.404608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Phenobarbital","weight":0.221708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenobarbital"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Ductal carcinoma in situ","weight":0.168769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductal_carcinoma_in_situ"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0720864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Linear particle accelerator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
