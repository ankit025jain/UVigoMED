{"id":38746,"title":"High incidence of abdominal venovenous collaterals after Kawashima operation.","abstract":"Systemic venous collaterals have been found at different stages of single-ventricle palliation, specifically after Kawashima operation. In this study, we present the incidence, clinical features, associated risk factors, and management of such venovenous collaterals (VVCs) after Kawashima procedure.A retrospective review of all the patients who underwent Kawashima procedure prior to December 2011 at Hamad General Hospital, Qatar, was performed. Data were collected and reviewed from medical records.The study group involved a total of six patients with Kawashima procedure. The median age of patients was 112.7 months (range 46-336 months), and median age at the time of Kawashima operation was 31.7 months (range 15-187 months). Mean systemic arterial oxygen saturation (Spo 2) after Kawashima operation was 94.5% ± 1.5%. In five patients, during a median follow-up of 53.4 months (range 16.9-147.9 months), the Spo 2 declined to a mean of 78.8% ± 8.2%. A total of 16 venous collaterals were observed in the study group, and majority (70%) of these collaterals were subdiaphragmatic.In our study, abdominal VVCs were observed in 100% of the patients who were followed after Kawashima operation. We therefore recommend that thorough evaluation for such VVCs should be part of the ongoing evaluation of patients after Kawashima operation, especially in those with low Spo 2. We also recommend early surgical rerouting of hepatic veins to pulmonary arteries in all post-Kawashima patients.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403356","annotations":[{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.795292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.787992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hepatic vein","weight":0.557876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_vein"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.0815175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Collateral circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_circulation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
