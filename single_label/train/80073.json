{"id":80073,"title":"[Clinical analysis of 137 patients with visceral leishmaniasis].","abstract":"To analyze the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of visceral leishmaniasis cases in Sichuan.The medical records of 137 patients with visceral leishmaniasis were reviewed between January 2000 and April 2012 in West China Hospital. The epidemiological data, clinical manifestations, laboratory features, diagnosis, therapeutic procedures and outcome of the patients were retrospectively analyzed.Eighty-eight (64.2%) out of 137 cases were the residents in the endemic area of Sichuan Province and adjacent areas, and 49 (35.8%) were non-endemic area residents with a history of visiting endemic area. Patients living in rural areas accounted for 84.7% (116/137), in town for 15.3% (21/137). Visceral leishmaniasis should be strongly suspected in a patient with prolonged fever, marked hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenectasis, cytopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. All patients showed positive in rk39 dipstick test, and were treated with antimony sodium gluconate. Among these patients, 86.1% (118/137) were cured by drug, 2.9% (4/137) received splenectomy, and 6.6% (9/137) relapsed. The misdiagnosis rate was 23.4% (32/137).Bone marrow smear staining and biopsy, combined with rk39 antibody detection and epidemiological history are crucial for early diagnosis and treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Antimonials is still an effective therapeutic choice.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809196","annotations":[{"name":"Antimony","weight":0.833244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.773873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Hepatosplenomegaly","weight":0.668312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatosplenomegaly"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.56613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.473713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.426206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.419691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Visceral leishmaniasis","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visceral_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Sichuan","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.30687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.304822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.224923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Cytopenia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopenia"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Gluconic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconic_acid"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"}]}
