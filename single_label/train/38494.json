{"id":38494,"title":"Early magnetic resonance detection of cortical necrosis and acute network injury associated with neonatal and infantile cerebral infarction.","abstract":"Knowledge of MRI findings in pediatric cerebral infarction is limited.To determine whether cortical necrosis and network injury appear in the acute phase in post-stroke children and to identify anatomical location of acute network injury and the ages at which these phenomena are seen.Images from 12 children (age range: 0-9 years; neonates [<1 month], n=5; infants [1 month-12 months], n=3; others [?1 year], n=4) with acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) cortical infarction were retrospectively analyzed. Cortical necrosis was defined as hyperintense cortical lesions on T1-weighted imaging that lacked evidence of hemorrhage. Acute network injury was defined as hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging that were not in the MCA territory and had fiber connections with the affected cerebral cortex. MRI was performed within the first week after disease onset.Cortical necrosis was only found in three neonates. Acute network injury was seen in the corticospinal tract (CST), thalamus and corpus callosum. Acute network injury along the CST was found in five neonates and one 7-month-old infant. Acute network injury was evident in the thalamus of four neonates and two infants (ages 4 and 7 months) and in the corpus callosum of five neonates and two infants (ages 4 and 7 months). The entire thalamus was involved in three children when infarction of MCA was complete.In acute MCA cortical infarction, MRI findings indicating cortical necrosis or acute network injury was frequently found in neonates and early infants. Response to injury in a developing brain may be faster than that in a mature one.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24419493","annotations":[{"name":"Middle cerebral artery","weight":0.894098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery"},{"name":"Thalamus","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus"},{"name":"Corticospinal tract","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticospinal_tract"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.848098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Corpus callosum","weight":0.846966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.731065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.634161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Cerebral infarction","weight":0.417303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_infarction"},{"name":"Neural development","weight":0.389893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_development"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Cortex","weight":0.0373501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortex"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Cerebral arteries","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteries"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Territory (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
