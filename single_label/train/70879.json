{"id":70879,"title":"[Clinical analysis of 202 cases of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma].","abstract":"This study was purposed to explore the therapeutic strategy and factors influencing prognosis through the analysis of clinical characteristics, genetic aberrations, treatment and prognosis of the patients with extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). A total of 202 patients with ENKL from 2005-2013 were analyzed retrospectively in term of Ann Arbor stage, B symptoms, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), international prognostic index (IPI), ?2-microglobulin and the expression of MYC,HXO11,BCL-2. The survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method, and the COX regression model was employed for multivariate analysis. The results showed that the 5 year overall survival (OS) rate and event-free survival (EFS) rate were 61.9% and 53.9% respectively; chemoradiotherapy was apparently better than chemotherapy alone for OS and EFS; OS and EFS of the patients with BCL-2 expression were apparently better than patients without BCL-2 expression; multivariant analysis by COX regression showed that Ann Arbor stage and BCL-2 expression were independent prognostic factors for EFS/OS. It is concluded that chemoradiotherapy is better than chemotherapy alone for treatment of ENKL. Ann Arbor stage and BCL-2 expression are independent prognostic factors.
