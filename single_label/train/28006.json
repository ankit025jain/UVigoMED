{"id":28006,"title":"The prevalence, intensity, and assessment of craving for MDMA/ecstasy in recreational users.","abstract":"This study evaluated the prevalence, intensity, and correlates of craving for MDMA/ecstasy among recreational users employing a new multi-item, self-report questionnaire reflecting experiences of desire, intention to use, and anticipated loss of control. Using a web-based data collection procedure, we recruited MDMA/ecstasy users (n = 240) to rate their agreement with eight craving statements immediately before and immediately following 90 seconds of exposure to either ecstasy-related or control stimuli. Participants then completed questionnaires to measure ecstasy refusal self-efficacy, passionate engagement in ecstasy use, substance use history, and demographic information. Fifty percent of participants indicated some level of agreement with at least two (out of eight) statements indicative of craving and 30% agreed at some level with six or more such statements. The questionnaire used to assess craving was internally consistent, unidimensional, and had excellent one-week test-retest reliability. Craving scores varied as a function of both cue exposure and frequency of ecstasy use, and were significantly associated with ecstasy-related attitudes. Recreational users of MDMA/ecstasy endorse some experiences indicative of craving for this drug, even though only a minority report intense craving following explicit cue exposure.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052792","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.530353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.50878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.507581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.335029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.327927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.271864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.206619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.181115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"MDMA","weight":0.178008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.145098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.0506369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Educational assessment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_assessment"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"240","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Web application","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application"},{"name":"Aircraft upset","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_upset"},{"name":"Pornography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography"},{"name":"Tanha","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanha"},{"name":"Engagement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement"},{"name":"Cue stick","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_stick"}]}
