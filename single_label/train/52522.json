{"id":52522,"title":"Usefulness of dual-energy computed tomography imaging in the differential diagnosis of sellar meningiomas and pituitary adenomas: preliminary report.","abstract":"To quantitatively assess the imaging characteristics of sellar lesion in dual-energy computed tomography (CT) imaging for differentiation of sellar meningiomas and pituitary adenomas during the arterial phase (AP) and venous phase (VP).51 patients with sellar/parasellar tumors (33 macroadenomas and 18 meningiomas) were examined with CT spectral imaging during the AP and the VP. Iodine concentrations were derived from iodine-based material-decomposition CT images and normalized to the iodine concentration in the aorta. The difference in Normalized iodine concentrations (NICs), HU curve slope (?HU), and mean CT values of lesions between the AP and VP were calculated. The two-sample t test was performed to compare quantitative parameters between sellar meningiomas and pituitary adenomas.NICs, ?HU, and mean CT values in patients with sellar meningiomas differed significantly from those in patients with pituitary adenomas: Mean NICs were 43.52 mg/mL±1.35 versus 9.23 mg/mL ±2.44, respectively, during the AP and 52.13 mg/mL ±1.04 versus 24.37 mg/mL ±2.23 respectively, during the VP. ?HU were -3.03±3.42 versus -0.53±0.23, respectively, during the AP and -2.96±0.41 versus -0.47±0.25, respectively, during the VP. Mean CT values were 193.63±2.08 versus 63.98±2.85, respectively, during the AP and 203.98±0.18 versus 77.66±0.91, respectively, during the VP. The combination of NIC and Mean CT value during VP had highest sensitivity (90.9%) and specificity (100%) among all phases.Quantitative dual-energy CT imaging has promising potential for diagnostic differentiation of sellar meningiomas and pituitary adenomas.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System
