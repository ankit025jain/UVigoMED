{"id":79405,"title":"Should we screen for misophonia in patients with eating disorders? A report of three cases.","abstract":"In this case report, the authors describe three cases of misophonia in people with eating disorders. Misophonia is a condition where a specific trigger sound provokes an intense emotional reaction in an individual. Case 1 is a 29-year-old with childhood eating issues, anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa whose trigger was a high-pitched female voice. Case 2 is a 15-year-old diagnosed with anorexia nervosa after misophonia onset. Her trigger was people chewing and eating noisily. Case 3 is a 24-year-old woman who presented with anorexia nervosa prior to misophonia onset. Her trigger was the clinking and chewing of her mother and aunt eating cereal. All three cases identified an eating-related trigger sound with a violent aversive reaction and coping mechanisms involving eating avoidance or having a full mouth. Misophonia may be associated with presentations of eating disorders. This case report adds to the literature about the presentation of misophonia.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24431300","annotations":[{"name":"Bulimia nervosa","weight":0.890526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa"},{"name":"Eating disorder","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder"},{"name":"Anorexia nervosa","weight":0.804818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.645987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.528224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.462065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cereal","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.150999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Aversives","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aversives"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Trigger (firearms)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Aunt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aunt"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
