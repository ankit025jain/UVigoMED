{"id":66574,"title":"Serum vanin-1 levels in renal transplant patients.","abstract":"Vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 is a plasma membrane enzyme, also known as pantetheinase. It has been shown that vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 urinary and serum concentrations of vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 increase in nephrotoxicant-induced renal injury before classic markers. Tacrolimus and cyclosporine used as immunosuppressive agents are nephrotoxic drugs. This study sought to investigate alterations of vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 levels after a kidney transplant.This study included 28 renal allograft recipients without acute rejection. Before transplant, and the first and sixth months after the transplant, vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 and creatinine levels were measured in renal transplant recipients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and spectrophotometric methods.During the first month after transplant, we observed a significant increase in vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 levels compared with previous levels (P < .0001). Also, during the sixth month, vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 levels were higher than values previously taken (P < .01), although they were lower compared with the first month values (P = .004). No correlation was found between vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 and creatinine before transplant or during the first and sixth months after transplant. When the patients were divided into subgroups according to the immunosuppressive drugs used, in tacrolimus-treated patients, serum vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 levels were no different from the cyclosporine-administered levels measured at 3 different times.We conclude that serum vascular noninflammatory molecule 1 levels may be low in the end-stage renal failure and transiently increase after transplant owing to transient renal function deterioration, which does not lead to elevation of serum creatinine levels in renal transplant patients.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702142","annotations":[{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.835601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.685203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.624575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.592888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.236595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"}]}
