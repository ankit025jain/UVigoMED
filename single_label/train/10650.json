{"id":10650,"title":"Reproducable paraplegia by thoracic aortic occlusion in a murine model of spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion.","abstract":"Lower extremity paralysis continues to complicate aortic interventions. The lack of understanding of the underlying pathology has hindered advancements to decrease the occurrence this injury. The current model demonstrates reproducible lower extremity paralysis following thoracic aortic occlusion.Adult male C57BL6 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Through a cervicosternal incision the aorta was exposed. The descending thoracic aorta and left subclavian arteries were identified without entrance into pleural space. Skeletonization of these arteries was followed by immediate closure (Sham) or occlusion for 4 min (moderate ischemia) or 8 min (prolonged ischemia). The sternotomy and skin were closed and the mouse was transferred to warming bed for recovery. Following recovery, functional analysis was obtained at 12 hr intervals until 48 hr.Mice that underwent sham surgery showed no observable hind limb deficit. Mice subjected to moderate ischemia for 4 min had minimal functional deficit at 12 hr followed by progression to complete paralysis at 48 hr. Mice subjected to prolonged ischemia had an immediate paralysis with no observable hind-limb movement at any point in the postoperative period. There was no observed intraoperative or post operative mortality.Reproducible lower extremity paralysis whether immediate or delayed can be achieved in a murine model. Additionally, by using a median sternotomy and careful dissection, high survival rates, and reproducibility can be achieved.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637534","annotations":[{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.798171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.733921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Subclavian artery","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_artery"},{"name":"Thoracic aorta","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_aorta"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Median sternotomy","weight":0.550684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_sternotomy"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.550277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Paraplegia","weight":0.515136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.509439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Descending aorta","weight":0.494818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_aorta"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.247557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.224639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Isoflurane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflurane"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
