{"id":61382,"title":"[Follicular lymphoma].","abstract":"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most popular indolent lymphoma. In discussing the appropriate first-line therapy, FL patients are divided into 3 clinical categories: 1) localized-stage FL in which local irradiation is recommended and 30-50% of patients experience long progression-free survival, 2) low-tumor burden advanced-stage FL in which watchful waiting strategy is generally recommended, 3) high-tumor burden advanced-stage FL in which CHOP plus rituximab(R) is recommended and bendamustine plus R is a potent therapeutic option. In relapsed/refractory FL, re-biopsy is needed to evaluate the possible histological transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Relapsed/refractory FL patients should be registered in clinical study because the optimal treatment in such patients is unconfirmed.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724409","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.837674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.630477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bendamustine","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendamustine"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.0961346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.0294679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"31st century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31st_century_BC"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"}]}
