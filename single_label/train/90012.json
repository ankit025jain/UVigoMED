{"id":90012,"title":"Holes in the heart: an atlas of intracardiac injuries following penetrating trauma.","abstract":"The extraordinarily high rate of penetrating heart injuries in South Africa provides a substantial denominator from which we derive a subset of patients with intracardiac lesions as a result of these injuries. The surgical literature, which consists largely of case reports and case series, describing various patterns of injury is dated and a review of management in the era of modern imaging and surgical techniques is warranted.A retrospective observational chart review of all patients with intracardiac injuries following penetrating trauma who were referred to the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban, South Africa, during the 10-year period between July 2003 and July 2013 was performed. The spectrum of pathology encountered included ventricular septal defects, valve apparatus lacerations, intracardiac fistulae, ventricular aneurysms and retained intracardiac missiles.Of the 17 patients, 10 required operative repair of the intracardiac lesions using cardiopulmonary bypass, with no early mortality noted. Seven patients were treated non-operatively, for reasons that varied from insignificant haemodynamic shunts to advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The in-hospital mortality in this group consisted of 1 patient, who was moribund at presentation.The referral of patients for the repair of intracardiac injuries following penetrating cardiac trauma is often delayed. Symptoms of cardiac failure should be optimized medically prior to undertaking definitive surgical repair, thereby also allowing for detailed preoperative imaging to guide appropriate intervention. Utilizing standard principles of intracardiac shunt repair, as well as contemporary valve repair techniques, favourable surgical outcomes may be reproduced. Percutaneous catheter device techniques may prove useful in patients deemed unsuitable for surgical repair, such as patients with sternal wound sepsis.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and
