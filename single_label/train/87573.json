{"id":87573,"title":"Development of a de novo arteriovenous malformation after severe traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are typically considered congenital lesions, although there is growing evidence for de novo formation of these lesions as well. The authors present the case of an AVM in the same cerebral cortex that had been affected by a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) more than 6 years earlier. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report attributing the formation of an AVM directly to TBI.
