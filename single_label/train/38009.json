{"id":38009,"title":"Single-incision video-assisted thoracic resection for extrapulmonary sequestration: a case report.","abstract":"We describe surgical resection of an extralobar pulmonary sequestration via single-incision thoracoscopic surgery (SITS), which we recommend as a suitable surgical option. A 45-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital for further examination of chest abnormal shadow. A rigid 5-mm 30Â° video-thoracoscope, an endograsper and an electric cautery were passed within the same single small incision. The tumor was suspended using articulating endograspers and resected after clipping and ligation of the anomalous vessel. The final pathology was determined an extrapulmonary sequestration.
