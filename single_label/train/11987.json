{"id":11987,"title":"Food pellets as an effective delivery method for a DNA vaccine against infectious pancreatic necrosis virus in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum).","abstract":"A DNA vaccine based on the VP2 gene of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) was incorporated into feed to evaluate the effectiveness of this oral delivery method in rainbow trout. Lyophilized alginate-plasmid complexes were added to feed dissolved in water and the mixture was then lyophilized again. We compared rainbow trout that were fed for 3 consecutive days with vaccine pellets with fish that received the empty plasmid or a commercial pellet. VP2 gene expression could be detected in tissues of different organs in the rainbow trout that received the pcDNA-VP2 coated feed (kidney, spleen, gut and gill) throughout the 15 day time-course of the experiments. This pcDNA-VP2 vaccine clearly induced an innate and specific immune-response, significantly up-regulating IFN-1, IFN-?, Mx-1, IL8, IL12, IgM and IgT expression. Strong protection, with relative survival rates of 78%-85.9% were recorded in the vaccinated trout, which produced detectable levels of anti-IPNV neutralizing antibodies during 90 days at least. Indeed, IPNV replication was significantly down-regulated in the vaccinated fish 45 days pi.
