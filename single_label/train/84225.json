{"id":84225,"title":"Demographic, anthropometric and socioeconomic characteristics of functional constipation in Eastern Croatia.","abstract":"Aim of the research is to establish the prevalence of constipation in Osjecko-baranjska County, to establish its specific characteristics and to determine the effect of demographic, anthropometric and socioeconomic factors. It is a cross-sectional study conducted in 2010. on systematic sample of 900 subjects between 20 and 69 years of age. Every subject was sent an invitation letter and a Rome III diagnostic questionnaire for one of the disorders. A scoring algorithm was used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of functional constipation. The chi-square test (chi2 test), t-test and logistic regression were used for analysis. The prevalence of constipation in our study was 22.19%, which is higher than the prevalence in most other countries, where it ranges from 5% to 18%. In our study statistically significant variables were: place of current residence (urban), education level (high school), marital status (divorced people), a larger number of household members and a lower health status by self-assessment. According to t-test persons with constipation on average are older, have higher average BMI and lower average grade valued financial status of households and their health. There were a greater number of subjects that had at least one alarm symptom or some of the psychosocial factors and they often suffered from a chronic disease. Functional constipation presents a significant health problem. Rome III survey questionnaire proved to be an acceptable method for diagnosing this functional disorder in clinical-consilliary and primary health care, and for persons showing signs of alarm and needing further diagnostic treatment.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
