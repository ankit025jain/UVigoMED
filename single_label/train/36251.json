{"id":36251,"title":"Maternal race, demography, and health care disparities impact risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm neonates.","abstract":"To determine whether risk factors associated with grade 2-4 intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) differs between infants of African ancestry and white infants.Inborn, appropriate for gestational age infants with birth weight 500-1250 g and exposure to at least 1 dose of antenatal steroids were enrolled in 24 neonatal intensive care units. Cases had grade 2-4 IVH and controls matched for site, race, and birth weight range had 2 normal ultrasounds read centrally. Multivariate logistic regression modeling identified factors associated with IVH across African ancestry and white race.Subjects included 579 African ancestry or white race infants with grade 2-4 IVH and 532 controls. Mothers of African ancestry children were less educated, and white case mothers were more likely to have more than 1 prenatal visit and multiple gestation (P ? .01 for all). Increasing gestational age (P = .01), preeclampsia (P < .001), complete antenatal steroid exposure (P = .02), cesarean delivery (P < .001), and white race (P = .01) were associated with decreased risk for IVH. Chorioamnionitis (P = .01), 5-minute Apgar score <3 (P < .004), surfactant use (P < .001), and high-frequency ventilation (P < .001) were associated with increased risk for IVH. Among African ancestry infants, having more than 1 prenatal visit was associated with decreased risk (P = .02). Among white infants, multiple gestation was associated with increased risk (P < .001), and higher maternal education was associated with decreased risk (P < .05).The risk for IVH differs between infants of African ancestry and white infants, possibly attributable to both race and health care disparities.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589078","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Chorioamnionitis","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorioamnionitis"},{"name":"Surfactant","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant"},{"name":"Intraventricular hemorrhage","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraventricular_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Multiple birth","weight":0.858467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Apgar score","weight":0.793132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.645763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.583279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.575998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.321695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.215191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"}]}
