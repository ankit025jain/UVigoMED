{"id":74527,"title":"Global investigation and meta-analysis of the C9orf72 (G4C2)n repeat in Parkinson disease.","abstract":"The objective of this study is to clarify the role of (G4C2)n expansions in the etiology of Parkinson disease (PD) in the worldwide multicenter Genetic Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease (GEO-PD) cohort.C9orf72 (G4C2)n repeats were assessed in a GEO-PD cohort of 7,494 patients diagnosed with PD and 5,886 neurologically healthy control individuals ascertained in Europe, Asia, North America, and Australia.A pathogenic (G4C2)n>60 expansion was detected in only 4 patients with PD (4/7,232; 0.055%), all with a positive family history of neurodegenerative dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or atypical parkinsonism, while no carriers were detected with typical sporadic or familial PD. Meta-analysis revealed a small increase in risk of PD with an increasing number of (G4C2)n repeats; however, we could not detect a robust association between the C9orf72 (G4C2)n repeat and PD, and the population attributable risk was low.Together, these findings indicate that expansions in C9orf72 do not have a major role in the pathogenesis of PD. Testing for C9orf72 repeat expansions should only be considered in patients with PD who have overt symptoms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or apparent family history of neurodegenerative dementia or motor neuron disease.","date":"2014-11-18","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25326098","annotations":[{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.906582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.756384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Motor neurone disease","weight":0.73179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neurone_disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.714642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.712708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.611745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.534631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.461316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.416493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.406674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.282308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.0534202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Orf (disease)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orf_(disease)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Family history (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Genetic epidemiology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_epidemiology"}]}
