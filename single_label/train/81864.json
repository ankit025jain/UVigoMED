{"id":81864,"title":"Teriparatide therapy for denosumab-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw in a male osteoporotic patient.","abstract":"We report the first case of teriparatide adjuvant role in the management of a denosumab-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw in a male subject with idiopathic osteoporosis. Clinical benefits and CT healing were obtained within 2 months of teriparatide initiation and denosumab withdrawal. Increase in bone turnover previously described, when denosumab treatment is removed, might have a synergistic effect to the stimulating effect of teriparatide on bone remodeling to promptly heal osteonecrosis of the jaw.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804929","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Teriparatide","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriparatide"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.268384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Osteonecrosis of the jaw","weight":0.160012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteonecrosis_of_the_jaw"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.113889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Denosumab","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denosumab"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"}]}
