{"id":19649,"title":"Comparison of same day diagnostic tools including Gene Xpert and unstimulated IFN-? for the evaluation of pleural tuberculosis: a prospective cohort study.","abstract":"The accuracy of currently available same-day diagnostic tools (smear microscopy and conventional nucleic acid amplification tests) for pleural tuberculosis (TB) is sub-optimal. Newer technologies may offer improved detection.Smear-microscopy, adenosine deaminase (ADA), interferon gamma (IFN-?), and Xpert MTB/RIF [using an unprocessed (1 ml) and centrifuged (~20 ml) sample] test accuracy was evaluated in pleural fluid from 103 consecutive patients with suspected pleural TB. Culture for M.tuberculosis and/or histopathology (pleural biopsy) served as the reference standard. Patients were followed prospectively to determine their diagnostic categorisation.Of 93 evaluable participants, 40 had definite-TB (reference positive), 5 probable-TB (not definite but treated for TB) and 48 non-TB (culture and histology negative, and not treated for TB). Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) was 22.5% (12.4 - 37.6) and 98% (89.2 - 99.7), respectively, and centrifugation did not improve sensitivity (23.7%). The Xpert MTB/RIF internal positive control showed no evidence of inhibition. Biomarker specific sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPVs were: ADA (48.85 IU/L; rule-in cut-point) 55.3% (39.8 - 69.9), 95.2% (83.9 - 98.7), 91.4 (73.4 - 95.4), 69.7% (56.7 - 80.1); ADA (30 IU/L; clinically used cut-point) 79% (63.7 - 89), 92.7% (80.6 - 97.5), 91.0 (73.4 - 95.4), 82.7% (69.3 - 90.1); and IFN-? (107.7 pg/ml; rule-in cut-point) 92.5% (80.2 - 97.5), 95.9% (86.1 - 98.9), 94.9% (83.2 - 98.6), 93.9% (83.5 - 97.9), respectively (IFN-? sensitivity and NPV better than Xpert [p < 0.05] and rule-in ADA [p < 0.05]).The usefulness of Xpert MTB/RIF to diagnose pleural TB is limited by its poor sensitivity. IFN-? is an excellent rule-in test and, compared to ADA, has significantly better sensitivity and rule-out value in a TB-endemic setting.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708530","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.884779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Nucleic acid","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.844339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.737676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.716144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.706012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.657294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.655041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.617026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.597618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Centrifugation","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.492058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.396679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.318273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.315437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Adenosine deaminase","weight":0.20609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_deaminase"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Interferon-gamma","weight":0.0635535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon-gamma"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0479091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Centrifuge","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifuge"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Deamination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deamination"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"}]}
