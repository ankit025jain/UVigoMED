{"id":22013,"title":"Vaccines for Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a long and winding road.","abstract":"Despite the recognition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as an opportunistic pathogen, no vaccine against this bacteria has come to market. This review describes the current state-of-the-art in vaccinology for this bacterium. This includes a discussion of those at risk for infection, the types of vaccines and the approaches for empirical and targeted antigen selection under development, as well as a perspective on where the field should go. In addition, the challenges in developing a vaccine for those individuals at risk are discussed.
