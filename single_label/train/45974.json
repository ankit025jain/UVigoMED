{"id":45974,"title":"A prospective, randomized, controlled study of ?-3 fish oil fat emulsion-based parenteral nutrition for patients following surgical resection of gastric tumors.","abstract":"Nutrients such as ?-3 fatty acids including fish oil components eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) suppress the growth and promote apoptosis of tumor cells, improve immune function and reduce the effects of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We sought to investigate the effect of ?-3 fish oil fat emulsion-based parenteral nutrition (PN) on nutritional state, immune function, inflammatory reaction, expression of tumor factors and complication incidence in patients after surgical resection of gastric cancer.Forty-eight patients after surgical operation of gastric tumor in hospital were randomly divided into the control group and intervention group. Patients in both groups were treated with iso-nitrogen and iso-caloric parenteral nutrition support. In addition, the intervention group received ?-3 fish oil fat emulsion and the control group received soybean oil. The indicators of nutrition, immune function and inflammation in the two groups were detected on the day before the operation and postoperative day 6. The rate of complication was compared between the two groups.There was no significant difference in nutritional state, liver function and renal function between the two groups (P?>?0.05). However, the levels of inflammatory markers were significantly decreased (P?<?0.01), and the rate of complication was also decreased in the intervention group as compared with the control group.?-3 fish oil fat emulsion-based parenteral nutrition alleviates the inflammatory reaction and reduces the rate of inflammatory complications.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Digestive System
