{"id":62509,"title":"Polymorphisms in microRNA-related genes are associated with survival of patients with T-cell lymphoma.","abstract":"Elaborate evaluation of prognosis of T-cell lymphoma (TCL) is vital for current therapy and future stratified and individualized therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cancer development and prognosis. We aimed to assess the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA-related genes on the survival of patients with TCL.We genotyped 13 SNPs selected from 12 miRNA-related genes in 220 TCL patients and explored the association of SNPs with survival.Among the 13 SNPs, four (DROSHA rs6877842, DICER rs3742330, mir149 rs2292832, and mir499 rs3746444) were significantly associated with TCL survival after adjusting for subtype and International Prognostic Index score. In stratified analyses, all four SNPs remained significantly associated with survival in patients with mature T type. Of the four SNPs, only mir149 rs2292832 was not significantly associated with survival in patients with an International Prognostic Index score of 0-1. Furthermore, a dose-dependent cumulative effect of the four SNPs on TCL survival was observed by counting the number of unfavorable genotypes. Survival tree analysis also showed higher order interactions between these SNPs.The results suggested that miRNA-related polymorphisms are associated with survival of TCL patients; thus, they may be used individually and jointly to predict survival of patients with TCL.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563077","annotations":[{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.728281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.683877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.658821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.608877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Dicer","weight":0.443794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.40668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.368227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Obshchina","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obshchina"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
