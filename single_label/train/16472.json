{"id":16472,"title":"Biofilms formed by Candida albicans bloodstream isolates display phenotypic and transcriptional heterogeneity that are associated with resistance and pathogenicity.","abstract":"Candida albicans infections have become increasingly recognised as being biofilm related. Recent studies have shown that there is a relationship between biofilm formation and poor clinical outcomes in patients infected with biofilm proficient strains. Here we have investigated a panel of clinical isolates in an attempt to evaluate their phenotypic and transcriptional properties in an attempt to differentiate and define levels of biofilm formation.Biofilm formation was shown to be heterogeneous; with isolates being defined as either high or low biofilm formers (LBF and HBF) based on different biomass quantification. These categories could also be differentiated using a cell surface hydrophobicity assay with 24 h biofilms. HBF isolates were more resistance to amphotericin B (AMB) treatment than LBF, but not voriconazole (VRZ). In a Galleria mellonella model of infection HBF mortality was significantly increased in comparison to LBF. Histological analysis of the HBF showed hyphal elements intertwined indicative of the biofilm phenotype. Transcriptional analysis of 23 genes implicated in biofilm formation showed no significant differential expression profiles between LBF and HBF, except for Cdr1 at 4 and 24 h. Cluster analysis showed similar patterns of expression for different functional classes of genes, though correlation analysis of the 4 h biofilms with overall biomass at 24 h showed that 7 genes were correlated with high levels of biofilm, including Als3, Eap1, Cph1, Sap5, Plb1, Cdr1 and Zap1.Our findings show that biofilm formation is variable amongst C. albicans isolates, and categorising isolates depending on this can be used to predict how pathogenic the isolate will behave clinically. We have shown that looking at individual genes in less informative than looking at multiple genes when trying to categorise isolates at LBF or HBF. These findings are important when developing biofilm-specific diagnostics as these could be used to predict how best to treat patients infected with C. albicans. Further studies are required to evaluate this clinically.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24996549","annotations":[{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Amphotericin B","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin_B"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Hydrophobe","weight":0.812875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.79047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Hypha","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.640761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.619035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.541329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.511841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.510143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.506431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biomass","weight":0.493184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.488618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.459372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.364101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.138896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Voriconazole","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voriconazole"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Galleria mellonella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_mellonella"},{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Polygene","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygene"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
