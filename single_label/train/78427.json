{"id":78427,"title":"[The cervical dermatoglyphic character of 229 Chinese patients and its application in incision design for the cervical lymph nodes dissection].","abstract":"To summarize the cervical dermatoglyphics distribution in 229 participants, and to design dermatoglyphic incision for cervical lymph nodes dissection, including II , III, IV or/and V regions, in accordance with the requirement for cosmetology.To keep the patient's head right forward when the number and locations of the dermatoglyphy were collected by macroscopic observation. Upper Cricoid-Region is defined as the region above the cricoids, and Cricoids-Collarbone-Region is referred to the region below the cricoids. The relationship among the distribution of cervical dermatoglyph, patients' age, gender, and body mass index were analyzed. According to the distribution of cervical dermatoglyph, when performing the regional cervical lymph nodes dissection in patients with laryngocarcinoma and thyroid cancer, cervical dermatoglyphy incision or parallel dermatoglyphy incision were designed, and the operation time, operative complications, and cosmetology effects after surgery were observed.Distribution of cervical dermatoglyphics was statistically correlated to the age, gender, and body mass index (P < 0.05) of patients. The follow-up time were 12 months to 49 months, 19 months on average. Average operating time of unilateral lymph nodes dissection was (46 +/- 12) minutes. Patients undergone the designs of cervical dermatoglyphy incision or parallel dermatoglyphy incision, suffered neither skinflap necrosis nor accessory nerve injury. One patient had lymphatic fistula after surgery, and relieved by conservative treatment. One with T3 N2 M0 laryngocarcinoma got V region lymph nodes recurrence 6-months after surgery.The cervical lymph nodes dissection with dermatoglyphy design is safe with prominent cosmetology effects. It will take a little longer time to perform the neck dissection with the dermatoglyphy incision in the beginning.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669692","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.809422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.548361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.516807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.456903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.443527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.385106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cervical lymph nodes","weight":0.344604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.332137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.324274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.323266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.310119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.189899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.134133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"China","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Accessory nerve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_nerve"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"}]}
