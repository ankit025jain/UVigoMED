{"id":88401,"title":"Acromioclavicular joint dislocation with associated brachial plexus injury.","abstract":"We present the case of a 32-year-old female who sustained a left acromioclavicular (AC) joint type V injury and brachial plexus injury. The patient's AC joint injury was identified 6?days after she was involved in a motorbike accident where she sustained multiple other injuries. She required operative fixation of the AC joint using a locking compression medial proximal tibial plate. At 3?months post operatively, the patient was found to have a subluxed left shoulder as a result of an axonal injury to the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. In addition, the tibial plate had cut out. The plate was subsequently removed. At 8?months the glenohumeral articulation had been restored and the patient had clinically regained significant shoulder function. After 15?months the patient was pain free and could complete all her activities of daily living without impediment. She returned to playing competitive pool after 24?months.
