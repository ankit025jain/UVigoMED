{"id":25758,"title":"[Dynamics of cardiovascular mortality among men and women in subjects of Russian Federation (2002 to 2011)].","abstract":"to study the dynamics of CVD mortality in men and women in the Russian Federation (RF) for the period from 2002 to 2011.The study was performed on the basis of official statistics \"Rosstat\". Results. In 2011 the average death rate from CVD for the regions of the Russian Federation among men and women was significantly lower than in 2002 (p<0.0001). Average mortality from CVD among women was lower than among men (p<0.0001). Factors of time and gender were statistically significant (p<0.0001 ) for changes CVD mortality in the subjects of the Russian Federation. The mean absolute decrease in CVD mortality among men in Russia amounted to -39.7; among women - 24.9. In regions with 2002 CVD mortality in men above 1000 the mean absolute decrease was -41.1+/-15.1 while in regions with 2002 CVD mortality below 1000 mean absolute decrease was -22.1+/-11.8 (p=0.001). At the same time, in 39 subjects the downward trend in performance was unstable, between-year differences were substantial, especially among male population.During the period 2002-2011 decline of CVD mortality of men and women was recorded in all regions of Russia. At the same time, given the significant variation of figures and high probability of inadequate coding of causes of death additional research is needed in one-year age groups using the RF subjects uniform criteria of causes of death.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177779","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.828829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.710373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.671519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.582906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.563672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.417786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.238516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.056379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Official statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_statistics"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.01992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Absolute monarchy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Federation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation"},{"name":"Subdivisions of Russia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Russia"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Goskomstat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goskomstat"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"}]}
