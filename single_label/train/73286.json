{"id":73286,"title":"Propensity-matched, longitudinal outcomes analysis of complications and cost: comparing abdominal free flaps and implant-based breast reconstruction.","abstract":"Choosing a breast reconstructive modality after mastectomy is an important step in the reconstructive process. The authors hypothesized that autologous tissue is associated with a greater success rate and cost efficacy over time, relative to implant reconstruction.A retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing free tissue (FF) transfer and expander implant (E/I) reconstruction between 2005 and 2011. Variables evaluated included comorbidities, surgical timing, complications, overall outcomes, unplanned reoperations, and costs. A propensity-matching technique was used to account for the nonrandomized selection of modality.A total of 310 propensity-matched patients underwent 499 reconstructions. No statistically significant differences in preoperative variables were noted between propensity-matched cohorts. Operative characteristics were similar between FF and E/I reconstructions. The E/I reconstruction was associated with a significantly higher rate of reconstructive failure (5.6% vs 1.2%, p < 0.001). Expander implant reconstructions were associated with higher rates of seroma (p = 0.009) and lower rates of medical complications (p = 0.02), but overall significantly higher rates of unplanned operations (15.5% vs 5.8%, p = 0.002). The total cost of reconstruction did not differ significantly between groups ($23,120.49 ± $6,969.56 vs $22,739.91 ± $9,727.79, p = 0.060), but E/I reconstruction was associated with higher total cost for secondary procedures ($10,157.89 ± $8,741.77 vs $3,200.71 ± $4,780.64, p < 0.0001) and a higher cost of unplanned revisions over time (p < 0.05).Our matched outcomes analysis does demonstrate a higher overall, 2-year success rate using FF reconstruction and a significantly lower rate of unplanned surgical revisions and cost. Although autologous reconstruction is not ideal for every patient, these findings can be used to enhance preoperative discussions when choosing a reconstructive modality.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916480","annotations":[{"name":"Mastectomy","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy"},{"name":"Breast reconstruction","weight":0.842785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reconstruction"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.714257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.607639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.53624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Seroma","weight":0.407951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.371877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.356336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.324271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.2457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"741","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/741"},{"name":"780","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/780"},{"name":"969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/969"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"739","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/739"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Expander graph","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Total cost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost"},{"name":"Variable and attribute (research)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_and_attribute_(research)"}]}
