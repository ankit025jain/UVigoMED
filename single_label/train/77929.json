{"id":77929,"title":"Full thickness cartilage palisade tympanoplasty with malleus interposition: a study of the long term results.","abstract":"The aim of this retrospective study is to review long term results of full-thickness cartilage palisade tympanoplasty (FTCPT) with malleus head interposition performed on 51 patients (56 ears); 36 women and 15 men (7-73 years, 44 years average). The pathology of ears which encourages this technique of tympanoplasty is presented. On average 12 years after surgery we have elaborated anatomic and functional results. Anatomic results were categorized based on empiric evaluation of the new tympanic membrane status: 40 (71%) tympanic membranes without anatomic irregularities, 14 (25%) with irregularities and 2 (4%) with secondary perforation. Functional results (tonal audiogram) are based on pure tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG) at 4 frequencies. Main functional results of 51 ears (51 audiograms performed): pre- and post-operative average PTA-ABGs were 27.07 +/- 9.98 and 10.77 +/- 7.85 dB (t = 10.36; p < 0.001). In the group of ears with a tympanic membrane with no anatomic irregularities, pre- and post-operative average PTA-ABGs were 27.30 +/- 10.56 and 10.82 +/- 8.33 dB (t = 8.09; p < 0.001). In the group of ears with cartilage resorption, pre- and post-operative PTA-ABGs were 24.92 +/- 8.19 and 9.33 +/- 6.58 dB (t = 6.21; p < 0.001). The differences between the two groups are irrelevant. Postoperative PTA-ABG values of ears after first surgery (N = 34) and revision surgery (N = 17) was significantly different (8.75 +/- 5.75 and 15.16 +/- 9.62 dB) (t = 2.60; p = 0.016). In spite of the thickness of the new tympanal membrane, FTCPT is a successful technique for solving advanced ear pathology.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851631","annotations":[{"name":"Eardrum","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.58982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.492566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Malleus","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus"},{"name":"Audiogram","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiogram"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.399122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.234035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Palisade","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisade"},{"name":"Pure tone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_tone"},{"name":"Tympanoplasty","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanoplasty"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Pitch (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Tonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Interposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interposition"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Tensor tympani muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
