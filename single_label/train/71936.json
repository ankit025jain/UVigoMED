{"id":71936,"title":"[Mechanisms of resistance to molecular targeted drugs].","abstract":"Cancer treatments have gradually improved during past decades. However, we are still facing problems to surmount in prevention and therapy of cancers. Recent advances in molecular-based understanding of cell proliferation and survival have provided the rationale for the molecular targeted therapy to control cancer. Contrary to our expectation, molecular targeted drugs, such as EGFR-, ALK-, ROS1-, or BRAF-targeted drugs, could not exhibit sufficient curative effects. This review aims to provide an overview of the recent progress in the development of kinase-targeted drugs and the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of pre-existent (intrinsic) and acquired drug resistance.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016819","annotations":[{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.709789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.653936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.595466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.503506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.290321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0229663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Expected value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"},{"name":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_lymphoma_kinase"}]}
