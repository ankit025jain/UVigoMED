{"id":84369,"title":"Zinc finger MYND-type containing 8 promotes tumour angiogenesis via induction of vascular endothelial growth factor-A expression.","abstract":"Zinc finger, MYND-type containing 8 (ZMYND8) encodes a receptor for activated C-kinase protein. Here, we report that ZMYND8 promotes angiogenesis in prostate cancer xenografts in zebrafish, as well as tube formation in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures. Using transcriptome analyses, we found upregulation of ZMYND8 expression in both zebrafish prostate cancer xenografts and prostate cancer samples from patients. In vitro and in vivo ZMYND8 knockdown suppressed angiogenesis, whereas ZMYND8 overexpression enhanced angiogenesis. Notably, ZMYND8 induced vegfa mRNA expression selectively in prostate cancer xenografts. Integrated analysis of human and zebrafish transcriptomes, which identified ZMYND8, might be a powerful strategy to determine also other molecular targets for inhibiting prostate cancer progression.
