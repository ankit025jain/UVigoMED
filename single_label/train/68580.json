{"id":68580,"title":"Nuclear factor-?B signaling pathway is involved in phospholipase C?-regulated proliferation in human renal cell carcinoma cells.","abstract":"Phospholipase C? (PLC?), a downstream effector of small GTPase superfamily, has been identified to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Previously, our studies have showed that PLC? promotes proliferation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PLC? enhances the survival phenotype of RCC cells are still not fully instructed. In the present study, we first demonstrated that PLC? was highly expressed and had a close correlation with Ki67 protein expression in RCC tissue samples. Further, we found that downregulation of PLC? expression repressed growth and induced apoptosis in RCC cells. In addition, we reported a mechanism by which knockdown of PLC? gene potently suppressed the nuclear factor kappa (NF-?B) signaling pathway through action on inhibitor of ?B kinase. Moreover, silencing PLC? gene decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, which was a downstream growth factor of NF-?B signaling pathway. Finally, downregulation of VEGF was severely enhanced by treatment cells with NF-?B specific inhibitor BAY11-7028 in PLC? knockdown cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that PLC? promotes RCC cell growth via NF-?B-mediated upregulation of VEGF.
