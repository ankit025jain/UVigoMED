{"id":72940,"title":"miR-96/HBP1/Wnt/?-catenin regulatory circuitry promotes glioma growth.","abstract":"We found that miR-96 is overexpressed in glioma, and its level inversely correlates with the survival of patients. The reduction in miR-96 abundance suppresses the proliferation and colony formation of glioma cells. The tumorigenicity of U-87 MG cells is reduced by miR-96 silencing. miR-96 contributes to the activation of Wnt/?-catenin pathway in glioma cells. HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP-1), a Wnt/?-catenin pathway inhibitor, is suppressed by miR-96. The reactivation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling causes an increase in the proliferation of glioma cells, and a decrease in miR-96 expression. On the other hand, HBP1 silencing promotes miR-96 expression. Collectively, miR-96 contributes to the progression of glioma by enhancing the activation of the Wnt/?-catenin pathway, and the miR-96/HBP1/Wnt/?-catenin regulatory circuitry promotes the proliferation of glioma cells.
