{"id":58977,"title":"Metabolomics profiling for identification of novel potential markers in early prediction of preeclampsia.","abstract":"The first aim was to investigate specific signature patterns of metabolites that are significantly altered in first-trimester serum of women who subsequently developed preeclampsia (PE) compared to healthy pregnancies. The second aim of this study was to examine the predictive performance of the selected metabolites for both early onset [EO-PE] and late onset PE [LO-PE].This was a case-control study of maternal serum samples collected between 8+0 and 13+6 weeks of gestation from 167 women who subsequently developed EO-PE n?=?68; LO-PE n?=?99 and 500 controls with uncomplicated pregnancies. Metabolomics profiling analysis was performed using two methods. One has been optimized to target eicosanoids/oxylipins, which are known inflammation markers and the other targets compounds containing a primary or secondary biogenic amine group. Logistic regression analyses were performed to predict the development of PE using metabolites alone and in combination with first trimester mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements.Two metabolites were significantly different between EO-PE and controls (taurine and asparagine) and one in case of LO-PE (glycylglycine). Taurine appeared the most discriminative biomarker and in combination with MAP predicted EO-PE with a detection rate (DR) of 55%, at a false-positive rate (FPR) of 10%.Our findings suggest a potential role of taurine in both PE pathophysiology and first trimester screening for EO-PE.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873829","annotations":[{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.836937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.746694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Biogenic amine","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenic_amine"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.36748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Metabolomics","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics"},{"name":"Asparagine","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.328241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Taurine","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Mean arterial pressure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_arterial_pressure"},{"name":"Glycylglycine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycylglycine"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Program optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Discriminative model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminative_model"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Predictive inference","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Biogenic substance","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenic_substance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
