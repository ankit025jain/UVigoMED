{"id":77669,"title":"Man-made mineral fibers and interstitial lung diseases.","abstract":"Manufactured (artificial) fibers represent an important and continuously growing volume among substitutes to natural fibers. A major proportion of the population in an industrialized society has been, is, or will be in contact with these fibers. The fibrous configuration of asbestos is well recognized as being an important parameter in toxicity, and now that of synthetic fibers is also suspected of inducing serious health effects on the respiratory system. There is an ongoing debate about the actual fibrogenic effect of these man-made mineral fibers (MMMFs) in humans.Several case reports have demonstrated the biopersistance of MMMFs in the lung of workers who were exposed to rock wool or fiberglass for long periods of time and were diagnosed with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. A 20-year follow up also identified refractory ceramic fibers in workers' lung tissue, with significant association between cumulative fiber exposure and radiographic pleural changes. Newly emerging man-made fiber industries appear to induce new types of occupational diseases.Exposure of workers in MMMFs production plants is correlated to high risk for developing pneumoconiosis. Large epidemiological studies are needed in order to determine dose metrics for risk assessment and management.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Occupational
