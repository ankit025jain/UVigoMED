On physical examination there was no perceivable trauma to the chest. In addition, there were no clinical symptoms that suggested this serious injury. The patient was managed with successful stent-graft placement on an elective basis.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495347","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.5758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Motorcycle","weight":0.54175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.473334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.464956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.305285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.145853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.111952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Brachiocephalic artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachiocephalic_artery"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"}]}
