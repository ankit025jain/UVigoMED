{"id":32278,"title":"Supratentorial neurenteric cyst--a case report.","abstract":"Supratentorial neurenteric cyst is a rare congenital lesion. We report here a case of a 33-year-old female who presented with seizures. A multicystic lesion in the left premotor cortex with moderate contrast enhancement was demonstrated with MRI. Microscopically, the lesion showed small cystic structures filled with a proteinaceous fluid. The wall of the cysts was lined with a single layer of ciliated columnar or cuboidal epithelium on a basement membrane. Glandular structures resembling gastrointestinal glands were also present. The cells of the cyst lining and glandular structures revealed strongly positive immunoreactions for epithelial markers (cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen).
