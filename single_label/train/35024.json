{"id":35024,"title":"Craniosynostosis surgery: the legacy of Paul Tessier.","abstract":"Paul Louis Tessier is recognized as the father of craniofacial surgery. While his story and pivotal contributions to the development of the multidisciplinary practice of craniofacial surgery are much highlighted in plastic surgery literature, they are seldom directly discussed in the context of neurosurgeons. His life and legacy to craniosynostosis and neurosurgery are explored in the present paper.
