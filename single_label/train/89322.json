{"id":89322,"title":"An evolutionary perspective on the history of flap reconstruction in the upper extremity.","abstract":"Examining the evolution of flap reconstruction of the upper extremity is similar to studying the evolution of biological species. This analogy provides a perspective to appreciate the contributing factors that led to the development of the current arsenal of techniques. It shows the trajectory for the future and provides a glimpse of the factors that that will be influential in the future.
