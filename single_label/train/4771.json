{"id":4771,"title":"[Knowledge, attitudes and practices of household heads regarding rabies in the Abobo district (Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire) in 2008].","abstract":"In order to investigate the factors predisposing to human rabies in Abobo, we conducted a study to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of household heads in this district.This cross-sectional study was conducted from 13 September to 13 December 2008 and consisted of interviewing, by means of a questionnaire, household heads or their representatives at home. We randomly selected 53 households in each sub-district, with a total of 702 households for the 13 sub-districts. Informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to the interview. Data were analysed using Epi-Info 2000.Of the total of 152 households, 22% had a pet; 109 (71.7%) households had a dog, that was not vaccinated in 38% of cases. Furthermore, 577 (82.19%) of household heads knew about rabies and school was the source of information for 511 households (88.6%). Five hundred fifty five household heads (96.18%) did not know that the wound should be washed with soap and water immediately after exposure and 118 household heads (20.45%) reported that nothing should be done after a bite. After exposure, only 30.70% of household heads would attend a health centre 50 kilometres from home.This study shows a good level of knowledge of household heads concerning rabies. However, harmful health practices persist. Public awareness of rabies therefore needs to be reinforced.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25380270","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.439494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.322201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.258641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Rabies","weight":0.219715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Pet","weight":0.158784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.152786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"School","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Kilometre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Abobo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abobo"},{"name":"Abidjan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abidjan"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"December 13","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_13"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"577","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/577"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Soap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"702 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/702_(band)"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Subdistrict (China)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdistrict_(China)"}]}
