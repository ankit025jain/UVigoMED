{"id":53851,"title":"Endocrine basis for recurrent pregnancy loss.","abstract":"Common endocrinopathies are a frequent contributor to spontaneous and recurrent miscarriage. Although the diagnostic criteria for luteal phase defect (LPD) is still controversial, treatment of patients with both recurrent pregnancy loss and LPD using progestogen in early pregnancy seems beneficial. For patients who are hypothyroid, thyroid hormone replacement therapy along with careful monitoring in the preconceptual and early pregnancy period is associated with improved outcome. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased risk of pregnancy loss. Management of PCOS with normalization of weight or metformin seems to reduce the risk of pregnancy loss.
