{"id":53716,"title":"[Endometriosis and endometriosis-related ovarian neoplasms].","abstract":"Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent, chronic gynecological disorder. Although endometriosis is a benign lesion, it shares several common characteristics with invasive cancer. Numerous epidemiologic studies indicate, that endometriosis patients have an increased risk of clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancer. There is an intermediary lesion between endometriosis and malignant neoplasms - \"atypical endometriosis\". Genetic factors play a role in the malignant transformation through pathways related to oxidative stress, inflammation and hyperestrogenism.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501879","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.812699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.791454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.730952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Malignant transformation","weight":0.691873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_transformation"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.302906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Endometrioid tumor","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrioid_tumor"}]}
