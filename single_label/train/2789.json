{"id":2789,"title":"Initial experience with a new refractive rotationally asymmetric multifocal intraocular lens.","abstract":"To assess efficacy, safety, predictability, and patient satisfaction after refractive lens exchange with a new refractive rotational asymmetric multifocal intraocular lens.One hundred six eyes of 53 patients after bilateral refractive lens exchange with the SBL-3 lens (Lenstec, Inc., Christ Church, Barbados) implantation were evaluated. The mean preoperative refractive sphere was +1.06 ± 2.63 diopters (D) (range: -8.25 to +5.00 D) and the mean refractive cylinder was -0.51 ± 0.46 D (range: -2.00 to 0.00 D). Monocular and binocular uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected and distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity, uncorrected and distance-corrected near visual acuity, defocus curve, and patient satisfaction were evaluated 3 months postoperatively.At 3 months, 84.9% (90 eyes) were within ±0.50 D of emmetropia. The mean postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity was -0.03 ± 0.09 logMAR (6/6 Snellen) monocularly and -0.08 ± 0.08 logMAR (6/4.8 Snellen) binocularly. The mean monocular and binocular uncorrected near visual acuity were 0.12 ± 0.12 and 0.08 ± 0.10 logMAR (6/7.5 Snellen), respectively. Defocus curve showed a slight drop off for vergences equivalent to intermediate vision. Although some night vision phenomena were reported, overall satisfaction was high. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred in this study.The new refractive rotationally asymmetric intraocular lens provided good range of vision for near, intermediate, and distance. Long-term follow-ups are necessary to evaluate the performance of this intraocular lens.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375850","annotations":[{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.812073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Binocular vision","weight":0.684793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.643089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Defocus aberration","weight":0.543645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defocus_aberration"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.453168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.391766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Night vision","weight":0.374227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_vision"},{"name":"Monocular","weight":0.364652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocular"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.0534202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Barbados","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados"},{"name":"Christ Church, Barbados","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church,_Barbados"},{"name":"Emmetropia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmetropia"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Progressive lens","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_lens"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Christ Church, Oxford","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church,_Oxford"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Catholic Church","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"},{"name":"Society of Biblical Literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Biblical_Literature"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Predictability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability"},{"name":"Jesus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Earth's rotation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_rotation"}]}
