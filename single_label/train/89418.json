{"id":89418,"title":"Fragility fractures requiring special consideration: vertebral fractures.","abstract":"The treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures is complicated because of the comorbid conditions of the elderly patient. Underlying osteoporosis leads to malalignment of the weakened bone and impedes fracture fixation. The treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures is widely empirical, because standardized and accepted treatment evidence-based concepts are missing for certain fracture types. As in other osteoporotic fractures in the elderly, the key for good outcome may be a combination of interdisciplinary treatment approaches and adapted surgical procedures. This article gives an overview of the underlying problems and possible treatment strategies for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in geriatric patients.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721374","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.6439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.596015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.529513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.183514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.158811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.129837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.10613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Fixation (histology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(histology)"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Autism therapies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_therapies"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
