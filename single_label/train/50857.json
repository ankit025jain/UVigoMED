{"id":50857,"title":"The protective effects of insulin and natural honey against hippocampal cell death in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.","abstract":"We investigated the effects of insulin and honey as antioxidants to prevent the hippocampal cell death in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. We selected sixty Wister rats (5 groups of 12 animals each), including the control group (C), and four diabetic groups (control (D) and 3 groups treated with insulin (I), honey (H), and insulin plus honey (I + H)). Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection (IP, 60 mg/kg). Six weeks after the induction of diabetes, the group I received insulin (3-4 U/kg/day, SC), group H received honey (5 mg/kg/day, IP), and group I + H received a combination of the above at the same dose. Groups C and D received normal saline. Two weeks after treatment, rats were sacrificed and the hippocampus was extracted. Neuronal cell death in the hippocampal region was examined using trypan blue assay, \"H & E\" staining, and TUNEL assay. Cell viability assessment showed significantly lower number of living cells in group D than in group C. Besides, the mean number of living cells was significantly higher in group I, H, and I + H compared to group D. Therefore, it can be concluded that the treatment of the diabetic rats with insulin, honey, and a combination of insulin and honey can prevent neuronal cell death in different hippocampal areas of the studied samples.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745031","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.509679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.461749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.435257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.377849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Honey","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.2865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.186427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Trypan blue","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypan_blue"},{"name":"TUNEL assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUNEL_assay"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Intellectual property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
