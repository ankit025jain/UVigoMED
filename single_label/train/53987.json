{"id":53987,"title":"Predictors for thyroid carcinoma in Israel: a national cohort of 1,624,310 adolescents followed for up to 40 years.","abstract":"Data on adolescent precursors of thyroid cancer in adulthood are scant.In order to evaluate potential risk factors for thyroid cancer, we linked two national data sources: the military recruitment health examinations and the Israel National Cancer Register. The study population (1,624,310 participants) included 1,145,865 Jewish males aged 16-19 years when examined between 1967 and 2005, and 478,445 Jewish females aged 16-19 years when examined between 1989 and 2005. The cancer follow-up extended up to 2006. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was used.During 24,389,502 person years of follow-up, 760 incidence cases of thyroid cancer were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 25.2±4.2 years for women and 37.2±10.0 years for men. Women had a substantially higher incidence (birth cohort-adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=5.70 [95% CI 4.45-7.31]; p<0.001). Height predicted incidence in both sexes, with birth cohort-adjusted HRs of 1.03 (p<0.001) in males and 1.04 (p<0.001) in females, per 1?cm increment in height. In males, but not in females, there was a graded association between education, as measured by years of schooling, and incidence of thyroid cancer. Body mass index was not associated with incidence. In a multivariable analysis of 617,613 males and 469,185 females examined from 1989 onwards, which included sex, birth year, height, and education, the excess risk in females persisted strongly (HR=5.67 [CI 4.30-7.13]), as did the association with height.Female sex, measured height in adolescence, and later birth cohorts were independent predictors of thyroid cancer in young and middle-aged adults in Israel. Further study is needed to unravel the mechanisms whereby height is associated with thyroid cancer.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Endocrine System
