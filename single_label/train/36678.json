{"id":36678,"title":"[Anesthetic management of a neonate with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation].","abstract":"We report the anesthetic management of a female neonate with congenital cyst adenoid malformation (CCAM) type III of the lung who underwent the lower right lobe resection 22 days after birth. General anesthesia was induced with propofol and rocuronium. The trachea was intubated with a 3.0 standard tube. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in an air/oxygen mixture and fentanyl. Intraoperative anesthetic course was uneventful except transient desaturation during lung compression. Immediately, the saturation was restored by interruption of lung compression. One lung ventilation was not necessary in this operation. Postoperative course was uneventful. Patient was discharged home on the 28th postoperative day.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558943","annotations":[{"name":"Sevoflurane","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevoflurane"},{"name":"Pharyngeal tonsil","weight":0.894125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_tonsil"},{"name":"Fentanyl","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Rocuronium bromide","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocuronium_bromide"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.747832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Pulse oximetry","weight":0.724589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.718976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.697633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.558321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_cystic_adenomatoid_malformation"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Right lobe of liver","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_lobe_of_liver"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"}]}
