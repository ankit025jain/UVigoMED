{"id":44006,"title":"Risk of Budd-Chiari syndrome associated with factor V Leiden and G20210A prothrombin mutation: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Various studies have demonstrated that factor V Leiden (FVL) and G20210A prothrombin mutation contribute to the risk of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), while other studies provided conflicting findings. In order to derive more precise estimations of the relationships, a meta-analysis was performed.Eligible articles were identified through search of databases including Pubmed, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM, Chinese), and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, Chinese). Odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random- or fixed- model.Finally, twelve studies were included for FVL and nine studies were included for G20210A prothrombin mutation. With respect to FVL, significantly increased BCS risk was found in the overall population (OR?=?6.29, 95%CI?=?4.23-9.36). Subgroup analyses suggested that FVL was associated with an increased risk of BCS in the population with high background mutation prevalence (>1% in the normal population). No significant association was found between BCS and G20210A prothrombin mutation (OR?=?1.78, 95%CI?=?0.77-4.11).The presence of FVL should be evaluated in patients with BCS. Conversely, G20210A prothrombin mutation is not significantly associated with risk of BCS. Large-scale well designed studies are necessary to be conducted to further confirm or refute the observed association.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755609","annotations":[{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.713543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.557074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.28687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.142983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Leiden","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden"},{"name":"Factor V Leiden","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_V_Leiden"},{"name":"Factor V","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_V"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"774","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/774"},{"name":"239","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/239"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Odd Grenland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Grenland"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Certified Broadcast Meteorologist","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Broadcast_Meteorologist"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Bowl Championship Series","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series"}]}
