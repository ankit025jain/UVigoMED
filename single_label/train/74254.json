{"id":74254,"title":"Bioinformatics screening regarding herbal components that targetedly regulate the function of tumour-associated macrophages.","abstract":"As an important component of tumour stroma, tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumour development and progression. Herbs have been increasingly used in anticancer therapies due to their wide-ranging anticancer effects and minor side-effects. However, no herb-based treatments targeting TAMs have yet been proposed. To address this issue, screening using modular analysis bioinformatics techniques found 6 core functional modules for TAMs that contain 46 total genes. Moreover, 15 potential new anticancer drugs that regulate the genes in the 6 core modules were identified through bioinformatics techniques and Fisher's exact test. Our results provide a new research avenue for targeting TAMs in anticancer therapies.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859918","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.505388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.0722222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Stroma (animal tissue)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_(animal_tissue)"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Advanced Squad Leader Modules","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Squad_Leader_Modules"}]}
