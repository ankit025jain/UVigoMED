{"id":91756,"title":"Enhancement of pediatric ophthalmologic diagnosis with a handheld polarized dermatoscope.","abstract":"In pediatric primary care, an adjunct for ophthalmology diagnosis and monitoring of treatment could be of great advantage. The portable polarized dermatoscope can readily fit the purpose as an alternative to the classic slit lamp device.We describe and demonstrate our clinical experience using the dermatoscope for diverse ocular conditions.Beyond its effective primary role as an examination tool for detecting dermatopathology, the dermatoscope proves its worth in a variety of separate ophthalmologic clinical states where intricate details need recognition. From corneal or subtarsal foreign body identification, to tear gutter assessment, this instrument can facilitate our work whenever magnification and illumination is beneficial.The technique described raises the option of using a substitute for usually lacking, cumbersome equipment for many therapeutic situations, rural clinics and home visits, easily available for the busy pediatrician, demanding little training, and at a reasonable cost.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477712","annotations":[{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.616913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.150717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.114781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Magnification","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification"},{"name":"Slit lamp","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit_lamp"},{"name":"Dermatopathology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatopathology"},{"name":"Dermatoscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatoscopy"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Handheld game console","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Lighting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting"},{"name":"Oil lamp","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_lamp"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Typography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography"}]}
