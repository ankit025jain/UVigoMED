{"id":61465,"title":"[Acquired bleeding disorders - diagnostic approach].","abstract":"Patients with acquired bleeding disorders are often a diagnostic challenge in internal medicine.Which diagnostic work up is necessary in these patients and which coagulation tests are useful?Analysis and diagnostic workup in the daily practice are discussed according to review publications in this field and existing clinical evidence.First important step is the bleeding history of the patient. The different signs of bleeding are important hints for the cause. The global assays Quick (PT) and PTT in combination with platelet count and function reveal a primary knowledge of the kind of the acquired bleeding disorder. In addition special coagulation tests normally lead to the exact diagnosis of the cause of bleeding.Patients with newly developed bleeding symptoms should be examined for acquired coagulation disorders. The clinical sings in combination with the special coagulation tests allow the correct diagnosis.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715274","annotations":[{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.838771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.492859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.489074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Haemophilia","weight":0.365988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.292974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Acquired disorder","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_disorder"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.0229389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Partial thromboplastin time","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_thromboplastin_time"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Sign convention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_convention"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
