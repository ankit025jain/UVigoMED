{"id":19635,"title":"Characteristics of antibiotic resistance and sequence type of Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates in Japan and the antibacterial activity of DS-8587.","abstract":"DS-8587 is a novel broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with extended antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity and mechanism of DS-8587 in 31 quinolone-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. Efflux pump and qnr genes, mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions of target enzymes, and sequence types determined by multilocus sequence typing were analyzed. Forty-two quinolone-susceptible clinical isolates were analyzed for comparison. For susceptibility testing, DS-8587 exhibited more effective antibacterial activity when compared with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. When combined with the efflux pump inhibitor 1-(1-napthylmethyl)-piperazine, the MIC of DS-8587 was less affected when compared with the MIC exhibited by combined ciprofloxacin and 1-(1-napthylmethyl)-piperazine. The efflux pump genes adeA/adeB/adeC and regulatory elements adeR/adeS were detected in 23 of 31 quinolone-resistant isolates. The qnrA/qnrB/qnrS genes were not detected in any A. baumannii isolates analyzed. Mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions were observed in all 31 quinolone-resistant isolates. Multilocus sequence typing analyses revealed that 22 of 31 quinolone-resistant isolates belonged to ST-2, corresponding to international clonal lineage II. In conclusion, DS-8587 exhibits potent antibacterial activity against quinolone-resistant A. baumannii isolates that harbor mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions. In the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor 1-(1-napthylmethyl)-piperazine, no significant changes were observed in the MIC for DS-8587. DS-8587 should be considered as a treatment option for A. baumannii including ST-2 strains that are predominant among the quinolone-resistant A. baumannii isolates found in Japan.
