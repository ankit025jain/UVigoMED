{"id":31147,"title":"Cortisol levels decrease after acute tobacco abstinence in regular smokers.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acute tobacco abstinence on cortisol levels in regular smokers, and whether abstinence-induced changes in cortisol levels are correlated with various signs and symptoms of the tobacco withdrawal syndrome.Smokers (N = 77, ?15 cigarettes/day) attended two counterbalanced sessions (avg = 1 h), one following 12-20 h of abstinence and the other following ad lib smoking. At both sessions, salivary cortisol levels were measured at three time points. Additionally, a battery of self-report questionnaires, physiological assessments, and cognitive performance tasks were administered to measure signs and symptoms of tobacco withdrawal.Salivary cortisol levels were significantly lower during the abstinent session versus the non-abstinent session. No significant associations were found between abstinence-induced changes in cortisol and other tobacco withdrawal measures, although there was suggestive evidence that abstinence-induced changes in cortisol levels and hunger were inversely associated to a modest degree.Acute tobacco abstinence was associated with decreased cortisol levels. Cortisol dampening during acute tobacco abstinence may reflect nicotine-mediated modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, which may be relevant to the maintenance of tobacco dependence. Tobacco-withdrawal cortisol changes do not appear to be a cause or consequence of many manifestations of acute tobacco withdrawal with the possible exception of hunger.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399662","annotations":[{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.644126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.631407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome","weight":0.542572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.517952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.466442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Ad libitum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_libitum"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"1220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1220"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Damping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Performance test (assessment)","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Hunger","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger"}]}
