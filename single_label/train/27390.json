{"id":27390,"title":"Long-term follow-up of elective chronic total coronary occlusion angioplasty: analysis from the U.K. Central Cardiac Audit Database.","abstract":"Chronic total occlusion (CTO) is common, being reported in 18% to 30% of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is usually performed to relieve anginal symptoms, but data are emerging to suggest that there may also be a mortality benefit.This study aimed to compare outcomes of patients with successful versus unsuccessful PCI to a CTO.We analyzed the U.K. Central Cardiac Audit Database for all CTO PCI cases carried out in England and Wales between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009. Vital status in September 2010 was obtained from the Medical Research Information Service.A total of 13,443 patients (78.8% male) had a mean age of 63.5 years and underwent 14,439 CTO procedures. CTO PCI was successful in 10,199 cases (70.6%). During follow-up of 2.65 years (interquartile range: 1.59 to 3.83 years), successful PCI of at least 1 CTO was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.83; p < 0.001). Complete revascularization was associated with improved survival compared with partial revascularization (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.87; p = 0.002) or failed revascularization (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.74; p < 0.001).Successful CTO PCI was associated with improved long-term survival. The improvement was greatest in patients when complete revascularization was achieved. The identity of the successfully treated occluded vessel was not associated with differences in outcome.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034057","annotations":[{"name":"Heart","weight":0.729747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.725677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.639484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.624571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Angina pectoris","weight":0.616645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.592969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.54875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.446629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"England","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Wales","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Coronary occlusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_occlusion"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"England and Wales","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales"},{"name":"Chief technology officer","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"}]}
