{"id":79181,"title":"Laryngeal chondrosarcoma: a population-based analysis.","abstract":"Laryngeal chondrosarcoma (LC) is a rare entity, reportedly comprising less than 1% of all laryngeal tumors. Consequently, the incidence and survival of patients with this slow-growing tumor has been difficult to study. Our objective was to evaluate incidence, organized by patient demographics, as well as long-term survival trends of this malignancy using a population-based database.Retrospective analysis of the United States National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry.The SEER database was searched for patients diagnosed with LC between 1973 and 2010. Data analyzed included patient demographics, incidence, treatment modality, and survival.One-hundred and forty-three cases were identified, representing 0.2% of all laryngeal tumors. Median age at diagnosis was 61.7 years. Men and women constituted 76.2% and 23.8% of patients, respectively. Tumors were locally invasive with 37.7% T4 disease and infrequent regional and distant metastases. The 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year disease-specific survival for LC was 96.5%, 88.6%, and 84.8%, respectively, compared to 88.3%, 68.2%, and 59.3%, respectively for patients with all other laryngeal tumors (P values < 0.01). Relative survival was 94.9% at 1 year, 88.5% at 5 years, and 88.4% at 10 years.This analysis represents the largest LC study sample to date, allowing for evaluation of incidence and long-term survival. LC occurs infrequently, is locally invasive, but only rarely metastasizes. Prognosis for LC is significantly better than for other laryngeal malignancies.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474667","annotations":[{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.796422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Relative survival","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_survival"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.649945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.573664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.4878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Chondrosarcoma","weight":0.307034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrosarcoma"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_Epidemiology_and_End_Results"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1973","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"KVMX","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVMX"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
