{"id":77915,"title":"[Differential diagnosis of headaches].","abstract":"Headache is a frequent symptom in otorhinolaryngology. Such a secondary headache is typically caused by an organic disease in the head and neck area. Much more frequent is primary headache i.e. that an organic cause cannot be found. The most frequent primary headache types are migraine, tension-type headache, and cluster headache. What has to be done when the otorhinolaryngologist cannot find a cause for a headache in the head and neck area? This continuing education article should enable the otorhinolaryngologist to perform a first differential diagnostic exploration. Often a detailed inquiry of the patient's history and a clinical examination are sufficient to decide to which other medical discipline the patient should be referred. Furthermore, the article should enable the reader to capture red flag symptoms, i.e. to catch symptoms accompanying the headache that might be related to underlying and life-threatening disease.
