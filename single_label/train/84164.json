{"id":84164,"title":"Constitutive activation of CaMKK? signaling is sufficient but not necessary for mTORC1 activation and growth in mouse skeletal muscle.","abstract":"Skeletal muscle loading/overload stimulates the Ca²?-activated, serine/threonine kinase Ca²?/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-? (CaMKK?); yet to date, no studies have examined whether CaMKK? regulates muscle growth. The purpose of this study was to determine if constitutive activation of CaMKK? signaling could stimulate muscle growth and if so whether CaMKK? is essential for this process. CaMKK? signaling was selectively activated in mouse muscle via expression of a constitutively active form of CaMKK? using in vivo electroporation. After 2 wk, constitutively active CaMKK? expression increased muscle weight (~10%) and protein content (~10%), demonstrating that activation of CaMKK? signaling can stimulate muscle growth. To determine if active CaMKK? expression stimulated muscle growth via increased mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and protein synthesis, [³H]phenylalanine incorporation into proteins was assessed with or without the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Constitutively active CaMKK? increased protein synthesis ~60%, and this increase was prevented by rapamycin, demonstrating a critical role for mTORC1 in this process. To determine if CaMKK? is essential for growth, muscles from CaMKK? knockout mice were stimulated to hypertrophy via unilateral ablation of synergist muscles (overload). Surprisingly, compared with wild-type mice, muscles from CaMKK? knockout mice exhibited greater growth (~15%) and phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (Thr³??; ~50%), demonstrating that CaMKK? is not essential for overload-induced mTORC1 activation or muscle growth. Collectively, these results demonstrate that activation of CaMKK? signaling is sufficient but not necessary for activation of mTORC1 signaling and growth in mouse skeletal muscle.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159322","annotations":[{"name":"Electroporation","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.837157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Protein biosynthesis","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.748124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mammalian target of rapamycin","weight":0.709004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Threonine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.550542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.549242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.474911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.461764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.31009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Ribosomal protein","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_protein"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Protein S","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_S"},{"name":"Ribosomal s6 kinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_s6_kinase"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Muscle hypertrophy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Strength training","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training"},{"name":"Secretory pathway","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretory_pathway"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Ribosomal protein s6","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_protein_s6"}]}
