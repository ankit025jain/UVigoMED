{"id":36623,"title":"Hereditary multiple exostosis.","abstract":"Hereditary multiple exostosis is an intriguing genetic condition with a clinical impact in the field of orthopaedics, paediatrics and oncology. In this review we highlight the current knowledge about this condition from a clinical and scientific point of view. This gives us more insight into the molecular mechanisms and current models on which therapeutic agents are based. It allows for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of this complex condition. There is currently no exact pathological model that can accurately describe all the findings in the research on Hereditary Multiple Exostosis. Promising treatments with blocking agents are currently under investigation.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563962","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.828539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.621318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.544842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.518045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.386841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"}]}
