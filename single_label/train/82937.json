{"id":82937,"title":"The stability following advancement genioplasty with biodegradable screw fixation.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative stability using biodegradable screws with that of metal plates for fixation of advancement genioplasty. We studied patients who had advancement genioplasty alone or at the same time as other orthognathic surgery including mandibular setback. We assessed the lateral cephalographs at different time points (preoperatively, and 7 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively). A total of 54 patients were enrolled and 27 patients were assigned to each group. The position of pogonion was stable 12 months postoperatively, and the amount of skeletal advancement was reflected in soft tissue close to 100%. There were no clinical differences between biodegradable screws and conventional metal plates used for fixation. Biodegradable fixation for advancement genioplasty is a good option for patients who would require a second operation for removal of the plates.
