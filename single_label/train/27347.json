{"id":27347,"title":"Urinary composition during decongestive treatment in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.","abstract":"The urinary composition, including sodium (Na(+)) and chloride (Cl(-)) concentrations, might provide useful information in addition to urine output during decongestive treatment in heart failure.Consecutive patients with heart failure (n=61), ejection fraction ?45%, worsening symptoms, and scheduled treatment with intravenous loop diuretics were included. Patients received protocol-driven therapy until complete decongestion, assessed clinically and by echocardiography. Three consecutive 24-hour urinary collections were performed. With 2 mg (1-4 mg), 1 mg (0-2 mg), and 1 mg (0-1 mg) bumetanide administered in bolus during consecutive 24-hour intervals, in addition to combinational diuretic therapy in ?70% and both oral spironolactone and vasodilators in ?90%, euvolemia was reached, often within 24 hours. Urine output was higher during the first when compared with the second or third 24-hour interval (2700 versus 1550 or 1375 mL, respectively; P<0.001), but this was no longer significant after correction for diuretic dose (P=0.263), indicating preserved diuretic efficiency during the study. In contrast, urinary Na(+) and Cl(-) excretion both decreased significantly, even after correction for diuretic dose (P=0.040 and 0.004, respectively), leading to decreasing urinary concentrations with progressive decongestion. After reaching euvolemia, lower urinary Na(+)/Cr and Cl(-)/Cr ratios were both associated with urine output ?1500 mL (area under the curve, 0.830 and 0.826, respectively; P<0.001 for both), in contrast to plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels that were not (area under the curve, 0.515; P=0.735) CONCLUSIONS: The urinary composition during progressive decongestion in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is characterized by a drop in urinary Na(+) and Cl(-) concentrations. The urinary Na(+)/Cr or Cl(-)/Cr ratio might provide insightful information to titrate diuretic therapy.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25037309","annotations":[{"name":"Spironolactone","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spironolactone"},{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Bumetanide","weight":0.788482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumetanide"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.723311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.640434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.636555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.528835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Loop diuretic","weight":0.463202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_diuretic"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.404758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.29073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.266588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.185308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Natriuretic peptide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
