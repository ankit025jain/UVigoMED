{"id":23438,"title":"Ventilator-associated pneumonia due to extensive drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii: risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes.","abstract":"Acinetobacter baumannii is characterized by a rapid development of resistance to the commonly used antimicrobial agents. We investigated the risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by extensive drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB). Clinical parameters and overall in-hospital mortality rates were compared between the VAP with and without XDRAB infection groups. This study showed that VAP caused by XDRAB was not associated with in-hospital mortality. However, it was related to high Simplified Acute Physiology Score II scores and increasing durations of hospital stays.
