{"id":52202,"title":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone and clinical outcomes: the CORONA trial (controlled rosuvastatin multinational study in heart failure).","abstract":"This study sought to examine the association between thyroid status and clinical outcomes in patients in the CORONA (Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure) study.Hypo- and hyperthyroidism were associated with worse clinical outcomes in the SCD-HeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial).In CORONA, 4,987 patients underwent baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement, 237 of which (4.8%) were receiving thyroid replacement therapy (TRT). Patients were classified as euthyroid (TSH: 0.3 to 5.0 ?U/ml, and no TRT), hyperthyroid (<0.3 ?U/ml and no TRT), or hypothyroid (>5.0 ?U/ml and no TRT). The outcome composites of cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF), the components of this composite, and all-cause death were compared among hyperthyroid, hypothyroid, and euthyroid states, using multivariable models adjusting for previously reported prognostic variables.A total of 91.3% of patients were euthyroid, 5.0% were hypothyroid, and 3.7% were hyperthyroid. Compared with euthyroid patients, hypothyroid patients were more likely to have a history of stroke, had worse renal function and higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, were more likely to be treated with an antiarrhythmic drug (or have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator), and were less likely to smoke or be treated with a beta-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker. In univariate analyses, hypothyroidism was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome of CV death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.57; p = 0.008), as well as all-cause death (HR: 1.36; 95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.76; p = 0.004). However, after adjustment for other known predictors of outcome, the associations were weakened, and when NT-proBNP was added to the models, the association between hypothyroidism and all outcomes was eliminated.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622117","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Hypothyroidism","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothyroidism"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.84024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Cardiac arrest","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Beta blocker","weight":0.79695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"},{"name":"Antiarrhythmic agent","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiarrhythmic_agent"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantable_cardioverter-defibrillator"},{"name":"Levothyroxine","weight":0.616108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levothyroxine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.614799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Defibrillation","weight":0.600084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.555046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.538817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.513739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.458977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Rosuvastatin","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosuvastatin"},{"name":"Euthyroid","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyroid"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0183746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Hydrofluoric acid","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
