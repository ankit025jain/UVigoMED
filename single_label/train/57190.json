{"id":57190,"title":"[Bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancy in a spontaneous cycle--a case report].","abstract":"Ectopic pregnancy occurs in 0.5-2% of all pregnancies. A double ectopic pregnancy is very rare and has the incidence of 1 in 725 ectopic pregnancies. We describe a case of a 30-year-old patient with double ectopic pregnancy located in tubas in spontaneous cycle--diagnosed and treated at the Gynecology and Obstetrics Hospital in Walbrzych. The patient had no risk factors for ectopic pregnancy. This case shows that even the diagnosis of an evident ectopic pregnancy cannot exclude the possibility of a double ectopic pregnancy.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219147","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.71795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.660335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.42105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.388889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.346584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Walbrzych","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walbrzych"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/725"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Tubas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubas"}]}
