{"id":52868,"title":"Upregulation of HGF and c-MET is associated with subclinical central lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.","abstract":"Identification of a novel biomarker of subclinical lymph node metastasis (SLNM) in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) could provide important clues regarding SLNM in PTMC. We evaluated the significance of HGF and c-Met expression in surgically removed tumor tissue from PTMC patients as a predictive marker of SLNM.We analyzed the immunohistochemical relationship between HGF and c-Met expression and SLNM in 113 surgically treated PTMC patients with clinically negative nodes presurgery. In addition, we explored whether HGF/c-Met pathway activation enhanced the in vitro migration and invasion of PTC cells.Positive immunohistochemical HGF and c-Met staining was found in 107 (95 %) and 103 (91 %) cases, respectively. The HGF staining distribution was as follows: no staining in 6 cases, weak staining in 43, moderate staining in 55, and strong staining in 9. Of the nine cases with strong HGF staining, eight (89 %) had SLNM. The c-Met staining distribution was as follows: no staining in 10 cases, weak staining in 39, moderate staining in 59, and strong staining in 5. Of the five cases with strong c-Met staining, three (60 %) had SLNM. The presence of SLNM was strongly correlated with HGF and c-Met expression in PTMC in a univariate analysis (P < 0.05). HGF overexpression was also associated with SLNM in a multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). Stimulation with exogenous HGF and constitutive activation of c-Met enhanced the migration and invasion of PTC cells in vitro by enhancing VEGF-A expression.HGF/c-Met pathway activation is associated with SLNM of the central neck in PTMC.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562934","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.841418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.735443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.64351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.464936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.375104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.370781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.302191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.145686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.064482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Hepatocyte growth factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte_growth_factor"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Descent (video game)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Strongly correlated material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material"}]}
