{"id":84700,"title":"Postoperative imaging of phalloplasties and their complications.","abstract":"In this article, we summarize the common phalloplasty indications, surgical techniques, and relevant anatomy. We review the appropriate imaging techniques used in postoperative evaluation of the neophallus and illustrate the postoperative appearance and complications associated with phalloplasty.Phalloplasty is an infrequently encountered yet complex procedure requiring careful postoperative imaging assessment. Modern microsurgical techniques have made free flaps the reference standard in phalloplasty, and the radiologist must be aware of the expected postoperative appearance and complications to appropriately manage these patients.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055266","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.737751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.35914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery (female-to-male)","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery_(female-to-male)"},{"name":"Phalloplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalloplasty"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Drug reference standard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_reference_standard"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"}]}
