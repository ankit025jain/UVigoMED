{"id":76255,"title":"Vitamin D deficiency decreases adiposity in rats and causes altered expression of uncoupling proteins and steroid receptor coactivator3.","abstract":"The vitamin D endocrine system is functional in the adipose tissue, as demonstrated in vitro, in cultured adipocytes, and in vivo in mutant mice that developed altered lipid metabolism and fat storage in the absence of either 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] or the vitamin D receptor. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of vitamin D and calcium on body adiposity in a diet-induced vitamin D deficient rat model. Vitamin D-deficient rats gained less weight and had lower amounts of visceral fat. Consistent with reduced adipose tissue mass, the vitamin D-deficient rats had low circulating levels of leptin, which reflects body fat stores. Expression of vitamin D and calcium sensing receptors, and that of genes involved in adipogenesis such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, fatty acid synthase and leptin were significantly reduced in white adipose tissue of deficient rats compared to vitamin D-sufficient rats. Furthermore, the expression of uncoupling proteins (Ucp1 and Ucp2) was elevated in the white adipose tissue of the deficient rat indicative of higher energy expenditure, thereby leading to a lean phenotype. Expression of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator3 (SRC3), a key regulator of adipogenesis in white adipose tissue was decreased in vitamin D-deficient state. Interestingly, most of the changes observed in vitamin D deficient rats were corrected by calcium supplementation alone. Our data demonstrates that dietary vitamin D and calcium regulate adipose tissue function and metabolism.
