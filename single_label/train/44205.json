{"id":44205,"title":"Cthrc1 overexpression is an independent prognostic marker in gastric cancer.","abstract":"Collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1) was identified as a novel gene expressed in the adventitia and neointima on arterial injury and was found to be overexpressed in several malignant tumors, such as breast cancer and malignant melanoma. However, the expression of Cthrc1 and its role in gastric cancer progression remain unknown. We investigated the expression of the Cthrc1 protein by immunohistochemistry in 30 normal tissues from the control subjects and 166 gastric carcinomas and analyzed its correlation with various clinicopathological features, including patient outcome. Cthrc1 immunoreactivity was overexpressed in gastric carcinoma cases compared with normal tissues (P < .001). High Cthrc1 expression was found in 108 (65.06%) of these 166 carcinomas and was positively correlated with the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage classification, depth of gastric wall invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular space involvement, and recurrence but not with age, tumor site, and carcinoembryonic antigen level. Patients with high Cthrc1 expression had significantly poorer overall survival and disease-free survival compared with patients with low expression of Cthrc1 (P = .001 and P = .002, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that high Cthrc1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with gastric carcinoma (both P = .005). These results showed that high Cthrc1 expression was associated with progression and prognosis of gastric carcinoma.
