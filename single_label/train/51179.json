{"id":51179,"title":"Use of an insulin bolus advisor facilitates earlier and more frequent changes in insulin therapy parameters in suboptimally controlled patients with diabetes treated with multiple daily insulin injection therapy: results of the ABACUS trial.","abstract":"We assessed the impact of using an automated bolus advisor integrated into a blood glucose meter on the timing and frequency of adjusting insulin therapy parameter settings and whether the availability of this technology would increase blood glucose test strip utilization in diabetes patients treated with multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) therapy.The Automated Bolus Advisor Control and Usability Study (ABACUS) trial, a 26-week, prospective, randomized, controlled, multinational study that enrolled 218 type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients, demonstrated that use of an automated insulin bolus advisor helps improve glycemic control in suboptimally controlled, MDI-treated patients. Patient data were assessed to determine when and how often changes in insulin parameter settings occurred during the study. Patient meters were downloaded to determine blood glucose monitoring frequency.One hundred ninety-three patients completed the study: 93 control arm (CNL) and 100 intervention (experimental) arm (EXP). Significantly more EXP (47.5%) than CNL (30.7%) patients received one or more changes in their insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) settings during the study (P=0.0191). Changes in ISF settings occurred earlier and more frequently in EXP than CNL patients throughout the study. A similar trend was seen in changes in insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios. There were no differences in daily self-monitoring of blood glucose frequency [mean (SD)] between CNL and EXP patients: 4.7 (1.5) versus 4.6 (1.3) (P=0.4085).Use of an automated bolus advisor was associated with earlier, more frequent changes in key insulin parameters, which may have contributed to subsequent improvements in glycemic control but without increased glucose test strip utilization.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716820","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose
