{"id":24461,"title":"T cell recognition of non-peptidic antigens in infectious diseases.","abstract":"The immune system has evolved to recognize a wide range of antigenic molecules of self and non-self origin. The stimulatory antigens form complexes with antigen-presenting molecules and directly interact with the T cell receptor (TCR). Peptidic antigens associate with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and therefore, are indicated as MHC-restricted. Non-peptidic antigens do not bind to MHC molecules and are presented by other classes of antigen-presenting molecules. These non-MHC restricted antigens include glycolipid molecules, phosphorylated metabolites of the mevalonate pathway and vitamin B2 precursors. T cells specific for non-peptidic antigens have important roles in host defense against infections, autoimmunity, allergies and tumour immunosurveillance. Hence, understanding the molecular interactions between the antigen presenting cell (APC) and the T cells with non-peptidic specificity is of great relevance. Here, we review current knowledge of this type of T cells, their TCR repertoire, the structural aspects of recognized antigens, the mode of antigen recognition, and their function with special emphasis on their role in infectious diseases.
