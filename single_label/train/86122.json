{"id":86122,"title":"Correlation of salivary alpha amylase level and adenotonsillar hypertrophy with sleep disordered breathing in pediatric subjects.","abstract":"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) can affect the sympathetic adrenomedullary system (SAM). As a biomarker of SAM activity, salivary ?-amylase (sAA) in pediatric subjects was evaluated whether it has any correlation with polysomnographic (PSG) parameters related to SDB.Sixty-seven children who attended our clinic during 1 year were enrolled prospectively and underwent clinical examinations and in-lab polysomnography. The sAA was measured at 2 points--at night before PSG and in the early morning after PSG.Subjects were divided into control (n = 26, apneahypopnea index [AHI] < 1) and OSAS (n = 41, AHI ? 1) groups. The OSAS group was subdivided according to AHI (mild-moderate, 1 ? AHI < 10; severe, AHI ? 10). The sAA subtraction and ratio (p = 0.014 and p < 0.001, respectively) were significantly higher in severe OSAS than in the mild-moderate and control groups. Although oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and AHI were significantly associated with sAA, sAA in the OSAS group was not related to lowest oxygen saturation or adenotonsillar hypertrophy.sAA was well related to polysomnographic (PSG) parameters related to SDB, such as AHI and ODI. Therefore, screening test for sAA in children suspected to have SBD may help to identify OSAS patients from control.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812542","annotations":[{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.784929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.783787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.731501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.669068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.596675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.579715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.259122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Pulse oximetry","weight":0.200612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"One Day International","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International"},{"name":"Salesians of Don Bosco","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesians_of_Don_Bosco"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Apnea-hypopnea index","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea-hypopnea_index"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Surface-to-air missile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Subdivision (land)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_(land)"},{"name":"Alpha wave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave"},{"name":"Subtraction","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Paris Saint-Germain F.C.","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C."},{"name":"Alpha-Amylase","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Amylase"}]}
