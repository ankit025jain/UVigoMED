{"id":84054,"title":"Effect of opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy on the three-dimensional kinematics of the knee.","abstract":"Although it is clear that opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) changes alignment in the coronal plane, which is its objective, it is not clear how this procedure affects knee kinematics throughout the range of joint movement and in other planes. Our research question was: how does opening-wedge HTO change three-dimensional tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics in loaded flexion in patients with varus deformity?Three-dimensional kinematics were assessed over 0째 to 60째 of loaded flexion using an MRI method before and after opening-wedge HTO in a cohort of 13 men (14 knees). Results obtained from an iterative statistical model found that at six and 12 months after operation, opening-wedge HTO caused increased anterior translation of the tibia (mean 2.6 mm, p < 0.001), decreased proximal translation of the patella (mean -2.2 mm, p < 0.001), decreased patellar spin (mean -1.4째, p < 0.05), increased patellar tilt (mean 2.2째, p < 0.05) and changed three other parameters. The mean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index improved significantly (p < 0.001) from 49.6 (standard deviation (sd) 16.4) pre-operatively to a mean of 28.2 (sd 16.6) at six months and a mean of 22.5 (sd 14.4) at 12 months. The three-dimensional kinematic changes found may be important in explaining inconsistency in clinical outcomes, and suggest that measures in addition to coronal plane alignment should be considered.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25183593","annotations":[{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.886079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.679241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.536935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.501841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.432437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Varus deformity","weight":0.161298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varus_deformity"},{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Ontario","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"},{"name":"Coronal plane","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_plane"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Iteration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Horse gait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait"},{"name":"McMaster University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_University"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"0 to 60 mph","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_to_60_mph"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Research question","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_question"},{"name":"Waco 10","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_10"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Spin (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)"},{"name":"Western culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture"}]}
