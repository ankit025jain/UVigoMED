{"id":81352,"title":"A hinged two-part partial denture used in conjunction with severely tilted teeth: a case report.","abstract":"A two-part sectional denture can be a useful treatment option when the presence of severe hard tissue undercuts compromises the provision of a satisfactory conventional prosthesis. This article presents a case report illustrating the effective use of a hinged two-part denture in restoring a mandibular Kennedy Class IV edentulous area. A sectional denture approach was selected because of severe proximal and lingual undercuts.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134363","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.449506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.402661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.280998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.162394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Whitewater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewater"},{"name":"John F.
