{"id":62276,"title":"[Recent advances in therapy of follicular lymphoma].","abstract":"Follicular lymphoma is a common pathological subtypes of lymphoma, it ranked only second to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, accounts for 22% of non Hodgkin's lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a displaying biologically and clinically diverse disease. Patients may present indolent, asymptomatic disease or more aggressive, symptomatic disease with high tumor burden. Decision-making to treat in the frontline is based on histology manifestation, tumor burden and patient symptoms. Treatment for follicular lymphoma includes radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunological therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.Radiation therapy is the first treatment of early stage follicular lymphoma. For advanced follicular lymphoma chemotherapy, chemotherapy combined immunotherapy or immune radiotherapy, stem cell transplantation may be chosen. In recent years, drugs for lymphoma including bortezomib, lenalidomide, Ofatumumab, Epratuzumab and so on, and the therapeutic scheme present more and more update. In this article the advances of treatment for follicular lymphoma are summarzied.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598689","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Autologous stem cell transplantation","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autologous_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.735241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.57335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.555059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.517554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.445523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.199353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.0545903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
