{"id":16244,"title":"Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting proteinÂ 1 inhibition of T-cell receptor signaling depends on its SH3 domain.","abstract":"Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) is an adaptor protein associated with the cytoskeleton that is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells. Mutations in PSTPIP1 cause the rare autoinflammatory disease called pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne. We carried out this study to further our knowledge on PSTPIP1 function in T cells, particularly in relation to the phosphatase lymphoid phosphatase (LYP), which is involved in several autoimmune diseases. LYP-PSTPIP1 binding occurs through the C-terminal homology domain of LYP and the F-BAR domain of PSTPIP1. PSTPIP1 inhibits T-cell activation upon T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 engagement, regardless of CD2 costimulation. This function of PSTPIP1 depends on the presence of an intact SH3 domain rather than on the F-BAR domain, indicating that ligands of the F-BAR domain, such as the PEST phosphatases LYP and PTP-PEST, are not critical for its negative regulatory role in TCR signaling. Additionally, PSTPIP1 mutations that cause the pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne syndrome do not affect PSTPIP1 function in T-cell activation through the TCR.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25040622","annotations":[{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"CD28","weight":0.835104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD28"},{"name":"SH3 domain","weight":0.81075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SH3_domain"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.78599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.732073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"T cell receptor","weight":0.658307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell_receptor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.581051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.562076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Acne vulgaris","weight":0.534824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne_vulgaris"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Co-stimulation","weight":0.284957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-stimulation"},{"name":"Pyogenic","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyogenic"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.142852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"CD2","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD2"},{"name":"Pyoderma gangrenosum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyoderma_gangrenosum"},{"name":"Periodic fever syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_fever_syndrome"},{"name":"Pyoderma","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyoderma"},{"name":"Adapter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
