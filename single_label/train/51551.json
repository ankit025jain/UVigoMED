{"id":51551,"title":"[Transsphenoidal endoscopic endonasal approach for the surgery of pituitary abscess].","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of transsphenoidal endoscopic endonasal approach for the surgery of pituitary abscess.Eighteen pathologically diagnosed pituitary abscess were resected through transsphenoidal endoscopic endonasal approach at Tianjing Huanhu hospital between January 2000 and December 2011.Retrospective analysis was done upon clinical presentations and imaging features. There were 6 males and 12 females. The average age was 48.5 years old and the average disease course was 5.8 years. The typical clinical manifestations included headache (13 cases), pituitary dysfunction (10 cases), Diabetes Insipidus (4 cases) visual interference (8 cases) and fever (4 cases). All cases were resected by transsphenoidal endoscopic endonasal approach with general anesthesia. The postoperative symptoms and follow-up results were recorded.All patients were followed up from 6 months to 6 years. Postoperatively, headache was recovered in 13 cases, visual was improved in 6 cases, hypopituitarism was relieved in 8 cases and polyuria was disappeared in 3 cases. One case was recurrent and cured by transsphenoidal endoscopic endonasal approach.Transsphenoidal endoscopic endonasal approach for the surgery of pituitary abscess is effective.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680331","annotations":[{"name":"Polyuria","weight":0.910935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyuria"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.823548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.549552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Hypopituitarism","weight":0.530976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopituitarism"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.363159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.309577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Nanjing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing"},{"name":"Sphenoid bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone"},{"name":"Missing person","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
