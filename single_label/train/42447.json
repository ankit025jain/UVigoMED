{"id":42447,"title":"Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs (C15-C26) in the Osijek-Baranja County, Croatia.","abstract":"The Institute of Public Health for the Osjek-Baranja County (OBC) has processed the data on cancer patients that were collected from mandatory county hospitals data reports, county bureaus of statistics and the County Register of Deaths. The cancers were defined according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), codes of malignant neoplasms of digestive organs (C15-C26). The aim of this article is to show the size of the problem and the burden of the health care system caused by cancers of the digestive system (C15-C26) in the OBC in the period 2001-2006. This article deals with cancer incidence and mortality data, appertaining age distribution, cancer survival, median age at diagnosis and at death and length of stay in hospitals. The overall incidence and mortality rate from cancer group C15-C26 (101.1 and 80/100,000, respectively, EU standard population) declined in all age groups, comparing the data originating from the 2001-2003 period to the data referring to the 2004-2006 period. The median age at diagnosis of cancer was 67.8 years with a shift of 0.91 year up in second period (the median age in the first period was 67.3 years and in the second one 68.2 years). The median age at diagnosis of cancer in females was 69.7 years while in males was 66.3 years, which represents a difference of 2.9 years in favour of females. The overall relative survival rate of all ages was 23.6%. This figure was slightly bigger for females (24.3%) than for males (23.1%). Concerning all age groups, the number of hospital admissions of males increased during the observation period while the number of hospital admissions of women decreased at the same time. The average length of stay over the six years did not changed significantly. Group of cancer C15-C26 was the most common group of cancers regarding both genders. The five-year relative survival as one of the reliable benchmarks of the quality of the health care system needs to be raised to a great extent in order to come nearer to the EU average within a short period of time.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851601","annotations":[{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.875478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.798491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.773266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.693393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.504445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"ICD-10","weight":0.454238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10"},{"name":"Croatia","weight":0.450248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.269635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Relative survival","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_survival"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Benchmarking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking"},{"name":"Government agency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
