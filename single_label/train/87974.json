{"id":87974,"title":"Physical therapy and splinting after flexor tendon repair in zone II.","abstract":"Early physical therapy and splinting after flexor tendon repair in zone II is very important to improve tendon healing, increase tensile strength, decrease adhesion formation, early return of function and less stiffness and deformity. We conducted a study to observe and record the results of early active mobilization of repaired flexor tendons in zone II.This study reports the results of physical therapy and splinting which was applied to 75 patients with 76 digits after flexor tendon repair in zone II, treated at the Department of Plastic Surgery and Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic, Pristine-Kosovo. Physical therapy and splinting started the first day after surgery and have lasts until week 12. Patients were evaluated with regarding to the range of motion and grip strength. The assessments were done at the 8, 10, 12 weeks and the finale assessments were done after 6 months.Range of motion after 6 months according to the Strickland Classification were excellent in 21.1%, good in 44.7, fair in 11.8% and poor in 22.4%. Grip strength was good in 63.8% of cases.Results of this study shows that using a physical therapy and splinting achieve good results in range of motion, muscle force and early return of function of the hand.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937939","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Ultimate tensile strength","weight":0.719088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.666339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.5241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Grip strength","weight":0.485059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_strength"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.401005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.36286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.342407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0902121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0522101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Annular ligaments of fingers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_ligaments_of_fingers"},{"name":"Friction","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"}]}
