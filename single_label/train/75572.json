{"id":75572,"title":"Perceived exertion at work in women with fibromyalgia: explanatory factors and comparison with healthy women.","abstract":"To investigate perceived exertion at work in women with fibromyalgia.A controlled cross-sectional multi-centre study.Seventy-three women with fibromyalgia and 73 healthy women matched by occupation and physical workload were compared in terms of perceived exertion at work (0-14), muscle strength, 6-min walk test, symptoms rated by Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), work status (25-100%), fear avoidance work beliefs (0-42), physical activity at work (7-21) and physical workload (1-5). Spearman's correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis were conducted.Perceived exertion at work was significantly higher in the fibromyalgia group than in the reference group (p?=?0.002), while physical activity at work did not differ between the groups. Physical capacity was lower and symptom severity higher in fibromyalgia compared with references (p?<?0.05). In fibromyalgia, perceived exertion at work showed moderate correlation with physical activity at work, physical workload and fear avoidance work beliefs (rs?=?0.53-0.65, p?<?0.001) and a fair correlation with anxiety (rs?=?0.26, p?=?0.027). Regression analysis indicated that the physical activity at work and fear avoidance work beliefs explained 50% of the perceived exertion at work.Women with fibromyalgia perceive an elevated exertion at work, which is associated with physical work-related factors and factors related to fear and anxiety.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074026","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.64796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.575943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.512818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.504062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Fibromyalgia","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.191989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.0522387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"721","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/721"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Workload","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"}]}
