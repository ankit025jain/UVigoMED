{"id":77220,"title":"[Screening of obesity, overweight and thinness in a children population in Rome, Italy].","abstract":"Objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of obesity, overweight and thinness in a children population in Rome, Italy.The study sample was created, after informed consent, in a school in Rome, available to the study project. A total of 595 children (289 males, 306 females), aged between 6 to 19 years, underwent following measurements: height and weight, evaluation of body mass index.A normal BMI was recorded in 73.6% of cases. Morbid obesity, obesity, overweight, and thinness grade 1 and 2 prevalence was 1.2%, 4%, 15.3%, 9.2% and 3.8%, respectively, without statistical differences in both genders, except the prevalence of overweight that resulted statistically significant (11.4% females vs. 19.3% males, P<0.05). Differences in the age groups have been found. About 17.2% and 18.7% of children between 7 to 11 years were overweight and obese and about 33.3% and 26.6% between 6 to 8 years thin grade 1 and 2, respectively.The study suggests a prevalence of overweight and obesity in our sample lower than that reported in a recent epidemiological survey carried out on Italy. Attention must be taken to underweight, particularly with regard to the most severe form, as a public health problem for all possible risks correlated. In addition, our study shows the involvement of specific age groups. This finding, if confirmed in a larger population, should be associated with a major attention on specific age groups at risk, in order to plan an appropriate treatment program.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826976","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.805162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.737162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.680893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.601848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"School","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.461754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.38698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.343527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.338326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.32583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.256916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.0348068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
