{"id":70553,"title":"[From exome sequencing to avatar creation: towards « precision oncology »?].","abstract":"According to recent reports, the success rate of targeted therapy directed by \"actionable mutations\" found in tumour DNA is rather low (10 to 20%). Interesting attempts have been made to improve this by establishing mouse \"avatars\" and testing drugs on them. The first results are promising, but the clinical utility of this expensive and cumbersome approach needs to be ascertained by more extensive testing.
