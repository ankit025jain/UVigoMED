{"id":51239,"title":"[CyberKnife based radiosurgery in gynecological oncology--application and preliminary results].","abstract":"CyberKnife based radiosurgery is increasingly becoming the common treatment modality used. The high precision and tumor tracking of the CyberKnife makes it a useful tool in gynecological oncology.The aim of this study was a preliminary evaluation of CyberKnife based radiosurgery effectiveness as a treatment of patients with gynecological malignancies metastases.33 cases of gynecological malignancies metastases (19 patients) treated using CyberKnife (14--endometrium cancer, 12--ovary cancer, 7--cervix cancer; 25 adenocarcinomas, 7 SCC and 1 folliculoma). Between June 2011 and July 2013 we irradiated 16 lymph nodes metastases, 15 liver metastases, 1 bone and 1 mesentery metastasis using a fraction dose of from 6 Gy to 15 Gy (median 12) up to the total dose varied from 8 Gy to 45 Gy (delivered in 1-3 fractions). 21 cases underwent follow up. We analyzed tumor size changes and calculated the percentage of complete regressions and local control (LC) after 6 months.The median of tumor size (mean of three diameters) decreased from 1.6 cm before the treatment to 1.1 cm 6 months later. In the controlled group (21 cases) a 24% of total regressions were noted. 6 month LC was 88% (88% for lymph nodes metastases and 86% for liver metastases).The obtained results permit us to form the conclusion that CyberKnife based radiosurgery is an effective and safe treatment for patients with gynecological malignancies metastases.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712261","annotations":[{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.85772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Radiosurgery","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.745175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.554945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.392032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cyberknife","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberknife"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"}]}
