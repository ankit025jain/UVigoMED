{"id":83092,"title":"Oral health status and oral hygiene habits among children aged 12-13 years in Yangon, Myanmar.","abstract":"We conducted a cross sectional study among children aged 12-13 years in Yongon, Myanmar to assess the oral health status and oral hygiene habits. The studied 220 students were from two high schools, one urban and the other rural. We conducted an oral health examination following WHO criteria and used a self-administrated questionnaire. The prevalence rate of dental caries among the study population was 53.2%. The mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) was 1.7 +/- 2.1 teeth per person (decayed, 1.5 +/- 1.9); missing 0.0 +/- 0.2; filled, 0.1 +/- 0.4). Multivariate analysis revealed significant risk factors for dental caries were: the geographical location of the school (adjusted OR=2.24; 95% CI: 1.01-4.94), occupational status of the father (adjusted OR=2.83; 95% CI: 1.05-7.62) and the child's attitude about dental caries (adjusted OR=2.35; 95% CI: 1.18-4.67). Knowledge and oral hygiene habits were not associated with dental caries. The results of this study suggest the need to change from restoration orientated dentistry to dental public health care services, to reduce of the high level of dental caries in this age group.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450249","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.682137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.624967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.396469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Burma","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.266968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"School","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.161381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.119567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.112458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Publicly funded health care","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Location (geography)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_(geography)"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Yangon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"},{"name":"Ethology","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Dental public health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_public_health"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0141339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
