{"id":54918,"title":"[Ophthalmic pathology in tubalars of the Altai Republic].","abstract":"To study the prevalence and structure of ophthalmic pathology in Tubalars, rural indigenes of the Altai Republic, for the benefit of the eye care system.A total of 673 indigenes (67% of the whole population) aged from 1 month to 88 years, 521 Russians and 316 people of mixed parentage were examined.The general prevalence of eye diseases appeared to be higher in Russian newcomers (2481.75 per thousand) than in Tubalars (1965.82 per thousand), while the lowest proportion was found in the group of mixed parentage (1319.62 per thousand). The structure of ophthalmic pathology in Tubalars was as follows: refractive errors and accommodative disorders (799.40 per thousand), diseases of the conjunctiva (390.79 per thousand), retinal diseases (212.48 per thousand), lens diseases (164.93 per thousand), other ocular pathology and tumors of the auxiliary structures (124.81 per thousand), disorders of the lacrimal system (112.93 per thousand), corneal diseases (87.67 per thousand), strabismus (20.80 per thousand), congenital ocular anomalies (10.40 per thousand), glaucoma (8.91 per thousand), diseases of the vascular tract (8.91 per thousand), and eye injury (2.97 per thousand).The prevalence of eye diseases in the three ethnic groups proves interethnic differences. Tubalars demonstrated intermediate results between Russians (higher rates) and the group of mixed parentage (lower rates), which indicates unequal adaptation of these populations to harsh climatic conditions of the area. The obtained data are fundamental for informed management decision-making on rational distribution of health institutions and allocation of medical personnel and funds among the regions of the country.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098120","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.892155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Strabismus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.796806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Accommodation (eye)","weight":0.453168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_(eye)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.424104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.314406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.173608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Eye injury","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_injury"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0871105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Lacrimal apparatus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_apparatus"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Climate","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Russian language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Russians","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Rationality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
