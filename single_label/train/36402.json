{"id":36402,"title":"Cutting balloon angioplasty for in-stent restenosis of the aortic coarctation in a young boy presenting with systemic hypertension of the upper extremities.","abstract":"An 8.25-year-old boy was incidentally found to have systemic hypertension of the upper extremities. Blood pressures of the upper extremities were 142-150/86-98 mmHg, and those of the lower extremities 110-116/60-66 mmHg. Doppler echocardiography showed in-stent restenosis of the aortic coarctation. Traditional high-pressure balloon angioplasty failed to dilate this inveterate in-stent restenosis. Instead, a cutting balloon angioplasty was performed. The lumen was dilated from 4.80 mm to 7.89 mm. The pressure gradient dropped from 32 mmHg to 9 mmHg. Blood pressures of the upper extremities were 112-116/76-78 mmHg, and those of the lower extremities 100-104/70-72 mmHg. This paper highlights that a cutting balloon angioplasty can serve as a juste milieu to relieve in-stent restenosis of the aortic coarctation when traditional high-pressure balloon angioplasty is debatable.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579444","annotations":[{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.726839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.675831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.527412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.32917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.290911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.166664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Coarctation of the aorta","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarctation_of_the_aorta"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Pressure gradient","weight":0.0968186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient"},{"name":"Restenosis","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restenosis"},{"name":"Doppler effect","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect"},{"name":"Doppler echocardiography","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_echocardiography"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Centrism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Belgian general election, 2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_general_election,_2010"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
