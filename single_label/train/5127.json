{"id":5127,"title":"Management of a carapace fracture in a six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus).","abstract":"An adult female free-ranging six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) was presented with an inverted L-shaped fracture of the left pectoral carapace. The fracture was stabilized with the use of three simple interrupted interfragmentary sutures of 2-0 nylon. After 7 days, wound dehiscence occurred, so sutures were replaced and the wound treated topically with castor bean oil cream. Healing of the fracture was observed after 14 days of this treatment.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25314850","annotations":[{"name":"Nylon","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon"},{"name":"Castor oil plant","weight":0.568203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_oil_plant"},{"name":"Bean","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.146078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Armadillo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo"},{"name":"Carapace","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carapace"},{"name":"Six-banded Armadillo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-banded_Armadillo"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Pectoral fin","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoral_fin"},{"name":"After 7","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_7"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"}]}
