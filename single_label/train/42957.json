{"id":42957,"title":"Left-sided primary tumors are associated with favorable prognosis in patients with KRAS codon 12/13 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy: an analysis of the AIO KRK-0104 trial.","abstract":"AIO KRK-0104 investigated first-line therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with cetuximab, capecitabine and irinotecan versus cetuximab, capecitabine and oxaliplatin. This analysis investigated the impact of primary tumor location on outcome of patients.Left-sided primary tumors were defined as tumors from rectum to left flexure, while tumors in the remaining colon were regarded right sided. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and response rate were correlated with primary tumor location. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate interaction between primary tumor location and KRAS mutation.Of 146 patients of the AIO KRK-0104 trial, 100 patients presented left-sided (of those 68 KRAS codon 12/13 wild-type) and 46 patients right-sided primary tumors (of those 27 KRAS codon 12/13 wild-type). Left-sided tumors were associated with significantly longer OS (p = 0.016, HR = 0.63) and PFS (p = 0.02, HR = 0.67) as compared to right-sided tumors. These effects were present in the KRAS codon 12/13 wild-type population (HR OS: 0.42; HR PFS: 0.54), while no impact of primary tumor location was evident in patients with KRAS codon 12/13 mutant tumors (HR OS: 1.3; HR PFS: 1.01). A significant interaction of KRAS status and primary tumor location concerning OS and PFS was observed.Our findings suggest that primary tumor location and KRAS codon 12/13 mutational status interact on the outcome of patients with mCRC receiving cetuximab-based first-line therapy. Left-sided primary tumor location might be a predictor of cetuximab efficacy.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816724","annotations":[{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Cetuximab","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetuximab"},{"name":"Irinotecan","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan"},{"name":"Capecitabine","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capecitabine"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.845925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.712304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.638079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.479258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.257219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1213","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1213"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Bending","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bending"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Uncial 0104","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0104"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
