{"id":10269,"title":"Piceatannol attenuates cardiac hypertrophy in an animal model through regulation of the expression and binding of the transcription factor GATA binding factor 6.","abstract":"Piceatannol is found in grapes, passion fruit, and Japanese knotweed. Piceatannol pretreatment suppresses cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol as assessed by heart weight/body weight ratio, cross-sectional area, and expression of hypertrophic markers. The anti-hypertrophic effect of piceatannol in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes is the same as that in vivo. Piceatannol inhibits lentiviral-GATA6-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Furthermore, piceatannol reduces the interaction between GATA4 and GATA6 as well as the DNA-binding activity of endogenous GATA6 in the ANP promoter. Our results suggest that piceatannol may be a novel therapeutic agent for the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662306","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.902825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.60925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Grape","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Japanese knotweed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_knotweed"},{"name":"Passiflora edulis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passiflora_edulis"},{"name":"Isoprenaline","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprenaline"},{"name":"Piceatannol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piceatannol"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Polygonum","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonum"},{"name":"Atrial natriuretic peptide","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
