{"id":44080,"title":"[Role of Sam68 in proliferation, invasion and migration of colorectal cancer cells in vitro].","abstract":"To investigate the role of Sam68 (Src-associated substrate during mitosis 68 kD) in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer.Colorectal cancer cell lines with stable Sam68 over-expressing and low Sam68 expression were established to test the effect of Sam68 in the proliferation, invasion, and migration of the cancer cells using colony formation, MTT and Transwell assays.SW480 and Ls174t colorectal cell lines over-expressing Sam68 showed significantly enhanced cell proliferation, invasion and migration (P<0.05). Conversely, the low Sam68 expression in SW620 and HCT116 colorectal cell lines significantly suppressed the cell proliferation, invasion and migration (P<0.05).The expression of Sam68 can promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of colorectal cancer cells lines in vitro.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752106","annotations":[{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.385295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.241117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.22791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0585202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Latvian lats","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_lats"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"}]}
