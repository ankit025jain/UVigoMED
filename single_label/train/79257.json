{"id":79257,"title":"Evaluation of a bedside test of utricular function - the bucket test - in older individuals.","abstract":"As a bedside test of subjective visual vertical (SVV), the 'bucket test' has a role as a viable and cost-effective clinical test of unilateral utricular dysfunction in older individuals.To investigate whether the bucket test as a test of the SVV is a valid bedside test of utricular function in older individuals.This was a diagnostic validation study at a tertiary academic medical center. Vestibular function was evaluated using sound-evoked cervical and tap-evoked ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP and oVEMP, respectively) asymmetry ratios, the bucket test of SVV, and the Dizziness Handicap Index (DHI), in 51 older individuals aged 70-95 years.Bucket test scores are correlated in both magnitude and direction with utricle-selective tap-evoked oVEMP asymmetry ratios, but not with sound-evoked cVEMP asymmetry ratios, which are saccule-selective, or with the DHI. Receiver operating characteristics analysis suggests that the bucket test is more specific than sensitive for utricular dysfunction, and a bucket test SVV score of 2Â° may maximize diagnostic yield relative to the currently accepted score of 3.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460151","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.294999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.16113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Vestibular","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Euclidean vector","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Schiedamse Voetbal Vereniging","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiedamse_Voetbal_Vereniging"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Professional wrestling match types","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Bucket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Handicap (golf)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_(golf)"},{"name":"Myogenic contraction","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myogenic_contraction"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"}]}
