{"id":23049,"title":"[Postcataract endophthalmitis caused by Enterococcus faecalis].","abstract":"Enterococcus faecalis is a major endophthalmitis-causing pathogen and often causes significant visual impairment. We investigated the clinical background, treatment and the visual outcome of patients with E. faecalis endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.We retrospectively conducted a postal survey directed mainly at the members of Japanese Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, and collected data on 30 eyes of 30 patients with E. faecalis endophthalmitis.The mean age of the patients was 73.5 years, and 10 cases had diabetes mellitus. The average time between cataract surgery and diagnosis of endophthalmitis was 4.8 days, and in 16 cases the disease developed 2 days after surgery. Final visual acuity was better than 40/200 in 13 eyes and 20/200 to no light perception in 15 eyes.E. faecalis caused acute-onset endophthalmitis. The visual outcome of the patients can be divided into good and poor groups.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505932","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.748311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.726851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.498092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.303381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.268517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Endophthalmitis","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endophthalmitis"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Enterococcus faecalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"United States Postal Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service"},{"name":"Major (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(United_States)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"}]}
