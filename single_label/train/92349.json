{"id":92349,"title":"Inhibition of ubiquitin proteasome system rescues the defective sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) protein causing Chianina cattle pseudomyotonia.","abstract":"A missense mutation in ATP2A1 gene, encoding sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA1) protein, causes Chianina cattle congenital pseudomyotonia, an exercise-induced impairment of muscle relaxation. Skeletal muscles of affected cattle are characterized by a selective reduction of SERCA1 in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. In this study, we provide evidence that the ubiquitin proteasome system is involved in the reduced density of mutated SERCA1. The treatment with MG132, an inhibitor of ubiquitin proteasome system, rescues the expression level and membrane localization of the SERCA1 mutant in a heterologous cellular model. Cells co-transfected with the Ca(2+)-sensitive probe aequorin show that the rescued SERCA1 mutant exhibits the same ability of wild type to maintain Ca(2+) homeostasis within cells. These data have been confirmed by those obtained ex vivo on adult skeletal muscle fibers from a biopsy from a pseudomyotonia-affected subject. Our data show that the mutation generates a protein most likely corrupted in proper folding but not in catalytic activity. Rescue of mutated SERCA1 to sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane can re-establish resting cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and prevent the appearance of pathological signs of cattle pseudomyotonia.
