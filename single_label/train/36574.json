{"id":36574,"title":"Two cases of arteriovenous fistula formation between the external iliac vessels following endovenous laser therapy.","abstract":"Minimally invasive treatment of varicose veins is becoming increasingly popular with both patients and physicians. Endovenous laser therapy has been shown to be safe and effective but the rare complication of iatrogenic creation of arteriovenous fistulas has been described. One case of fistulation between the external iliac artery and vein has been published. We report two further cases and describe their management.
