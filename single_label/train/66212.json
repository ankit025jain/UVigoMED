{"id":66212,"title":"Unenhanced respiratory-gated magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of renal artery in hypertensive patients using true fast imaging with steady-state precession technique compared with contrast-enhanced MRA.","abstract":"This study was aimed to evaluate the accuracy of \"True Fast Imaging with Steady-State Precession\" (TrueFISP) MR angiography (MRA) for diagnosis of renal arterial stenosis (RAS) in hypertensive patients.Twenty-two patients underwent both TrueFISP MRA and contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) on a 1.5-T MR imager. Volume of main renal arteries, length of maximal visible renal arteries, number of visualized branches, stenotic grade, and subjective quality were compared. Paired 2-tailed Student t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test were applied to evaluate the significance of these variables.Volume of main renal arteries, length of maximal visible renal arteries, and number of branches indicated no significant difference between the 2 techniques (P > 0.05). Stenotic degree of 10 RAS was greater on CE-MRA than on TrueFISP MRA. Qualitative scores from TrueFISP MRA were higher than those from CE-MRA (P < 0.05).TrueFISP MRA is a reliable and accurate method for evaluating RAS.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24733000","annotations":[{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.687438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance angiography","weight":0.63648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_angiography"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.61708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Precession","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.0895851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Electronic imager","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_imager"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"5T (gang)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5T_(gang)"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Russian Academy of Sciences","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"}]}
