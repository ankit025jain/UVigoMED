{"id":15337,"title":"Drug-resistant tuberculosis control in South Africa: scientific advances and health system strengthening are complementary.","abstract":"We examine some aspects of the South African health system that have contributed to the current multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M(X)DR-TB) epidemic and identify opportunities for change and improvement. Implementation of several recent major scientific advances have the potential to accelerate the control of M(X)DR-TB, but health systems strengthening will be essential.
