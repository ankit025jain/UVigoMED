{"id":85303,"title":"Study of leptin and adiponectin as disease markers in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea.","abstract":"Published studies showed conflicting results of the associations between adiponectin and leptin levels and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In obese patients, plasma leptin is elevated and adiponectin is decreased, and we postulate that these adipokines could be potential markers of clinical and metabolic perturbations in patients with OSA.147 patients with suspected OSA had polysomnography to determine the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI). We measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting serum insulin, plasma leptin, adiponectin, and full lipid profile. Patients were classified on the basis of the RDI, degree of adiposity, and insulin resistance (IR) (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR)).28.6% of subjects had normal polysomnography, 34.8% had mild OSA, 19.6% had moderate OSA, and 17% had severe OSA. Obesity was more prevalent in subjects with moderate-severe OSA (47%). Adiponectin decreased significantly (P = 0.041) with increasing severity of OSA. Though BMI was significantly higher in subjects with severe OSA, paradoxically, leptin was lowest in those subjects independent of gender dimorphism.Adiponectin is an independent marker of disease severity in patients with OSA. The paradoxical decrease in circulating leptin, which suggests impaired secretion, deserves further studies as a potential marker of severe OSA.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982545","annotations":[{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Adiponectin","weight":0.872173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.86732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.849146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.82423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.758741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.676988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Adipokine","weight":0.58122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.425758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.248919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Reference Daily Intake","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Respiratory Disturbance Index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_Disturbance_Index"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Axiom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
