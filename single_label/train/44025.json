{"id":44025,"title":"Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation-assisted laparoscopic hepatectomy.","abstract":"Metachronous rectal liver metastasis (15?mm in segment 8 ventral) was managed with laparoscopic hepatectomy using segmental blood flow occlusion with radiofrequency ablation. During liver dissection, the ischemic area was visible as a distinct hypoechoic area on intraoperative enhanced ultrasound; with a photodynamic eye camera, it appeared as a discolored lesion. The resection was completed with adequate margins.
