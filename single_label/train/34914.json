{"id":34914,"title":"[Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in an adolescent girl].","abstract":"We report the case of a 14-year-old girl who presented with symptoms of left ventricular systolic failure following the rupture of a cerebellar arteriovenous malformation. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy needs to be recognized by pediatricians because the triggering factors, such as physical or emotional stress, are common during childhood. Echocardiography showed a typical dyskinesia of the left ventricular apical or midventricular segments with a hyperkinetic basal region. Symptomatic treatment may be necessary in cases of hypotension, arrhythmias, or acute heart failure. As the prognosis is generally good, reassuring information can be given and cardiologic investigations limited.
