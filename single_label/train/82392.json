{"id":82392,"title":"Studies on the possible aetiological role of different Candida species in pathogenesis of dentine caries by monitoring the calcium release from tooth particles.","abstract":"An in vitro model has been developed for study of cariogenic potential of different Candida species. Slices were prepared from the root of extracted healthy teeth. These disks were covered with inert material, only the central hole, i.e. the root canal dentin surface remained uncovered. These preparates with free root dentin surfaces were incubated in Sabouraud medium in the presence of six-six Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida inconspicua and Candida norvegensis strains. The calcium release was detected for 15 days. Two types of release could be distinguished. C. albicans deliberated calcium more aggressively (type \"A\" curve), while other Candidas were characterized by less expressed calcium releasing capacity (type \"B\" curve). Curves type \"A\" and \"B\" were divided into four steps in order to characterize more precisely the different dynamics of calcium release. Analyses of the different steps also suggested the more aggressive behaviour of C. albicans. Our results indicate that in addition to cariogenic role of different bacteria, fungi may also actively take part in the dentinal caries progress.
