{"id":25937,"title":"[Current status of the management of venous thromboembolism in Japan].","abstract":"In the past, unfractionated heparin and warfarin have been used as anticoagulants for treatment of venous thromboembolism in Japan. Although it has been effective anticoagulants, these uses are accompanied by several pitfalls, which have led to research and the discovery of new additional groups of anticoagulants: parenteral factor Xa inhibitors, such as fondaparinux, and oral direct factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. These new anticoagulants are fast-acting, noninferior to heparin and warfarin in preventing recurrence of venous thromboembolism, and do not require monitoring. These new anticoagulants show promise for improvement of long-term outcome for venous thromboembolism.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163325","annotations":[{"name":"Warfarin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin"},{"name":"Fondaparinux","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondaparinux"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Factor X","weight":0.814059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_X"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.7968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Rivaroxaban","weight":0.592932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivaroxaban"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.517297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Apixaban","weight":0.319444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apixaban"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Direct Xa inhibitor","weight":0.082094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Xa_inhibitor"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
