{"id":5857,"title":"[Study on baking processing technology of hui medicine Aconitum flavum].","abstract":"To screen and optimize the processing technology of Aconitum flavum.The acute-toxicity, anti-inflammatory and analgesic experiments were used as indexes. Four processing methods, including decoction, streaming, baking and processing with Chebulae Fructus decoction, were compared to screen the optimum processing method for Aconitum flavum. The baking time was also optimized.The optimal baked technology was that 1-2 mm decoction pieces was baked at 105 degrees C for 3 hours.The baking method is proved to be the optimal processing method of Aconitum flavum. It is shown that this method is simple and stable.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090673","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.469809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.203312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Aconitum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aconitum"},{"name":"Decoction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoction"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Baking","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking"},{"name":"C (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Streaming media","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media"},{"name":"1 millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_millimetre"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Stability theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Semiotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"}]}
