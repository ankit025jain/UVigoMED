{"id":35946,"title":"A case of harlequin ichthyosis treated with isotretinoin.","abstract":"Harlequin ichthyosis is a rare congenital ichthyosis classified under the category of Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyoses, which also include lamellar ichthyosis and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. It is caused by functional null mutations in the ABCA12 gene, a keratinocyte lipid transporter associated with lamellar granule formation. Patients have a classic clinical presentation at delivery and need neonatal intensive care treatment to maximize their chances of survival. Early oral retinoid therapy has been shown to increase survival in patients with harlequin ichthyosis, and we present a case of a 9-month-old male with this condition who has been treated with isotretinoin since day 7 of life.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612573","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.844109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Harlequin-type ichthyosis","weight":0.746993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin-type_ichthyosis"},{"name":"Keratinocyte","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"},{"name":"Retinoid","weight":0.722519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoid"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Ichthyosis","weight":0.52408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosis"},{"name":"Lamellar ichthyosis","weight":0.411784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamellar_ichthyosis"},{"name":"Isotretinoin","weight":0.357341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotretinoin"},{"name":"Erythroderma","weight":0.274443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythroderma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.11264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Harlequin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"ABCA12","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCA12"},{"name":"Total chances","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_chances"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"American Baseball Coaches Association","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Baseball_Coaches_Association"},{"name":"Lamella (materials)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamella_(materials)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
