{"id":87705,"title":"Iliopubic subcutaneous plate osteosynthesis for osteoporotic fractures of the anterior pelvic ring. An alternative to the supra-acetabular external fixator.","abstract":"The majority of fractures of the anterior pelvic ring is treated non-operatively. However, a number of patients do not get pain free and cannot be mobilized. Since the supra-acetabular external fixator is associated with significant complications we developed an alternative technique based on recent anatomical studies. This article is a clinical feasibility study to evaluate a novel stabilization technique for fractures of the anterior pelvic ring in the elderly patient. This technique obtains rapid pain reduction and early ambulation in this group of patients.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011200","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.630312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.475957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.243561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.208226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0720117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Feasibility study","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study"}]}
