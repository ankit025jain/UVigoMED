{"id":10565,"title":"Omega-3 fatty acids protect renal functions by increasing docosahexaenoic acid-derived metabolite levels in SHR.Cg-Lepr(cp)/NDmcr rats, a metabolic syndrome model.","abstract":"The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (?-3 PUFAs) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and/or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) protect against diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting inflammation. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of highly purified DHA and EPA or EPA only administration on renal function and renal eicosanoid and docosanoid levels in an animal model of metabolic syndrome, SHR.Cg-Lepr(cp)/NDmcr (SHRcp) rats. Male SHRcp rats were divided into 3 groups. Control (5% arabic gum), TAK-085 (300 mg/kg/day, containing 467 mg/g EPA and 365 mg/g DHA), or EPA (300 mg/kg/day) was orally administered for 20 weeks. The urinary albumin to creatinine ratio in the TAK-085-administered group was significantly lower than that in other groups. The glomerular sclerosis score in the TAK-085-administered group was significantly lower than that in the other groups. Although DHA levels were increased in total kidney fatty acids, the levels of nonesterified DHA were not significantly different among the 3 groups, whereas the levels of protectin D1, resolvin D1, and resolvin D2 were significantly increased in the TAK-085-administered group. The results show that the use of combination therapy with DHA and EPA in SHRcp rats improved or prevented renal failure associate with metabolic syndrome with decreasing triglyceride levels and increasing ?-3 PUFA lipid mediators.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642910","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Eicosapentaenoic acid","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Diabetic nephropathy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_nephropathy"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Eicosanoid","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoid"},{"name":"Docosahexaenoic acid","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fat","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.702209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fatty acid","weight":0.651187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.577085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.506857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.340539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.314279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.29832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"United States Environmental Protection Agency","weight":0.252138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Lipid signaling","weight":0.200187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_signaling"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.111585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor D2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D2"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"}]}
