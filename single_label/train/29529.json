{"id":29529,"title":"Self-control and implicit drinking identity as predictors of alcohol consumption, problems, and cravings.","abstract":"We investigated trait and alcohol-specific self-control as unique predictors and moderators of the relation between implicit drinking identity associations and drinking.Three hundred undergraduates completed a drinking identity Implicit Association Test (IAT), trait and alcohol self-control questionnaires, and alcohol consumption, problems, and cravings inventories.Regression analyses tested for unique effects of predictors and for Self-Control × IAT interactions. Each predictor accounted for unique variance in consumption, but there was no evidence of moderation effects. Both types of self-control, but not IAT scores, accounted for unique variance in problems. A Trait Self-Control × Implicit Drinking interaction accounted for excess zeros in problems, with a greater likelihood of not having alcohol problems among individuals with low implicit identity who had higher versus lower trait self-control. Each predictor accounted for unique variance in cravings. A Trait Self-Control × IAT interaction was also found, indicating that implicit drinking identity was a stronger predictor of cravings among those with lower versus higher trait self-control.Results are partially consistent with previous research: Both types of self-control and drinking identity associations predicted unique variance in drinking, and moderation effects were observed for trait self-control and drinking identity associations and two of the three drinking variables. Findings suggest that trait and alcohol-specific self-control and implicit drinking identity could be useful intervention targets.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650823","annotations":[{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.142583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Implicit Association Test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_Association_Test"},{"name":"Undergraduate education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Internet forum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"},{"name":"Moderation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Trait theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"},{"name":"Implicit memory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory"}]}
