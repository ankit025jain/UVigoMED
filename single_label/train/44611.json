{"id":44611,"title":"Detailed analysis of prognostic factors in primary esophageal small cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus (SCCE) is characterized as highly aggressive with a poor prognosis. To identify potential prognostic factors and to assess the role of surgical procedures, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy for SCCE, we retrospectively analyzed patients with SCCE from three large institutions in China.All of the SCCE patients between 1998 and 2012 were identified from three clinical databases of the Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Peking Union Cancer Hospital and Shantou Cancer Hospital. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed with univariate analysis and a Cox regression model. Subgroup analysis based on the 2002 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for esophageal cancer was applied to examine the effect of treatment on survival.In patients with stage I/II SCCE, 85% underwent operations and showed improved survival (median survival time [MST] 29 vs 17.4 months, p = 0.082). However, chemotherapy did not further improve survival. In patients with stage IIB/III SCCE, chemotherapy, instead of operation, improved survival (MST 13.0 vs 6.1 months, p = 0.003), and radiotherapy resulted in improved survival. In stage IV patients, chemotherapy improved survival (MST 12.5 vs 4.0 months, p < 0.001), and chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone (MST 13.2 vs 8.9 months, p = 0.014).Surgical procedures alone can be recommended for stage I/IIA patients. In patients with stage IIB disease or above, chemotherapy should be the main treatment approach, and chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy tended to improve survival.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726599","annotations":[{"name":"Small-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.737917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.679005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"American Joint Committee on Cancer","weight":0.554984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Joint_Committee_on_Cancer"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.550574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.53219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.344527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.282766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"List of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
