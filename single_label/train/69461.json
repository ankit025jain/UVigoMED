{"id":69461,"title":"Cost-effectiveness comparison of renal calculi treated with ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy versus shockwave lithotripsy.","abstract":"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) vs ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URS) for patients with renal stones <1.5 cm in diameter.Patient age, stone diameter, stone location, and stone-free status were recorded for patients treated with SWL or URS for renal stones <1.5 cm in maximal diameter over a 1-year period. Institutional charges were obtained from in-house billing. A decision analysis model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of SWL and URS and using our results and success rates for modeling. Three separate models were created to reflect practice patterns for SWL.One hundred fifty-eight patients were included in the study-78 underwent SWL and 80 underwent URS as primary treatment. Single procedure stone-free rates (SFR) for SWL and URS were 55% and 95%, respectively (P<0.0001). Decision analysis modeling demonstrated cost-effectiveness of SWL when SWL single procedure SFR were 65% to 67% or when URS single procedure SFR was 72% to 84%.This retrospective study revealed superior SFR results for renal stones <1.5 cm for URS compared with SWL. Our decision analysis model demonstrates that for SWL SFR less than 65% to 67% or for URS SFR greater than 72% to 84%, SWL is not a cost-effective treatment option. Based on these findings, careful stratification and selection of stone patients may enable surgeons to increase the cost-effectiveness of SWL.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444144","annotations":[{"name":"Laser","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.304401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.282231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.233456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Shock wave","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lithotripsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotripsy"},{"name":"Decision analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis"},{"name":"Laser lithotripsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_lithotripsy"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Ureteroscopy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureteroscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Soviet Union","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Billing (filmmaking)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billing_(filmmaking)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"SFR","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFR"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Tasmanian Football League","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Football_League"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
