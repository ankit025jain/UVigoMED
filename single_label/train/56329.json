{"id":56329,"title":"[Cataracts related to the extended application of dermocorticosteroids. A study of 8 cases in Abidjan].","abstract":"Cataract induced by corticosteroids is an entity, which has been well described for a relatively long time, but this eventuality caused by the cutaneous application of corticosteroids remains inadequately reported. The purpose of this study was to describe cataract as one of the complications of the misuse of cutaneous application of corticosteroids.In eight patients seen for visual loss, bilateral cataract was discovered. The only probable etiology in these cases appeared to be the cutaneous application of corticosteroids. Indeed, the work-up and careful history performed did not uncover any other etiology.Eight patients, six women and two men, exhibited cataracts related to the application of topical corticosteroids. The age of the patients ranged between 39 and 45 years. The cataracts were bilateral and posterior subcapsular alone or combined. The period of use of corticosteroids ranged from 5 to 10 years. The products used consisted of a variety of chemicals including corticosteroids mainly in the form of traditionally manufactured soap, but also as ointment or other types of mixtures.Topical corticosteroids induce posterior subcapsular cataract. The mechanism of action is direct access to the eye without any hepatic-first pass effect on the corticosteroid in question. The increasingly frequent use of corticosteroids in African blacks for skin lightening raises concern regarding the risk of epidemic cataracts in young women attempting to lighten their skin to be beautiful. Increased public awareness should be undertaken to prevent this growing and harmful phenomenon.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703192","annotations":[{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.910198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.789055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.787868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.583877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.556261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.520423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.211533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.193782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Soap","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Abidjan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abidjan"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0297571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Skin whitening","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_whitening"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.0130527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"}]}
