{"id":18731,"title":"Successful surgical outcome of infected aneurysmal drug-coated stent endocarditis.","abstract":"A 52-year-old man developed pyrexia after primary angioplasty following anterior myocardial infarction Noninvasive evaluation revealed staphylococcal septicemia with suspicion of an aneurysm or abscess at the stented segment. Coronary angiography confirmed the presence of a large aneurysm. The infected left anterior descending artery aneurysm was de-roofed and ligated, and a saphenous vein bypass graft was placed, with an excellent outcome.
