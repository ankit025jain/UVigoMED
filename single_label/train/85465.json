{"id":85465,"title":"Outcome of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients after acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","abstract":"Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an evidence-based intervention in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which improves the exercise capacity and quality of life (QoL).We studied 60 patients after an episode of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). They were randomised to receive conventional treatment without pulmonary rehabilitation (CTWPR) (n=30) or, standard treatment plus a 12-week post-exacerbation pulmonary rehabilitation (PEPR) programme in addition. Assessment of exercise capacity by six minute walk test (6MWT) and QoL measured by St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were carried out initially and at the end of three months.The baseline characteristics of both the groups were found to be similar. There was a statistically significant increase in the six minute walk distance (6MWD) (increase by 37.9 meters, p< 0.001) and a significant decline in the total SGRQ score (by 3.8 units p< 0.001) in the PEPR group compared to CTWPR group.Early pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with an AECOPD has significant benefits on the QoL and exercise capacity.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930201","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.762749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.723856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.687788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.672338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.585027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.485106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.381649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.37651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.2699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_exacerbation_of_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"St Georges A.F.C.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Georges_A.F.C."},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Measurement while drilling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_while_drilling"}]}
