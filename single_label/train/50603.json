{"id":50603,"title":"Changes in coffee intake and subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes: three large cohorts of US men and women.","abstract":"Coffee and tea consumption has been associated with a lower type 2 diabetes risk but little is known about how changes in coffee and tea consumption influence subsequent type 2 diabetes risk. We examined the associations between 4 year changes in coffee and tea consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes in the subsequent 4 years.We prospectively followed 48,464 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1986-2006), 47,510 women in NHS II (1991-2007) and 27,759 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; 1986-2006). Diet was assessed every 4 years using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Self-reported cases of incident type 2 diabetes were validated by supplementary questionnaires.During 1,663,319 person-years of follow-up, we documented 7,269 cases of incident type 2 diabetes. Participants who increased their coffee consumption by more than 1 cup/day (median change?=?1.69 cups/day) over a 4 year period had an 11% (95% CI 3%, 18%) lower risk of type 2 diabetes in the subsequent 4 years compared with those who made no changes in consumption. Participants who decreased their coffee intake by more than 1 cup/day (median change?=?-2 cups/day) had a 17% (95% CI 8%, 26%) higher risk for type 2 diabetes. Changes in tea consumption were not associated with type 2 diabetes risk.Our data provide novel evidence that increasing coffee consumption over a 4 year period is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, while decreasing coffee consumption is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in subsequent years.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771089","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.62712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.327003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tea","weight":0.240727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.186252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.172547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Coffee","weight":0.157641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.147467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0580456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.0344035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"High Performance File System","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_File_System"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"759","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/759"},{"name":"663","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/663"},{"name":"319","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/319"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Supplementary angles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_angles"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Word of Wisdom","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_Wisdom"}]}
