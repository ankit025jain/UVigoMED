Patients were examined clinically and instrumental before revision osteosynthesis, in short-term and long-term period after the operation. Authors systemized revealed mistakes into 4 groups and found out that the most frequent were tactical and technical (84.7%) mistakes, much less--diagnostic and organizational. Developed algorithm of preoperative evaluation, planning, technology, revision reconstructive operations allowed shortening recover time of anatomy and function to the average in 92.6% of patients.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734431","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.564343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.422042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.370684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.340416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Military tactics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_tactics"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Mistakes (Brian McFadden song)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistakes_(Brian_McFadden_song)"}]}
