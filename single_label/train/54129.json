{"id":54129,"title":"Occurrence of complications in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients: a hospital based study.","abstract":"Type 2 diabetes is characterised by a long asymptomatic period of hyperglycaemia and many individuals with type 2 diabetes have complications even at the time of diagnosis. The purpose of present study was to study and compare the prevalence of complications at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in newly diagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. One hundred and five consecutive newly diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes were selected for study based on fasting blood glucose level > or = 126 mg/dl. Individuals who were known diabetic, individuals presenting with acute complications were excluded from study. The prevalence rates of various complications in newly diagnosed diabetic patients were studied in both asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects and results were analysed statistically using test of proportion and Chi-square test. There were 40.95% of newly diagnosed diabetes patients who were asymptomatic. There was no significant difference between those having symptoms of diabetes and those without symptoms of diabetes with regard to age, sex, weight and hypertension. Occurrence of both microvascular and macrovascular complications were not different in the two groups studied. We also observed a very high prevalence of microvascular (32.55%) complications in asymptomatic newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. Since 35.20% of cases in this study were below 50 years and various complications develop 10-20 years after onset of disease, this study suggests that screening for diabetes should commence at the age of 40 years in general population.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475555","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.33322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"}]}
