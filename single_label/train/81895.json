{"id":81895,"title":"How do parents look after children's teeth? A qualitative study of attitudes to oral health in the early years.","abstract":"This study aimed to examine how parents and carers of pre-school children care for their children's teeth. Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with mothers of pre-school children at a children's centre in Bristol. The interviewees were aged between 29 and 37 years, and the number of children in the families ranged from one to four, with their age range spanning four weeks to 11 years. Using a grounded theory approach, transcribed interviews were coded and analysed until several themes emerged from the data. The study identified an overarching theme of parents' belief that oral health care for their children was common sense, which was a key factor influencing advice seeking from professionals. Sub-themes were the difficulties in establishing home oral healthcare routines and a lack of knowledge of when to register their child with a dentist. Advice was often given inconsistently and parents experienced difficulties accessing services, with many not seeking advice and information pro-actively. The study concluded that some parents are missing out on important early information, advice and care around oral health for their young children.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791456","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.67526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.636741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.629513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.482717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Belief","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.458923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.139371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.113719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Bristol","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Common sense","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Grounded theory","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Theme music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_music"},{"name":"Twelve Apostles","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Apostles"},{"name":"Concept album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
