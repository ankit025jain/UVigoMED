{"id":52246,"title":"Computed tomography and magnetic resonance images of adrenocortical oncocytoma cases.","abstract":"We present two cases of adrenocortical oncocytomas that were well-delineated on multi-detector computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The images showed a well-enhanced large mass with multiple stippled calcifications in a 10-yr-old girl who was consulted due to precocious puberty. A well-enhanced solid mass with necrotic components was incidentally noticed in a 54-yr-old man. These lesions were resected and diagnosed as adrenocortical oncocytomas through immunohistochemical studies and electron microscopy. Adrenocortical oncocytomas are rare disease entities, therefore, we report these interesting, rare adrenocortical oncocytomas here with radiologic findings, and discuss differential diagnosis.
