{"id":81934,"title":"The value of elective parotidectomy in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin of the head.","abstract":"Parotid metastases from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) are associated with poor prognosis. However, the incidence of occult parotid lymph node metastases in high-risk CSCC is unclear. Therefore, the role of elective parotidectomy is still controversial. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the value of elective parotidectomy in patients with high-risk CSCC.The clinical data including histological and radiological results, as well as surgery-related complications, of 13 patients with high-risk CSCC who underwent elective parotidectomy were retrospectively analyzed.Occult parotid lymph node metastases were detected by histological examination in only 1 out of 13 patients after elective parotidectomy. Surgery-related complications and morbidity were not observed.In the absence of clinical disease in the parotid gland, the risk of occult metastases is not high enough to warrant for elective parotidectomy in patients with CSCC.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778056","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.597221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.176249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
