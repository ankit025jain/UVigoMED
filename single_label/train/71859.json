{"id":71859,"title":"A highly-sensitive anti-Müllerian hormone assay improves analysis of ovarian function following chemotherapy for early breast cancer.","abstract":"Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) shows promise as a biomarker of the ovarian reserve but current assays are insufficiently sensitive to allow assessment of this post-chemotherapy in most women. We have assessed a new highly sensitive AMH assay (Ansh picoAMH) in the evaluation of ovarian activity in women with very low ovarian reserve after chemotherapy.A prospective cohort and an independent validation cohort of premenopausal women with early breast cancer (eBC) were recruited at the time of diagnosis (combined n=98), and ovarian reserve markers 2-5 years later following chemotherapy were assessed in relation to menstrual activity.The picoAMH assay had a limit of detection of 7.5 pg/ml. AMH clearly distinguished women with ongoing menses from those with amenorrhoea at 2 years after diagnosis (mean 522 ± 169 versus 8.9 ± 1.3 pg/ml, P<0.0001) with high predictive value for continuing menses or amenorrhoea for the subsequent 3 years. AMH was detectable in more women than using a previous assay (P=0.004). Other markers of the ovarian reserve (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B) were also of discriminatory value but to lesser extents. This finding was validated in a second, independent cohort of women treated for eBC.The 10-fold increased assay sensitivity showed very clear distinction between groups based on ovarian activity with excellent prediction of future menses or amenorrhoea. This will improve assessment of post-chemotherapy ovarian function in women and may aid treatment decisions.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25027307","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.916564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Amenorrhoea","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenorrhoea"},{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.848602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.692491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Activin and inhibin","weight":0.26317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activin_and_inhibin"},{"name":"Ovarian reserve","weight":0.166355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_reserve"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"125 BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/125_BC"},{"name":"Extent (file systems)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extent_(file_systems)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Antimullerian hormone","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimullerian_hormone"},{"name":"Premenopausal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenopausal"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
