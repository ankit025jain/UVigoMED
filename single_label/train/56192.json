{"id":56192,"title":"Anterior segment invasion in retinoblastoma: is it a risk factor for extraocular relapse?","abstract":"We report a retrospective review of patients with retinoblastoma and anterior segment invasion (ASI) as risk factors for extraocular relapse. Only those with ASI combined with postlaminar optic nerve invasion and/or scleral invasion received adjuvant chemotherapy and those with tumor at the resection margin received orbital radiotherapy. Those with only uveal invasion did not receive adjuvant therapy. Of 479 evaluable patients, 67 patients had pathologically confirmed ASI, including 52 with anterior chamber invasion and 47 with iris or ciliary body invasion. ASI occurred with other pathology risk factors (25 had concomitant posterior uveal invasion, 36 had postlaminar optic nerve invasion, 11 with cut-end invasion, and 25 with scleral invasion). The 5-year disease-free survival (pDFS) was 0.9 (95% CI, 0.8-0.95) for children with ASI with no significant differences among children with other pathology risk factors with and without ASI. ASI was not significantly associated with extraocular relapse in multivariate analysis. There were no significant differences in pDFS for patients with anterior chamber invasion and those with iris-ciliary body invasion (pDFS 0.89 [95% CI, 0.65-0.96] vs. 0.93 [95% CI, 0.61-0.98]). To conclude, ASI was seen with other pathology risk factors and it did not add a significant risk for extraocular relapse.
