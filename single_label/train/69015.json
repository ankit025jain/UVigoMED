{"id":69015,"title":"Prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in elderly adults with chronic kidney disease: results from the survey of Prevalence, Awareness, and Treatment Rates in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients with Hypertension in China.","abstract":"Data regarding hypertension in elderly adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains limited. This study aimed to assess the epidemiological characteristics of hypertension in elderly adults with CKD using data from a nationwide survey.A nationwide, multicenter, cross-sectional study with a large sample.The Survey of Prevalence, Awareness, and Treatment Rates in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients with Hypertension in China (PATRIOTIC).Participants in PATRIOTIC (aged?60; n=2,414).Trained physicians measured blood pressure (BP) using a standard protocol with a mercury sphygmomanometer at the time of admission.The prevalence, awareness, and treatment of hypertension in elderly adults with CKD were 82.0%, 90.7%, and 87.3%, respectively. The control of hypertension at BP less than 140/90 mmHg was 29.6% and at BP less than 130/80 mmHg it was 12.1%. No significant differences were noted in the prevalence, awareness, treatment, or control of hypertension in individuals with CKD divided into the age groups of 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 and older (P>.05). With increasing age, the proportion of isolated systolic hypertension in elderly adults with CKD with uncontrolled hypertension increased (P=.02). Obesity (P=.01), CKD Stages 4 and 5 (P<.001), and concomitant diabetes mellitus (P=.002) were significantly associated with uncontrolled hypertension in elderly adults with CKD, using the goal of BP less than 140/90 mmHg.The prevalence of hypertension in elderly adults in China with CKD is high, and its control is poor. Most elderly adults with CKD with uncontrolled hypertension have systolic hypertension. Obesity, CKD Stages 4 and 5, and diabetes mellitus were adversely associated with greater uncontrolled hypertension in elderly adults with CKD.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479145","annotations":[{"name":"Sphygmomanometer","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphygmomanometer"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Nephrology","weight":0.798635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.741293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.727774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.608088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"China","weight":0.47816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Systolic hypertension","weight":0.339002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_hypertension"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.238135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
