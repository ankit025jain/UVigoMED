{"id":88537,"title":"X-cephalometric study of different parts of the upper airway space and changes in hyoid position following mandibular fractures.","abstract":"This study analyses the different parts of the upper airway space and the changes in hyoid position. The results provide a clinical reference for developing timely and effective treatment programmes for patients with mandibular fractures caused by maxillofacial trauma.Standard X-cephalometric measurements of the lateral skull of 210 subjects were taken. The subjects were divided into four fracture groups: condylar, mandibular angle, mandibular body, and parasymphyseal.The radiographs of the mandibular fracture groups were compared with the normal occlusion group to analyse the upper airway space and the changes in hyoid position. Different types of fractures have different effects on the upper airway space. Bilateral mandibular body fracture and the parasymphyseal fracture have a significant influence on the lower oropharyngeal and laryngopharyngeal airway spaces, with serious obstructions severely restricting the ventilatory function of patients.Fractures at different parts of the mandibular structure are closely related to the upper airway and hyoid position.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831904","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.633837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.441381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Hyoid bone","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid_bone"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Condyloid process","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyloid_process"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
