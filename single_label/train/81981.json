{"id":81981,"title":"A three dimensional study of upper airway in adult skeletal Class II patients with different vertical growth patterns.","abstract":"The study was performed to compare the 3D pharyngeal airway dimensions in adult skeletal Class II patients with different vertical growth patterns (low, normal, and high angle) and to investigate whether the upper airway dimensions of untreated skeletal Class II adults were affected by vertical skeletal variables.Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) records of 64 untreated adult skeletal Class II patients (34 male and 30 female) were collected to evaluate the pharyngeal airway dimensions. Subjects were divided into three subgroups according to the GoGn-SN angle (low angle, normal angle or high angle). All subgroups were matched for sex. ANOVA and SNK-q tests were used to identify differences within and among groups (p<0.05). Coefficient of product-moment correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient) was used to analyze the association between pharyngeal airway dimensions and vertical growth patterns.The results showed that pharyngeal airway measurements were statistically significantly less (p<0.05) in high angle group as compared to normal angle or low angle group.Adult skeletal Class II subjects with vertical growth patterns have significantly narrower pharyngeal airways than those with normal or horizontal growth patterns, confirming an association between pharyngeal airway measurements and a vertical skeletal pattern.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755893","annotations":[{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.905122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.629183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.510719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.47558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.413345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"CBCT (TV)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBCT_(TV)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Airway (aviation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_(aviation)"},{"name":"Low-angle shot","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-angle_shot"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Indirect fire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_fire"},{"name":"Classes of United States Senators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators"}]}
