{"id":43727,"title":"Manifestation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) in hepatic ductal structures and renal tubules of female rats with experimental cholestasis of pregnancy.","abstract":"Studies by the immunohistochemical method with semiquantitative analysis of images showed that hyperprolactinemia stimulated CFTR protein manifestation in the bile ducts of female rats, which was clearly expressed in experimental cholestasis of pregnancy. The expression of CFTR in the renal tubules was reduced in hyperprolactinemia under conditions of normal liver function and in cholestasis of pregnancy. Significant positive correlations between CFTR, prolactin receptor, and multiple drug resistance protein 3 were detected in the bile ducts, but not in the renal tubules. Presumably, prolactin has a direct effect on CFTR expression in the bile ducts and indirect effect in the renal tubules. Changes in CFTR protein manifestation in the hepatic ductal structures and renal tubules in experimental pregnancy cholestasis could aggravate the disease.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770751","annotations":[{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Hyperprolactinaemia","weight":0.88562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperprolactinaemia"},{"name":"Cholestasis","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestasis"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.691293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","weight":0.575874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator"},{"name":"Transmembrane protein","weight":0.553095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmembrane_protein"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0548654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"}]}
