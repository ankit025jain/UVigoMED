{"id":67923,"title":"High calcium concentration in bones promotes bone metastasis in renal cell carcinomas expressing calcium-sensing receptor.","abstract":"The prognosis for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is related to a high rate of metastasis, including 30% of bone metastasis. Characteristic for bone tissue is a high concentration of calcium ions. In this study, we show a promoting effect of an enhanced extracellular calcium concentration on mechanisms of bone metastasis via the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and its downstream signaling molecules.Our analyses were performed using 33 (11/category) matched specimens of normal and tumor tissue and 9 (3/category) primary cells derived from RCC patients of the 3 categories: non-metastasized, metastasized into the lung and metastasized into bones during a five-year period after nephrectomy. Expression of CaSR was determined by RT-PCR, Western blot analyses and flow cytometry, respectively. Cells were treated by calcium and the CaSR inhibitor NPS 2143. Cell migration was measured in a Boyden chamber with calcium (10 ?M) as chemotaxin and proliferation by BrdU incorporation. The activity of intracellular signaling mediators was quantified by a phospho-kinase array and Western blot.The expression of CaSR was highest in specimens and cells of patients with bone metastases. Calcium treatment induced an increased migration (19-fold) and proliferation (2.3-fold) exclusively in RCC cells from patients with bone metastases. The CaSR inhibitor NPS 2143 elucidated the role of CaSR on the calcium-dependent effects. After treatment with calcium, the activity of AKT, PLC?-1, p38? and JNK was clearly enhanced and PTEN expression was almost completely abolished in bone metastasizing RCC cells.Our results indicate a promoting effect of extracellular calcium on cell migration and proliferation of bone metastasizing RCC cells via highly expressed CaSR and its downstream signaling pathways. Consequently, CaSR may be regarded as a new prognostic marker predicting RCC bone metastasis.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576174","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.910283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.852481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.848185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.840946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.751115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.690562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.642604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"C-Jun N-terminal kinases","weight":0.62153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases"},{"name":"Lipid signaling","weight":0.41286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_signaling"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.406747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.374911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.370048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Phospholipase C","weight":0.117418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_C"},{"name":"Osseous tissue","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseous_tissue"},{"name":"Bromodeoxyuridine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromodeoxyuridine"},{"name":"Calcium-sensing receptor","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium-sensing_receptor"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.0126805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"}]}
