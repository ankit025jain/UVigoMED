{"id":82034,"title":"Functional analysis and treatment of the diurnal bruxism of a 16-year-old girl with autism.","abstract":"Bruxism is defined as the clenching and grinding of teeth. This study used a functional analysis to examine whether the bruxism of a 16-year-old girl with autism was maintained by automatic reinforcement or social consequences. A subsequent component analysis of the intervention package described by Barnoy, Najdowski, Tarbox, Wilke, and Nollet (2009) showed that a vocal reprimand (e.g., \"stop grinding\") effectively reduced the participant's bruxism. Results were maintained across time, and effects extended to novel staff members.
