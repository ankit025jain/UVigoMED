{"id":63660,"title":"Early molecular response in chronic myeloid leukemia patients predicts future response status.","abstract":"Imatinib is the frontline therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) management. Most of the CML patients achieve major responses, but a proportion (nearly 25-35%) of them develop drug resistance. Molecular monitoring using quantitative real-time PCR at regular intervals according to European LeukemiaNet (ELN) helps in the assessment of long-term outcomes in imatinib-treated CML patients. Eighty-four CML patient samples (42 at diagnosis and 42 at 3-month intervals from the same patients) were analyzed for Bcr-Abl transcript levels. Quantification results revealed that the patients with <10% Bcr-Abl levels at 3 months had higher rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and optimal responses compared to patients with >10% Bcr-Abl levels (P?<?0.0001). Patients with >10% Bcr-Abl levels were found to have 25.0% of suboptimal response and 3.57% of failure to imatinib at standard dose. Hence, the present study confirms that early molecular monitoring at 3 months after imatinib initiation helps in predicting the concurrent cytogenetic response and treatment optimization in CML patients.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24414484","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.715152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.543772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.328301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"National Liberation Army (Colombia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Army_(Colombia)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"}]}
