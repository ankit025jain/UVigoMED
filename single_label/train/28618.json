{"id":28618,"title":"Determination of toxins involved in ciguatera fish poisoning in the Pacific by LC/MS.","abstract":"Ciguatera fish poisoning is the most extensive and difficult to control of the seafood poisonings. To facilitate monitoring of fish toxicity, toxin profiles were investigated by an LC/MS/MS method using 14 reference toxins on eight representative species of fish collected in four different areas of the Pacific. Snappers and groupers from Okinawa contained ciguatoxin-1B (CTX1B) and two deoxy congeners at variable but species-specific ratios, while red snapper, Lutjanus bohar, from Minamitorishima, and amberjack, Seriola dumerili, from Hawaii, contained both CTX1B-type and CTX3C-type toxins. Spotted knifejaw, Oplegnathus punctatus, from Okinawan waters, contained mainly CTX4A and CTX4B, but the same species caught at Miyazaki was contaminated primarily with the CTX3C-type toxins. Otherwise, the toxin profiles were consistently species-specific in fish collected from various locations around Okinawa over 20 years. The LC/MS/MS and mouse bioassay results agreed well, indicating the LC/MS/MS method is a promising alternative to the mouse bioassay. Pure CTX1B and CTX3C were prepared for use in future LC/MS/MS analysis.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830151","annotations":[{"name":"Ciguatera","weight":0.841285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciguatera"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Pacific Ocean","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"},{"name":"Hawaii","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.659617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Lutjanidae","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutjanidae"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.498496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Red snapper (fish)","weight":0.398687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_snapper_(fish)"},{"name":"Greater amberjack","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_amberjack"},{"name":"Ciguatoxin","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciguatoxin"},{"name":"Amberjack","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amberjack"},{"name":"Okinawa Prefecture","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture"},{"name":"Grouper","weight":0.328474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grouper"},{"name":"Seafood","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Bioassay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay"},{"name":"Minamitorishima","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamitorishima"},{"name":"Ctype.h","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctype.h"},{"name":"Oplegnathidae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oplegnathidae"},{"name":"Seriola","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seriola"},{"name":"Lutjanus bohar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutjanus_bohar"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Antidote","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidote"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"First baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman"},{"name":"Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Cambridge_Catalogue_of_Radio_Sources"},{"name":"Congener","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congener"},{"name":"Fish toxins","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_toxins"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_chromatography-mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Deoxygenation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxygenation"}]}
