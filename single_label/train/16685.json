{"id":16685,"title":"Detection and spread of oxa-48-producing Klebsiella oxytoca isolates in Istanbul, Turkey.","abstract":"Five OXA-48 producing Klebsiella oxytoca strains isolated in April-July 2010 were analyzed. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using disc diffusion method and VITEK 2 system. Carbapenemase activity was investigated using the Modified Hodge test. Beta-lactamase genes were detected by PCR and blaOXA-48 was sequenced. Genetic relatedness between K. oxytoca isolates was investigated by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Carbapenemase activity was detected in 5 isolates by Modified Hodge test. Although all strains were resistant to ertapenem and imipenem, only one strain was also resistant to meropenem. BlaOXA-48 in 4 isolates harbored 2 or 3 other ESBL types, namely, blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, or blaVEB. PFGE revealed 3 different pulso-types among the K. oxytoca isolates. The presence of OXA-48 carbapenemase in other species of clinical isolates should also be considered.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964661","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.742176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.568446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.479186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.408887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.356056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.254959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.242983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Imipenem","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"Ertapenem","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ertapenem"},{"name":"Genetic relationship (linguistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_relationship_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Istanbul","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul"},{"name":"Klebsiella oxytoca","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_oxytoca"},{"name":"Meropenem","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Coefficient of relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
