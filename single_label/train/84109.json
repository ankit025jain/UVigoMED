{"id":84109,"title":"Is nighttime the right time? Risk of complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy at night.","abstract":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomies can be performed at night in high-volume acute care hospitals. We hypothesized that nonelective nighttime laparoscopic cholecystectomies are associated with increased postoperative complications.We conducted a single-center retrospective review of consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients between October 2010 and May 2011 at a safety-net hospital in Houston, Texas. Data were collected on demographics, operative time, time of incision, length of stay, 30-day postoperative complications (ie, bile leak/biloma, common bile duct injury, retained stone, superficial surgical site infection, organ space abscess, and bleeding) and death. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA software (version 12; Stata Corp).During 8 months, 356 patients had nonelective laparoscopic cholecystectomies. A majority were female (n = 289 [81.1%]) and Hispanic (n = 299 [84%]). There were 108 (30%) nighttime operations. There were 29 complications in 18 patients; there were fewer daytime than nighttime patients who had at least 1 complication (4.0% vs 7.4%; p = 0.18). On multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio = 1.06 per year; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; p = 0.002), case duration (odds ratio = 1.02 per minute; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02; p = 0.001), and nighttime surgery (odds ratio = 3.33; 95% CI, 1.14-9.74; p = 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of 30-day surgical complications. Length of stay was significantly longer for daytime than nighttime patients (median 3 vs 2 days; p < 0.001).Age, case duration, and nighttime laparoscopic cholecystectomy were predictive of increased 30-day surgical complications at a high-volume safety-net hospital. The small but increased risk of complications with nighttime laparoscopic cholecystectomy must be balanced against improved efficiency at a high-volume, resource-poor hospital.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25172046","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.552917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Houston","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston"},{"name":"Texas","weight":0.398625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.373195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.354286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.197271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.176385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.0665607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.0453442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Stata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
