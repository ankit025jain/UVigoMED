{"id":91117,"title":"Radionuclides in nephrourology, part 1: Radiopharmaceuticals, quality control, and quantitative indices.","abstract":"Radionuclide renal scintigraphy provides important functional data to assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with a variety of suspected genitourinary tract problems, but the procedures are underutilized. Maximizing the utility of the available studies (as well as the perception of utility by referring physicians) requires a clear understanding of the clinical question, attention to quality control, acquisition of the essential elements necessary to produce an informed interpretation, and production of a report that presents a coherent impression that specifically addresses the clinical question and is supported by data contained in the report. To help achieve these goals, part 1 of this review covers information that should be provided to the patient before the scan, describes the advantages and limitations of the available radiopharmaceuticals, discusses quality control elements needed to optimize the study, summarizes approaches to the measurements of renal function, and focuses on recommended quantitative indices and their diagnostic applications. Although the primary focus is the adult patient, aspects of the review also apply to the pediatric population.
