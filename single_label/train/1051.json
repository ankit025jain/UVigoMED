{"id":1051,"title":"[The role of dietitian in cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention].","abstract":"Rehabilitation and secondary prevention programs are recognized as an essential part of the overall care of patients with cardiovascular disease. They consist of multidisciplinary strategies aiming at the reduction of modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There are some evidence of the efficacy of nutritional care in modifying eating habits and behavior in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. In 2007, the Italian Association of Dietitians (ANDID) appointed a working group of dietitians, skilled in nutrition applied in cardiovascular disease, with the aim to make an overview of the available scientific literature and to develop a Professional Position Paper on the role of Dietitian in cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention. The first Position Paper, developed in 2008, covered the available evidence about the dietitian professional role and contribution in the management of the topic. The working group has recently updated the contents by introducing, in agreement with the work done by ANDID, the methodology of the Nutrition Care Process and Model (NCP), a systematic problem-solving method intended to stimulate critical thinking, decision-making and address issues related to food and nutritional assistance, in order to provide a safe, effective and high quality care.","date":"2014-12-08","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481940","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Dietitian","weight":0.726839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.663323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.573334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Italian language","weight":0.546521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.23261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.119941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"2008 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Critical thinking","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking"}]}
