{"id":29499,"title":"Treatment of fetishism with naltrexone: a case report.","abstract":"Fetishism is a paraphilic sexual disorder characterized by recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors involving the use of nonliving objects. We describe a case of fetishism with comorbid alcohol and cannabis dependence. A 40-year-old man was presented with sexual fantasies and urges toward women's undergarments since the age of 25 years. He had fetish behavior even during prolonged period of abstinence from substance use. Our case remitted from fetishism and cannabis and alcohol use on treatment with naltrexone and maintains remission for the last 11 months. Experience with our patient suggests that naltrexone may be effective to treat fetishism with comorbid substance use. Our case is reported as it is the first reported case of successful use of naltrexone in fetishism comorbid with cannabis and alcohol dependence.
