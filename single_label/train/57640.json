{"id":57640,"title":"[Deep infiltrating endometriosis-diagnosis and principles of surgical treatment].","abstract":"\"Deep endometriosis\" includes rectovaginal lesions as well as infiltrative forms that involve vital structures such as bowel, ureters, and bladder. Deep endometriosis, defined as adenomyosis externa, mostly presents as a single nodule, larger than 1 cm in diameter, in the vesicouterine fold or close to the lower 20 cm of the bowel. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1% -2%. This disease is suspected clinically and can be confirmed by ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. The surgical treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis is challenging and complex. Currently, the gold standard for patient care is the referral to centers with a multidisciplinary team including gynecologists, colorectal surgeon and urologist with adequate training in advanced laparoscopic surgery.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098108","annotations":[{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.734376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.445241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colorectal surgery","weight":0.283688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_surgery"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Adenomyosis","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenomyosis"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"}]}
