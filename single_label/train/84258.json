{"id":84258,"title":"The impact of continuous driving time and rest time on commercial drivers' driving performance and recovery.","abstract":"This real road driving study was conducted to investigate the effects of driving time and rest time on the driving performance and recovery of commercial coach drivers.Thirty-three commercial coach drivers participated in the study, and were divided into three groups according to driving time: (a) 2 h, (b) 3 h, and (c) 4 h. The Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) was used to assess the subjective fatigue level of the drivers. One-way ANOVA was employed to analyze the variation in driving performance.The statistical analysis revealed that driving time had a significant effect on the subjective fatigue and driving performance measures among the three groups. After 2 h of driving, both the subjective fatigue and driving performance measures began to deteriorate. After 4 h of driving, all of the driving performance indicators changed significantly except for depth perception. A certain amount of rest time eliminated the negative effects of fatigue. A 15-minute rest allowed drivers to recover from a two-hour driving task. This needed to be prolonged to 30 min for driving tasks of 3 to 4 h of continuous driving.Drivers' attention, reactions, operating ability, and perceptions are all affected in turn after over 2 h of continuous driving. Drivers should take a certain amount of rest to recover from the fatigue effects before they continue driving.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142356","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Stanford University","weight":0.114958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Depth perception","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Siding Spring Survey","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siding_Spring_Survey"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Loudspeaker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker"},{"name":"Driving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving"},{"name":"Scale model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model"},{"name":"Coach (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)"},{"name":"Coachman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachman"},{"name":"One Way (South Korean band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Way_(South_Korean_band)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Sociolinguistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociolinguistics"},{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Performance indicator","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator"},{"name":"Performance measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_measurement"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"}]}
