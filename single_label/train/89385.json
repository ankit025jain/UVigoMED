{"id":89385,"title":"Primary repair of the acetabular labrum: outcomes with 2 years' follow-up.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to assess the results and outcomes of primary repair of the torn acetabular labrum.All patients undergoing hip arthroscopy are prospectively assessed solely with the modified Harris Hip Score, which is an outcomes tool. Over a 4-year period, 37 patients (38 hips) underwent primary repair of a torn acetabular labrum and had reached 2 years' follow-up. No cases were excluded. For perspective on the frequency of this procedure, the ratio of labral refixations after pincer femoroacetabular impingement correction to primary repairs was evaluated.The mean age was 26 years (range, 11 to 44 years). There were 26 female and 11 male patients, with 20 right and 18 left hips. The mean improvement in the modified Harris Hip Score was 18.9 points (70.5 points preoperatively and 89.4 points postoperatively), with 35 hips (92%) showing improvement, including good and excellent results in 35 hips (92%). Associated pathology included articular damage (21 hips), ligamentum teres (14 hips), cam femoroacetabular impingement (11 hips), borderline dysplasia (center-edge angle, 20° to 25°) (3 hips), dysplasia (center-edge angle <20°) (2 hips), and iliopsoas (2 hips). Four patients underwent repeat arthroscopy at a mean of 10 months (range, 5 to 15 months) postoperatively. The labral repair site was fully healed in each of these cases. There were no complications. During the study period, a total of 1,574 arthroscopic hip procedures were performed, including 439 labral refixations, representing an 11.6:1 ratio of refixation to repair.This study showed good clinical results of primary repair with favorable outcomes and evidence of good healing, even among the 11% of patients who required repeat arthroscopy.Level IV, therapeutic case series.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725313","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.469749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Acetabular labrum","weight":0.266968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabular_labrum"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Iliopsoas","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliopsoas"},{"name":"Femoral acetabular impingement","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_acetabular_impingement"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0829469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Ligament of head of femur","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament_of_head_of_femur"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cam","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"}]}
