{"id":19429,"title":"Recent advances in the prevention and management of complications associated with routine lumbar spine surgery.","abstract":"Lumbar spine surgery is often associated with complications in the perioperative and postoperative periods. Evidence-based literature in the prevention and management of adverse events, including surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, and positioning-related complications, has advanced the understanding of the etiology of these complications and preventive measures. Cost-effective measures to reduce intraoperative bleeding can lead to a lower incidence of infection, disease transmission, and morbidity in the postoperative period. As the healthcare system receives additional scrutiny with value-based assessments, surgeons, hospitals, and administrators will need to make critical decisions to prevent and manage the complications of lumbar spine surgery.
