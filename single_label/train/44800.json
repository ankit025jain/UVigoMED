{"id":44800,"title":"Supraesophageal reflux disease: a review of the literature.","abstract":"Supraesophageal reflux disease (SERD), defined as reflux proximal to the upper esophageal sphincter, is a common cause of morbidity of the upper aerodigestive tract, including rhinitis, laryngitis, cough, postnasal drip, and throat clearing. Although SERD has a high prevalence, the ideal means of diagnosing and treating the disease remain poorly defined. Evolving pH monitoring technology and a body of literature with conflicting reports regarding the best means for measuring and interpreting supraesophageal acidic reflux complicates the diagnosis of SERD. Treatment options include empiric acid suppression therapy, lifestyle modification, and surgery. However, limited data regarding the effectiveness of these strategies vary between studies and patient populations. It is the goal of this article to summarize the presentation and pathogenesis of SERD and to integrate the evolving body of literature pertaining to diagnostic and treatment strategies.
