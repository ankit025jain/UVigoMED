{"id":59720,"title":"[Second transplantation for 22 patients with graft failure after first allogeneic stem cell transplantation].","abstract":"To improve the understanding of treatment for graft failure by analyzing the efficacy of second transplantation for graft failure after first allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Twenty-two patients encountered graft failure after first allo-HSCT from Peking University Institute of Hematology were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence of re-engratment, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed. Also the factors associated with re-engraftment and OS were analyzed in multivariate model.Twenty-two patients encountered graft failure, including 12 primary graft failure and 10 secondary graft failure. 13(59.1%) patients acquired engraftment. And 13 patients acquired neutropil engraftment with median time of 15 (7-26) days, while 9 patients acquired platelet engraftment with median time of 12 (7-14) days. None of the factors included in mulivariate analysis showed impact on engraftment. The treatment related mortality at 100 day and 3 years after second transplantation was 40.9% and 72.7%, respectively. The main cause of death was infection (13/17). The 3-year OS was 22.7%, and the main cause of death was infection (13/17). The factors associated with OS included primary graft failure [P=0.001, HR 40.207 (4.828-334.868)] and receiving second transplantation in 60 days after first transplantation [P=0.003, HR 12.340 (2.290-66.498)].Second transplantation may be an effective salvage choice for graft failure. However, the efficacy was far from satisfactory.","date":"2014-08-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152110","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.746694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.717027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.387767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Peking University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"1359","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1359"},{"name":"868","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868"},{"name":"726","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/726"},{"name":"1317","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1317"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
