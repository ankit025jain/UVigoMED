{"id":13998,"title":"Heat-killed VSL#3 ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute experimental colitis in rats.","abstract":"To determine the effects of heat-killed VSL#3 (B. breve, B. longum and B. infantis; L. plantarum, L. bulgaricus, L. casei and L. acidophilus; S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus) therapy in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute experimental colitis in rats. Acute experimental colitis was induced in rats by 5% DSS and freely drink for seven days. Beginning on Day 8, rats underwent gavage once daily for seven days with heat-killed probiotic VSL#3 (0.6 g/kg/day), colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically seven days after gavage. Expression of inflammatory related mediators (STAT3, P-STAT3) and cytokines (IL-6, IL-23, TGF?) in colonic tissue were detected. The results revealed that heat-killed and live VSL#3 have identical anti-inflammatory properties by the assessed DAI (disease activity index), colon length, histological tissue and MPO activity. Heat-killed and live VSL#3 results in reduced IL-6, IL-23, TGF?, STAT3 and P-STAT3 expression in colonic tissue. Heat-killed and live VSL#3 have showed the similar anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting IL-6/STAT3 pathway in the DSS-induced acute experimental colitis in rats.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451125","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.757353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.728326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.677963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.652012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.567905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.471712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Lactobacillus acidophilus","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_acidophilus"},{"name":"Dextran","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextran"},{"name":"Lactobacillus plantarum","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_plantarum"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.345037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.296149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lactobacillus casei","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_casei"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.189562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Streptococcus salivarius","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_salivarius"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"24 (season 8)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(season_8)"},{"name":"Breve","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breve"},{"name":"Syllable weight","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_weight"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"}]}
