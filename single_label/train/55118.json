{"id":55118,"title":"Antioxidant and inflammatory cytokine in tears of patients with dry eye syndrome treated with preservative-free versus preserved eye drops.","abstract":"To compare the antioxidant and inflammatory cytokine activities in tears of patients with dry eye syndrome treated with preservative-free versus preserved eye drops.A total of 100 patients with moderate to severe dry eye syndrome were randomly divided into two groups. Fifty patients (group 1) were treated four times with preservative-free 0.1% sodium hyaluronate and 0.1% fluorometholone eye drops in the first month and with preservative-free 0.1% sodium hyaluronate and 0.05% cyclosporine eye drops in the second and third months. Another 50 patients (group 2) were treated with preserved eye drops on the same schedule. Ocular Surface Disease Index, corneal fluorescein staining, Schirmer I test, tear film breakup time, impression cytology, and antioxidant and inflammatory cytokine activities in tears were evaluated.Treatment with preservative-free eye drops led to significant improvements in symptoms, tear film breakup time, Schirmer I score, and impression cytologic findings compared to treatment with preserved eye drops (P < 0.05) in patients with dry eye syndrome. There was a statistically significant decrease in the IL-1?, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-? concentrations and a statistically significant increase in the catalase, peroxiredoxin 2, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD 2), and thioredoxin mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of tears in the preservative-free group at 1, 2, and 3 months compared to initial values, respectively (P < 0.05).Treatment with preservative-free eye drops is effective against the dry eye syndrome. Preservative-free eye drops seem to be more effective than preserved eye drops in decreasing ocular inflammation and in increasing antioxidant contents in tears of patients with dry eye syndrome.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24994869","annotations":[{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.90016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.832728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.821218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.681201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.636064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.518756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.486326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Thioredoxin","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thioredoxin"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.342331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.337213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cytopathology","weight":0.226611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytopathology"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.2144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluorometholone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorometholone"},{"name":"Peroxiredoxin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxiredoxin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Irradiance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"}]}
