{"id":12522,"title":"Fibroblast growth factor-5 participates in the progression of hepatic fibrosis.","abstract":"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by the presence of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis and is believed to develop via a \"two-hit process\"; however, its pathophysiology remains unclear. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are heparin-binding polypeptides with diverse biological activities in many developmental and metabolic processes. In particular, FGF5 is associated with high blood pressure. We investigated the function of FGF5 in vivo using spontaneously Fgf5 null mice and explored the role of diet in the development of NASH. Mice fed a high-fat diet gained little weight and had higher serum alanine transaminase, aspartate amino transferase, and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. Liver histology indicated marked inflammation, focal necrosis, fat deposition, and fibrosis, similar to the characteristics of NASH. FGF5 and a high-fat diet play significant roles in the pathophysiology of hepatic fibrosis and Fgf5 null mice may provide a suitable model for liver fibrosis or NASH.
