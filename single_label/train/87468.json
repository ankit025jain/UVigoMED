{"id":87468,"title":"A nationwide survey of trauma center information technology leverage capacity for mental health comorbidity screening.","abstract":"Despite evidence that electronic medical record (EMR) information technology innovations can enhance the quality of trauma center care, few investigations have systematically assessed United States (US) trauma center EMR capacity, particularly for screening of mental health comorbidities.Trauma programs at all US level I and II trauma centers were contacted and asked to complete a survey regarding health information technology (IT) and EMR capacity.Three hundred ninety-one of 525 (74%) US level I and II trauma centers responded to the survey. More than 90% of trauma centers reported the ability to create custom patient tracking lists in their EMR. Forty-seven percent of centers were interested in automating a blood alcohol content screening process; only 14% reported successfully using their EMR to perform this task. Marked variation was observed across trauma center sites with regard to the types of EMR systems used as well as rates of adoption and turnover of EMR systems.Most US level I and II trauma centers have installed EMR systems; however, marked heterogeneity exists with regard to EMR type, available features, and turnover. A minority of centers have leveraged their EMR for screening of mental health comorbidities among trauma inpatients. Greater attention to effective EMR use is warranted from trauma accreditation organizations.","date":"2014-08-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25151344","annotations":[{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.795373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.640254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.619056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.563467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.535986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Electronic medical record","weight":0.478575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_medical_record"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.408308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.407621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.378155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.29681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.238822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Blood alcohol content","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Professional certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Telemetry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry"},{"name":"Transportation Security Administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration"},{"name":"Revenue","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Educational accreditation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_accreditation"}]}
