{"id":71391,"title":"Activation of the leukemia plasmacytoid dendritic cell line PMDC05 by Toho-1, a novel IDO inhibitor.","abstract":"Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a rate-limiting enzyme for tryptophan metabolism and plays an immunosuppressive role. Antigen-presenting cells, when activated, increase the expression of IDO, which results in the suppression of subsequent immune reaction. A novel IDO inhibitor, Toho-1, was explored for its applicability to immunotherapy.We investigated the effects of Toho-1 on antigen presentation and antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-inducing ability of leukemia plasmacytoid dendritic cell line PMDC05, which was established in our laboratory.While antigen presentation-associated molecules in PMDC05 cells were increased by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-?, IDO mRNA and protein expression were also enhanced. Such treatment of PMDC05 cells in combination with Toho-1 enhanced the antigen-presenting and CTL-inducing ability of PMDC05 cells.These findings suggest the ability of Toho-1 to potentiate antigen-presenting cells and its applicability in immunotherapy of cancer.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075025","annotations":[{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Tryptophan","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Antigen presentation","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen_presentation"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.682266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.360544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.323684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Oxygenase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenase"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
