{"id":90905,"title":"Temporary external fixation facilitates open reduction and internal fixation of intra-articular calcaneal fractures.","abstract":"Management of intra-articular calcaneal fractures during the past years has ranged from the nihilistic approach of no active treatment to open reduction and internal fixation or even to early subtalar arthrodesis. Operative treatment presents the surgeon with many challenges. Good results require atraumatic exposure, anatomic reduction, rigid fixation and early mobilization. We describe the use of a temporary external fixator as an intraoperative aid in the open reduction and internal fixation of intra-articular calcaneal fractures. We propose this operative strategy as an option for the treatment of calcaneal fractures. The controlled distractive force provides numerous benefits. These include improved exposure of the subtalar joint, correction of angulation and maintenance of temporary stability prior to definitive fixation. We have found this technique applicable and easily reproducible.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563983","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.548341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.364698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.329941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Nihilism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism"},{"name":"Arthrodesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrodesis"},{"name":"Subtalar joint","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtalar_joint"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.0239124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Calcaneus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneus"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
