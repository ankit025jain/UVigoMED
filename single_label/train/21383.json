{"id":21383,"title":"[Protective effect of miliacin during experimental salmonellosis infection].","abstract":"Evaluation of influence of triterpenoid miliacin on the development of experimental salmonellosis infection.Studies were carried out in 330 male mice (CBAxC57Bl6)F1. Miliacin was administered 3 times intraperitoneally with the interval of 3 days between administrations at a single dose of 2 mg/kg. The animals were infected intraperitoneally by hospital origin Salmonella enteritidis strain (2x10(6) bacteria per mice). 4 groups of mice were used: I - intact; II - infected; III - infected after administering solvent for miliacin 3 times (tween 21 at final concentration of 1.6x 10(-7) mol/kg); IV - infected after administration ofmiliacin.Miliacin reduced the mortality of mice compared with groups II and III. Microbial contamination of mice spleen in group IV was significantly lower compared with group II at all the periods of the study, and liver - at days 10 and 15. Triterpenoid weakened cell depletion of bone marrow, thymus and limited hyperplasia of spleen compared with animals of groups II and III. Its protective effect did not correlate with increase of antibody titers.Miliacin weakens the severity of salmonellosis infection course.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605668","annotations":[{"name":"Salmonella","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.719838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Salmonella enterica enterica","weight":0.71905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica_enterica"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.576714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.565351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.464844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.353725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.246605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Salmonellosis","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonellosis"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.214915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Terpene","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene"},{"name":"White pulp","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_pulp"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
