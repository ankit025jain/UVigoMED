{"id":68057,"title":"Radiation safety considerations for the use of ²²³RaCl? DE in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.","abstract":"The majority of patients with late stage castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) develop bone metastases that often result in significant bone pain. Therapeutic palliation strategies can delay or prevent skeletal complications and may prolong survival. An alpha-particle based therapy, radium-223 dichloride (²²³RaCl?), has been developed that delivers highly localized effects in target areas and likely reduces toxicity to adjacent healthy tissue, particularly bone marrow. Radiation safety aspects were evaluated for a single comprehensive cancer center clinical phase 1, open-label, single ascending-dose study for three cohorts at 50, 100, or 200 kBq kg?¹ body weight. Ten patients received administrations, and six patients completed the study with 1 y follow-up. Dose rates from patients administered ²²³Ra dichloride were typically less than 2 ?Sv h?¹ MBq?¹ on contact and averaged 0.02 ?Sv h?¹ MBq?¹ at 1 m immediately following administration. Removal was primarily by fecal excretion, and whole body effective half-lives were highly dependent upon fecal compartment transfer, ranging from 2.5-11.4 d. Radium-223 is safe and straightforward to administer using conventional nuclear medicine equipment. For this clinical study, few radiation protection limitations were recommended post-therapy based on facility evaluations. Specific precautions are dependent on local regulatory authority guidance. Subsequent studies have demonstrated significantly improved overall survival and very low toxicity, suggesting that ²²³Ra may provide a new standard of care for patients with CRPC and bone metastases.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562070","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Becquerel","weight":0.847427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel"},{"name":"Radium","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium"},{"name":"Nuclear medicine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.709043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.531935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Bone pain","weight":0.487823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_pain"},{"name":"Bone tumor","weight":0.429203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_tumor"},{"name":"Sievert","weight":0.344028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.3432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Radiation protection","weight":0.250046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.107426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"German language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Osmium tetroxide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmium_tetroxide"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"NCI-designated Cancer Center","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCI-designated_Cancer_Center"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
