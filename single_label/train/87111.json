{"id":87111,"title":"Youth, new media, and HIV/AIDS: determinants of participation in an online health social movement.","abstract":"Abstract This paper focuses on the Global Youth Coalition for HIV/AIDS (GYCA), a collaboration of young people who utilize the Internet to organize and inform the global youth HIV/AIDS social movement. We used a trans-disciplinary conceptual framework guided by the diffusion of innovations approach to explore factors that influence online participation among the coalition's members and to explain perceived effects of participation. We used a randomized stratified sampling strategy to conduct an online 7 week survey of GYCA's members (n=275). Descriptive statistics revealed that the majority of participants were from Africa (?54%) and Asia (?24%), with an average age of 27 years. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that participation in the e-consultations (R(2)=0.39, p<0.001) was influenced by a greater number of factors compared to the listserv (R(2)=0.20, p<0.001). Online participation significantly influenced perceptions about the coalition's social networking utility (R(2)=0.21, p<0.001). Perceived social networking utility significantly explained perceived effects on program areas such as knowledge sharing (R(2)=0.49, p<0.001), capacity building (R(2)=0.48, p<0.001), and political advocacy (R(2)=0.44, p<0.001). We concluded that a range of factors shapes participation in online health social movements. Initiatives such as GYCA need regular, intensive assessments to understand these factors for better tailoring their online activities to members' needs and for greater impact.
