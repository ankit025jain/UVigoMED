{"id":52017,"title":"Cost-effectiveness of statins for primary prevention in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands.","abstract":"Statins are lipid-lowering drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes.The objective of this study was to determine whether statin treatment for primary prevention in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes is cost-effective, taking nonadherence, baseline risk, and age into account.A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by using a Markov model with a time horizon of 10 years. The baseline 10-year cardiovascular risk was estimated in a Dutch population of primary prevention patients with newly diagnosed diabetes from the Groningen Initiative to Analyse Type 2 Diabetes Treatment (GIANTT) database, using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study risk engine. Statin adherence was measured as pill days covered in the IADB.nl pharmacy research database. Cost-effectiveness was measured in costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from the health care payers' perspective.For an average patient aged 60 years, the base case, statin treatment was highly cost-effective at €2245 per QALY. Favorable cost-effectiveness was robust in sensitivity analysis. Differences in age and 10-year cardiovascular risk showed large differences in cost-effectiveness from almost €100,000 per QALY to almost being cost saving. Treating all patients younger than 45 years at diabetes diagnosis was not cost-effective (weighted cost-effectiveness of almost €60,000 per QALY).Despite the nonadherence levels observed in actual practice, statin treatment is cost-effective for primary prevention in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Because of large differences in cost-effectiveness according to different risk and age groups, the efficiency of the treatment could be increased by targeting patients with relatively higher cardiovascular risk and higher ages.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636380","annotations":[{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.685797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.640298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.63151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.608052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.59798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.571019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.487161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Dutch language","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Inter-American Development Bank","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-American_Development_Bank"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Internal combustion engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine"},{"name":"Horizon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Pill (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Quality-adjusted life year","weight":0.010864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year"}]}
