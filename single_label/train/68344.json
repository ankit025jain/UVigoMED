{"id":68344,"title":"Prospective multi-center study elucidating patient experience after prostatic urethral lift.","abstract":"The prostatic urethral Lift (PUL) procedure offers a novel treatment for men with lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Most patients who seek LUTS/BPH treatment choose the intervention that offers the expectations of a significant improvement in quality of life and the least chance of short or long term morbidity. We report the results of a prospective, non-randomized study designed to further characterize the perioperative subject experience with the PUL procedure.The PUL procedure employs permanent implants to mechanically pull the prostatic lateral lobes apart. Subjects were ? 50 years old with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) ? 12, peak flow rate ? 12 mL, and prostate volume between 30 cc and 80 cc. Subject experience through 1 month was characterized by validated instruments designed to assess quality of recovery, work productivity, activity impairment, symptom response, quality of life, flow rate and sexual function.Fifty-one subjects were treated without any serious adverse events. No case was abandoned or postponed due to subject discomfort. By 1 month, 86% of subjects achieved high quality recovery as measured by a score of ? 80 on the Quality of Recovery Visual Analog Scale. Ninety percent of subjects reported improvement in their condition and 75% of subjects would recommend the procedure to a friend. Symptom response, flow rate improvement, and sexual function preservation were comparable to published studies.The PUL procedure was tolerated under local anesthesia, rarely required postoperative catheterization, and offered rapid LUTS relief with minimal associated morbidity. The study further allows urologists to advise patients regarding post-procedural expectations and side effects, inclusive of symptomatic benefit.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529008","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.768836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.725212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.716536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.679806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.455405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Sexual function","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_function"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Polyurethane","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
