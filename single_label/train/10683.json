{"id":10683,"title":"FIV in cats--a useful model of HIV in people?","abstract":"The feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) shares genomic organization, receptor usage, lymphocyte tropism, and induction of immunodeficiency and increased susceptibility to cancer with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Global distribution, marked heterogeneity and variable host adaptation are also properties of both viruses. These features render the FIV-cat model suitable to explore many aspects of lentivirus-host interaction and adaptation, and to explore treatment and prevention of infection. Examples of fundamental discoveries that have emerged from study in the FIV-cat model concern two-receptor entrance strategies that target memory T-lymphocytes, host factors that restrict retroviral infection, viral strategies for replication in non-dividing cells, and identification of correlates of immunity to the virus. This article provides a brief overview of strengths and limitations of the FIV-cat model for comparative biology and medicine.
