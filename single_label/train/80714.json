{"id":80714,"title":"Measuring resistant-genotype transmission of malaria parasites: challenges and prospects.","abstract":"Increased gametocytemia in infections with resistant strains of Plasmodium species and their enhanced transmissibility are a matter of concern in planning and evaluating the impact of malaria control strategies. Various studies have determined weekly gametocyte carriage in response to antimalarial drugs in clinical trials. The advent of molecular biology techniques makes it easy to detect and quantify gametocytes, the stages responsible for transmission, and to detect resistant genotypes of the parasite. With the validation of molecular markers of resistance to certain antimalarial drugs, there is a need to devise a simpler formula that could be used with these epidemiological antimalarial resistance tools. Theoretical models for transmission of resistant malaria parasites are difficult to deploy in epidemiological studies. Therefore, devising a simple formula that determines the potential resistant-genotype transmission of malaria parasites should provide further insights into understanding the spread of drug resistance. The present perspective discusses gametocytogenesis in the context of antimalarial treatment and drug resistance. It also highlights the difficulties in applying the available theoretical models of drug resistance transmission and suggests Rashad's devised formula that could perhaps be used in determining potentially transmissible resistant genotypes as well as in mapping areas with high potential risk for the transmission of drug-resistant malaria. The suggested formula makes use of the data on gametocytes and resistant genotypes of malaria parasites, detected by molecular techniques in a certain geographical area within a particular point in time, to calculate the potential risk of resistant genotype transmission.
