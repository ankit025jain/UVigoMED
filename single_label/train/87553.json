{"id":87553,"title":"Using nurse-led liaison to prevent further fractures.","abstract":"Osteoporosis-related fractures are common and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Having one such fracture at least doubles the risk of experiencing another. Nurse-led assessment of future fracture risk and of any underlying osteoporosis can ensure treatment is offered to reduce the risk of another fracture. However, many hospitals do not offer a fracture liaison service, although evidence shows these services deliver high-quality care in a systematic way and are cost effective. In Glasgow, hip fracture rates have fallen over a decade since a fracture liaison service, was introduced while fracture rates have risen elsewhere. Nurses working in hospitals that do not have secondary prevention services should advise patients to seek these through their GP.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095567","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.764193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.684931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.573664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.407755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.32116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Glasgow","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Double (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)"},{"name":"Systematic theology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_theology"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Affair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair"}]}
