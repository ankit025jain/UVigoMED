{"id":12928,"title":"Suppression of dsDNA-specific B lymphocytes reduces disease symptoms in SCID model of mouse lupus.","abstract":"Self-specific B cells play a main role in the pathogenesis of lupus. This autoimmune disease is characterized by the generation of autoantibodies against self antigens, and the elimination of B and T cells involved in the pathological immune response is a logical approach for effective therapy. We have previously constructed a chimeric molecule by coupling a DNA-mimotope peptides to an anti-CD32 antibody. Using this protein molecule for the treatment of lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, we suppressed selectively the autoreactive B-lymphocytes by cross-linking B cell receptors with the inhibitory Fc?RIIb receptors. This approach was limited by the development of anti-chimeric antibodies in MRL mice. In order to avoid this problem, we established a murine severe combined immunodeficiency lupus model, allowing a long-term chimera therapy. Elimination of the double-stranded DNA-specific B cells by chimera therapy in MRL-transferred immunodeficient mice resulted in inhibition of T cell proliferation and prevented the appearance of IgG anti-DNA antibodies and of proteinuria.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502777","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Severe combined immunodeficiency","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_combined_immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.820686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.812649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.810514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.799206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Chimera (genetics)","weight":0.797544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.796656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.776685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.540191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.46853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.462308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0229663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
