{"id":55166,"title":"Effectiveness of touch and feel (TAF) technique on first aid measures for visually challenged.","abstract":"There is a common perception that a blind person cannot even help his own self. In order to challenge that view, a workshop for visually-impaired people to develop the skills to be independent and productive members of society was conceived. An experimental study was conducted at National Institute of Visually Handicapped, Chennai with the objective to assess the effectiveness of Touch and Feel (TAF) technique on first aid measures for the visually challenged. Total 25 visually challenged people were selected by non-probability purposive sampling technique and data was collected using demographic variable and structured knowledge questionnaire. The score obtained was categorised into three levels: inadequate (0-8), moderately adequate (8 - 17), adequate (17 -25). The study revealed that most of the visually challenged (40%) had inadequate knowledge, and 56 percent had moderately adequate and only few (4%) had adequate knowledge in the pre-test, whereas most (68%) of them had adequate knowledge in the post-test which is statistically significant at p < 0.000 with t-value 6.779. This proves that TAF technique was effective for the visually challenged. There was no association between the demographic variables and their level of knowledge regarding first aid.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974530","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.6682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.62635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.433055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Nonprobability sampling","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprobability_sampling"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.304795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Chennai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"779","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/779"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Workshop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Terminal Aerodrome Forecast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_Aerodrome_Forecast"},{"name":"Purpose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose"},{"name":"Productivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"First aid","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid"}]}
