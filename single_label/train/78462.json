{"id":78462,"title":"Frequency and factors associated with use of videolaryngostroboscopy in voice disorder assessment.","abstract":"Videolaryngostroboscopy (VLS) is considered an important diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with laryngeal/voice disorders. We evaluated the frequency of, diagnoses associated with, and factors related to VLS use in the evaluation of outpatients with laryngeal/voice disorders.Retrospective analysis of a large, national administrative U.S. claims database.Patients with a laryngeal disorder based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2008, seen by an otolaryngologist were included. Patient age, gender, geographic region, laryngeal diagnosis, comorbid conditions, and whether laryngoscopy or VLS was performed during the outpatient otolaryngology visit were collected.A total of 168,444 unique patients saw an otolaryngologist for 272,112 outpatient visits. Of those, 6.2% of outpatient otolaryngology visits had a VLS performed. Patient age was related to VLS use, with lower odds in the elderly (? 65 years of age) and those 0 to 17 years of age. Geographic variation was noted, with higher odds of VLS use in urban versus rural areas and greater odds in the Northeast versus the South. Laryngeal diagnosis was associated with VLS use with greatest odds for patients with multiple diagnoses, vocal fold paralysis, and paresis-followed by nonspecific dysphonia and benign vocal fold/laryngeal pathology and followed by acute and chronic laryngitis and laryngeal cancer. Patients with gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) had greater odds of VLS use than patients without GER.VLS was used in 6.2% of outpatient otolaryngology outpatient visits; and its use was influenced by multiple factors.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659429","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.750636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.642039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.461308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.323041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.258867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.237827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.218284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.17956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Laryngitis","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngitis"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.162069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0370354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Dysphonia","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphonia"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"List of voice disorders","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_voice_disorders"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"}]}
