{"id":73236,"title":"Vitamin D supplements and cancer incidence and mortality: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Observational studies suggest that effects of vitamin D may be stronger for cancer mortality than for incidence. Yet, existing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation have limited power to examine the relationships as their primary end points are not cancer incidence or mortality.Meta-analyses of RCTs of vitamin D supplementation and total cancer incidence and mortality were conducted.Over 2-7 years of duration, vitamin D supplementations had little effect on total cancer incidence (400-1100?IU per day, summary relative risk (RR)=1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.94-1.06, I(2)=0%; four RCTs with combined 4333 cases), but significantly reduced total cancer mortality (400-833?IU per day, summary RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.78-0.98, I(2)=0%, three RCTs with combined 1190 deaths).Over 2-7 years of duration, the benefit of vitamin D supplementation may be limited to cancer mortality.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918818","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.79852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.495338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.447954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.290349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistical power","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"780","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/780"},{"name":"1190","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1190"},{"name":"941","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/941"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Interstate 20","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_20"}]}
