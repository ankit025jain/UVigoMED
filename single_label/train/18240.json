{"id":18240,"title":"Local delivery of linezolid from poly-D,L-lactide (PDLLA)-linezolid-coated orthopaedic implants to prevent MRSA mediated post-arthroplasty infections.","abstract":"The present study focuses on the use of linezolid as local delivery agent for direct administration of the drug at the orthopaedic implant site. Local drug delivery system with linezolid added to the Poly D, L-(Lactide) polymer solution was used to coat the orthopaedic grade K-wires. Bacterial adherence on K-wires was then determined to evaluate the effect of the coated drug on the adherence of MRSA. A significant decrease in bacterial adherence as compared to naked wires was observed on all the coated K-wires (2.5, 5 and 10% w/w linezolid coated) with maximum decrease of 60%. This represents an aggressive early approach to prevent initial adherence of bacterial population. With the rise in MRSA mediated orthopaedic device related infections, the use of linezolid loaded polymer coated implants is definitely an attractive strategy against drug resistant strains of S. aureus.
