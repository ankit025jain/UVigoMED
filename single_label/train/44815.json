{"id":44815,"title":"Combined effects of recipient age and model for end-stage liver disease score on liver transplantation outcomes.","abstract":"The proportion of older patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT) is rising. Although increased age and LT-MELD are known to increase the risk of graft loss, no studies have explored whether there is a synergistic effect between LT-age and LT-MELD.All US adult, non-Status 1 recipients of primary deceased donor LT from 2/05 to 1/10 without MELD exceptions were included (n=15,677). Recipients were categorized by LT-age [18-59 yr (n=11,966), 60-64 yr (n=2181), 65-69 yr (n=1177), and ?70 yr (n=343)] and LT-MELD [low (<20, n=5290), mid (20-27, n=5112), and high (?28, n=5265)]. Adjusted Cox models evaluated the independent and combined effects of LT-age and LT-MELD on graft loss (death or re-LT).LT-age ?70 yr (HR=1.65, 95% CI 1.08-1.82) and LT-MELD ?28 (HR=1.46, 95% CI 1.02-1.47) were independently associated with increased risk of graft loss (P<0.001). In a model allowing for the interaction between LT-age and LT-MELD, the risk of graft loss for recipients ?70 years with MELD ?28 was higher than predicted by the additive model (HR=2.38, 95% CI 1.73-3.27, P<0.001) resulting in 1-year graft survival of 56%. However, the increased risk of graft loss in recipients ?70 years was attenuated at lower LT-MELD <28. Furthermore, the interaction term was not significant for any other LT-age and LT-MELD combination.Our analyses suggest that recipients should not be excluded solely based on age; however, LT for recipients ?70 years at high LT-MELD scores should be undertaken cautiously.","date":"2014-08-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717221","annotations":[{"name":"Liver","weight":0.77322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.631935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.29111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.28724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Croatian Radiotelevision","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Radiotelevision"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"1859","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1859"},{"name":"966","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/966"},{"name":"1177","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1177"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"22nd century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22nd_century_BC"},{"name":"2027","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2027"},{"name":"Lieutenant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Additive model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_model"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"}]}
