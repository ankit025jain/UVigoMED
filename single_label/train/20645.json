{"id":20645,"title":"Human cathelicidin LL-37 resistance and increased daptomycin MIC in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain USA600 (ST45) are associated with increased mortality in a hospital setting.","abstract":"Bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) USA600 has been associated with increased patient mortality. We found that USA600 MRSA exhibited significantly increased resistance to human cathelicidin LL-37 killing and daptomycin MIC creep compared to non-USA600 MRSA. Virulent health care-associated MRSA strains may coevolve innate host defense peptide and antibiotic resistances.
