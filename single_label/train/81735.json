{"id":81735,"title":"Dental clearance prior to elective arthroplasty may not be needed for everyone.","abstract":"We investigated the prevalence and risk factors for preoperative dental clearance failure in joint arthroplasty patients. Over a 5-month period, all patients scheduling total joint arthroplasty completed a dental questionnaire. Data collected included demographics, medical and dental history, dental hygiene practices, frequency of dental care, and results of dental clearance. Of the 300 patients, 35 (12%) failed dental clearance. Risk factors included tobacco use, poor flossing habits, history of tooth extraction, age, narcotic use, and lack of a dentist visit within 12 months. Of 189 patients who lacked the 3 least prevalent risk factors (tobacco use, narcotic use, no dental visit within 12 months), 11 (6%) failed dental clearance. Selective dental clearance based on patient risk stratification may be a reasonable approach.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851786","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Narcotic","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic"},{"name":"Dental floss","weight":0.658814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_floss"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.55342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Dental hygienist","weight":0.542522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_hygienist"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.522274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Controlled Substances Act","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act"},{"name":"189","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/189"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
