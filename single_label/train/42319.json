{"id":42319,"title":"[Reconstruction of pancreatic enteric anastomosis after pancreaticoduodenectomy].","abstract":"Pancreatic enteric anastomosis is an important step during pancreaticoduodenectomy. Based on the anastomosis site, pancreatic enteric anastomosis is classified as pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis and pancreaticogastrostomy. Depending on the jejunum site, reconstruction can be perform as end-to-end or end-to-side anastomosis. Previous randomized clinical trials, showed no significant differences between pancreaticojejunostomy and pancreaticogastrostomy. Binding pancreaticojejunostomy and binding pancreaticogastrostomy are easy to perform. The rate of pancreatic leakage is related to the texture of the pancreas and the size of the pancreatic duct. It is helpful to reduce pancreatic leakage by placing a pancreatic duct stent. The simple and effective pancreatic enteric reconstruction is the future direction for minimizing leakage.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24859947","annotations":[{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreaticoduodenectomy"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.736357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.258737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
