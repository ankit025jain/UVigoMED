{"id":47123,"title":"Thioridazine, an antipsychotic drug, elicits potent antitumor effects in gastric cancer.","abstract":"Thioridazine, an antipsychotic drug, has been reported to induce apoptosis in various types of cancer cells, with specificity on targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, whether it elicits anticancer effects in gastric cancer has never been reported. In the present study, we examined the ability of thioridazine to induce cell death in the gastric cancer cell lines NCI-N87 and AGS, and detected its in vivo tumor inhibition capacity. Thioridazine elicited cytotoxic effects on NCI-N87 and AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibited the colony formation abilitiy of the NCI-N87 and AGS cells. Thioridazine treatment induced nuclear fragmentation, increased the proportion of sub-G1 phase cells, and elevated the percentage of Annexin V-positive cells, suggesting the occurrence of apoptosis. Moreover, thioridazine induced gastric cancer cell apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner, as shown by a decrease in the precursors of casapse-9, caspase-8 and caspase-3, and by the ability of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK to reverse the cytotoxic effect of thioridazine. JC-1 staining further revealed that thioridazine induced gastric cancer cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. In addition, thioridazine pretreatment inhibited the growth of NCI-N87 cell-derived tumors. The present study demonstrated that the antipsychotic drug thioridazine possesses anti-gastric cancer ability through in vitro and in vivo experiments, suggesting thioridazine as a potential drug in gastric cancer therapy.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604290","annotations":[{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.888684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.582717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.579363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.536922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.455433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.164458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"JC virus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_virus"}]}
