{"id":20104,"title":"Long-term carriage of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2-producing K pneumoniae after a large single-center outbreak in Germany.","abstract":"The natural progress of intestinal colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2-producing K pneumoniae (KPC-2-KP) is almost unknown.After a large, single-center outbreak of KPC-2-KP, we analyzed carrier prevalence through retrospective and prospective investigation of intestinal KPC-2-KP carriage 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after acquisition, defined as the earliest date of KPC-2-KP detection. Rectal swabs or stool samples were collected at baseline and at each visit and submitted for both culture and KPC-specific polymerase chain reaction. Resolution of intestinal KPC-2-KP carriage was defined as a minimum of 3 consecutive negative polymerase chain reaction test results separated by at least 48 hours.In patients available for long-term evaluation 26 out of 84 patients (31%) tested negative for KPC-2-KP after 1 month, 14 out of 34 (41%) after 3 months, 17 out of 26 (65%) after 6 months, 14 out of 19 (74%) after 1 year, and 5 out of 6 (83%) after 2 years. Decolonization of KPC-2-KP was hampered in patients with prolonged or repeated hospitalization (P = .044-.140, depending on the time interval). Two patients retested positive for KPC-2-KP after they had previously shown 3 consecutive negative tests. The longest positive KPC-2-KP carrier status so far was observed after nearly 40 months (1,191 days).The majority of patients experienced spontaneous decolonization within 6 months after acquisition, mainly after discharge from the hospital. However, long-term carriage of >3 years is possible. Appropriate infection control measures must be taken when these patients are readmitted to health care facilities. A series of at least 4 consecutive negative rectal swabs or stool samples separated by sufficient time intervals appears necessary before the declaration of successful KPC-2-KP decolonization is made.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679563","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.891656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.561886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.44261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.38509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.161443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.134465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Decolonization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization"},{"name":"Klebsiella pneumoniae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Klebsiella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella"},{"name":"ABC Mid North Coast","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Mid_North_Coast"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Aircraft carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Sailor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Resolution (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(law)"},{"name":"Order of St. Patrick","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St._Patrick"},{"name":"Infection control","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_control"}]}
