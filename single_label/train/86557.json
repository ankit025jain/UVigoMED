{"id":86557,"title":"Benefits of a continuous therapy for cancer patients with a novel adoptive cell therapy by cascade priming (CAPRI).","abstract":"A growing body of evidence shows that immune cells are pivotal in the fight against cancer. First, association studies have identified immune-protective immune response genes against cancer. Second, the presence of immune cells in the respective malignant tumor correlated with a better prognosis for the patients. Third, adoptive cell therapy (ACT) showed, in recent reports, an efficient reduction or even cure for malignant tumors. The focus of this review is a novel inÂ vitro ACT technique, using the patient's cascade-primed immune cells. The cascade-priming procedure stimulates APCs from the peripheral blood. Stimulated APCs digest and present tumor material better and differentiate naive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte effector cells against the patient's cancer. The principle and the impressive results of the cascade-primed immune cell treatment in patient case series is compared with the ACT concepts of lymphokine-activated killer, macrophage-activated killer, macrophage-activated killer-dendritic cell, cytokine-induced killer and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte methods.
