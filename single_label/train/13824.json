{"id":13824,"title":"Effects of chronic desipramine pretreatment on open field-induced suppression of blood natural killer cell activity and cytokine response depend on the rat's behavioral characteristics.","abstract":"Effects of 14 consecutive day exposure to desipramine (10mg/kg i.p.), by itself or following chronic open field (OF) exposure, on subsequent neuroimmunological effects of acute (30 min) OF stress and the involvement of individual differences in response to novelty or social position in the anti-depressive responsiveness were investigated. Chronic desipramine pretreatment did not protect against OF stress-induced suppression of blood anti-tumor natural killer cell activity but increased plasma interleukin-10 and decreased interferon-? and corticosterone concentration. These effects were particularly dangerous for the animals with increased responsivity to stress (desipramine alone) or with low behavioral activity (desipramine after chronic stress).","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461377","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.841951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Corticosterone","weight":0.799562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosterone"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.736555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.679258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic stress","weight":0.643121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.418114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.368449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Responsivity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsivity"},{"name":"Desipramine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desipramine"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Individual differences psychology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_differences_psychology"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Novelty song","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_song"},{"name":"Responsiveness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsiveness"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Open field system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_field_system"},{"name":"Social position","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_position"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
