{"id":52545,"title":"Study of fasting serum lipid and lipoproteins profile in type-II diabetic patients attending NMCTH.","abstract":"Dyslipidemia is one of the primary causes for cardio vascular disease (CVD) and development of myocardial infarction (MI) which often leads to coronary artery disease (CAD). The elevated level of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoproteins-cholesterol (LDL-C), and lowered high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) are the predictable risk factor for CAD with type-II diabetic patient. The present study was undertaken taken with an objective to frame out the lipid profile in type-II diabetic patients attending OPD (outpatient department) of Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital (NMCTH) Jorpati, Kathmandu. Samples of 148 individuals with age varying from 30-73 were analyzed. Out of which 96 patients were diabetic and 52 were control group. The mean +/- SD (mg/dl) levels of Cholesterol, TG and LDL-C were found significantly higher compared to non-diabetic, and these are statistically significant when compared with healthy control group. The study concludes that the study of accessing fasting lipid profile in type-II diabetic will be a tool of accessing risk for cardiovascular and other coronary artery complications.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592787","annotations":[{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.815528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Dyslipidemia","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslipidemia"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.6223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.555048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.472809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Nepal","weight":0.450248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.334077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.215461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Kathmandu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Transgender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"}]}
