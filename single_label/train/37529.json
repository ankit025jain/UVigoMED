{"id":37529,"title":"Therapeutic touch: influence on vital signs of newborns.","abstract":"To compare vital signs before and after the therapeutic touch observed in hospitalized newborns in neonatal intensive care unit.This was a quasi-experimental study performed at a neonatal intensive care unit of a municipal hospital, in the city of SÃ£o Paulo (SP), Brazil. The sample included 40 newborns submitted to the therapeutic touch after a painful procedure. We evaluated the vital signs, such as heart and respiratory rates, temperature and pain intensity, before and after the therapeutic touch.The majority of newborns were male (n=28; 70%), pre-term (n=19; 52%) and born from vaginal delivery (n=27; 67%). Respiratory distress was the main reason for hospital admission (n=16; 40%). There was a drop in all vital signs after therapeutic touch, particularly in pain score, which had a considerable reduction in the mean values, from 3.37 (SD=1.31) to 0 (SD=0.0). All differences found were statistically significant by the Wilcoxon test (p<0.05).The results showed that therapeutic touch promotes relaxation of the baby, favoring reduction in vital signs and, consequently in the basal metabolism rate.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488378","annotations":[{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.82741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.809336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.790221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Basal metabolic rate","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.732141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.727042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.682824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.667347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.652619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.282227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.276781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.103847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Therapeutic touch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_touch"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Relaxation technique","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_technique"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
