{"id":91412,"title":"Retrieval of a broken guide wire transfixing the hip through the proximal femoral nail hole.","abstract":"Retrieval of a broken guide wire transfixing the acetabulum or with intrapelvic migration is challenging and frustrating for surgeons. We here present a case report on a method to remove a broken guide wire transfixing the acetabulum through the proximal hole of recon nail using a grasping forceps. This method is little invasive, easy, time-saving and without need for changing the inital fixation.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506926","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.568358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.396415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.265097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.252897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.114892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Forceps","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forceps"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0169501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Reconnaissance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance"},{"name":"Bird migration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"},{"name":"Prehensility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehensility"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Recall (memory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)"}]}
