{"id":2980,"title":"[Preplacentation pregnancy loss in cases of angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism].","abstract":"The balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis processes is critical for establishment and development of early pregnancy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is related with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity which is a key regulator in embryo implantation. Therefor polymorphisms in ACE gene and variation in ACE activity could be associated with an early pregnancy wastage risk. This study investigated carrier status for insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in introne 16 of ACE gene in 71 women with two or more pregnancy loss in preplacentation period (between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation) and 75 women without pregnancy complications. DD genotype for I/D polymorphism was found respectively in 31% and 24% in patients and controls. Heterozygosity of D allele was found correspondingly in 47.9% and 54.7%. The dominant genetic model was used for allele prevalence comparison. D allele in DD genotype was not significantly prevalent in women with early pregnancy wastage compared with the control subjects, OR = 1.42, 95% CI (0.64-3.15). The study found a weak association between I/D polymorphism and preplacentation pregnancy loss. The additive effect over the pregnancy loss risk of I/D polymorphism could be supposed in a presence of other inherited or acquired factors connected with endometrial receptivity and implantation process.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510065","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Heterozygosity","weight":0.824566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygosity"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.760806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.650353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.555603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.497558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.361396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.219121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.194419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.161811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complications of pregnancy","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complications_of_pregnancy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0251131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme"},{"name":"First trimester bleeding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_trimester_bleeding"},{"name":"Behavioral addiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_addiction"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
