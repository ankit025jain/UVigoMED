{"id":88966,"title":"[Epidemiology of bone and joint disease - the present and future - . Health economics of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures].","abstract":"Osteoporotic fractures are associated with increased mortality, and impose a huge financial burden on healthcare systems. Preventing osteoporotic fractures in the elderly therefore represents an important issue in health economics. In recent years, it has also become increasingly important to consider the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of health technologies. Here we introduce the basic idea of health economic evaluation and study examples in the field of osteoporosis.
