{"id":89098,"title":"IL-1? associations with posttraumatic epilepsy development: a genetics and biomarker cohort study.","abstract":"Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a significant complication following traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet the role of genetic variation in modulating PTE onset is unclear. We hypothesized that TBI-induced inflammation likely contributes to seizure development. We assessed whether genetic variation in the interleukin-1beta (IL-1?) gene, IL-1? levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, and CSF/serum IL-1? ratios would predict PTE development post-TBI.We investigated PTE development in 256 Caucasian adults with moderate-to-severe TBI. IL-1? tagging and functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. Genetic variance and PTE development were assessed. Serum and CSF IL-1? levels were collected from a subset of subjects (n = 59) during the first week postinjury and evaluated for their associations with IL-1? gene variants, and also PTE. Temporally matched CSF/serum IL-1? ratios were also generated to reflect the relative contribution of serum IL-1? to CSF IL-1?.Multivariate analysis showed that higher CSF/serum IL-1? ratios were associated with increased risk for PTE over time (p = 0.008). Multivariate analysis for rs1143634 revealed an association between the CT genotype and increased PTE risk over time (p = 0.005). The CT genotype group also had lower serum IL-1? levels (p = 0.014) and higher IL-1? CSF/serum ratios (p = 0.093).This is the first report implicating IL-1? gene variability in PTE risk and linking (1) IL-1? gene variation with serum IL-1? levels observed after TBI and (2) IL-1? ratios with PTE risk. Given these findings, we propose that genetic and IL-1? ratio associations with PTE may be attributable to biologic variability with blood-brain barrier integrity during TBI recovery. These results provide a rationale for further studies (1) validating the impact of genetic variability on IL-1? production after TBI, (2) assessing genetically mediated signaling mechanisms that contribute to IL-1? CSF/serum associations with PTE, and (3) evaluating targeted IL-1? therapies that reduce PTE.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Wounds and
