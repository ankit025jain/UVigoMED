{"id":37269,"title":"Is three-dimensional prenatal ultrasound necessary: pregnant women's point of view.","abstract":"The role and applicability of three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) in perinatology has been repeatedly discussed in the literature. Regardless, our knowledge about patient expectations remains limited. We aimed at determining the expectations, perception and knowledge of pregnant women about 3D-US.Upon admission to the labor unit, the women filled out a questionnaire, with the help of a doctor investigating sociodemographic data, pregnancy and delivery history previous experiences and expectations for US imaging.A total of 644 pregnant women were included in the study Respondents declared that approximately 70% of all kinds of structural abnormalities could be detected by 3D-US and estimated its reliability at nearly 70%. While 60% of the participants underwent 3D-US, 70% of them believed that every pregnant woman should undergo such test. Also, 457 (70.9%) of the participants were of the opinion that every pregnant woman must undergo 3D-US imaging, whereas 173 (26.8%) did not think 3D-US imaging was necessaryTo the best of our knowledge, this has been the first study on patient opinions regarding the need for 3D-US imaging during pregnancy Although the participants were not certain about the harmful effects of 3D-US, the majority believed that it was necessary for every pregnant woman to undergo such testing. Obviously patients must be instructed on the limitations of US imaging before the examination to clarify any misunderstandings about the possibilities such a technique may offer","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505961","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.747207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.554488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.524062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.403423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.391224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.331498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"History","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.143593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.0867165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"Maternal-fetal medicine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal-fetal_medicine"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"644","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/644"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Greatest hits album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_hits_album"},{"name":"Obviously","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obviously"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Obstetric ultrasonography","weight":0.0144926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_ultrasonography"}]}
