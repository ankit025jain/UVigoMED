{"id":82395,"title":"Focussed microarray analysis of apoptosis in periodontitis and its potential pharmacological targeting by carvacrol.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to perform a landscape analysis of apoptosis-related genes/proteins and to study the differential gene expression by analysing array data from periodontitis patients and, second, to evaluate the anti-apoptotic effects of carvacrol, a monoterpenoid phenol, in vitro.A gene/protein interaction network model 'APOP' was developed by using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) version 9.05. Differential gene expression was determined by using the limma package from R and false discovery rate (FDR). With ViaComplex software, gene expression was plotted over the network. The anti-apoptotic effect of carvacrol was tested on sorbitol-treated HaCaT cells, by using a commercial kit for caspase-3 activity.The 'APOP' model characterised the landscape of interactions between apoptosis-related genes/proteins in silico. Forty-nine out of 70 genes from this model, such as CSF2RB, NFKBIE, ENDOG, CASP10 and CASP3, were differentially expressed (corrected p-value<0.05) in periodontitis samples when compared to those of healthy controls. In addition, carvacrol (0.43%) was able to inhibit the pro-apoptotic effects induced by sorbitol (0.3M), as seen by the reduction in caspase-3 activity on HaCaT cells.Our results suggest that caspase-3 can be a target protein to inhibit periodontitis-associated apoptosis of epithelial cells and that carvacrol has therapeutic potential as an anti-apoptotic agent.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631628","annotations":[{"name":"In silico","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_silico"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.83448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Phenol","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.796753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.764344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.568446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.359703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Sorbitol","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbitol"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.307573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Terpenoid","weight":0.304941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpenoid"},{"name":"Caspase 3","weight":0.272064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase_3"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"CASP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASP"},{"name":"Carvacrol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvacrol"},{"name":"Pythagorean limma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_limma"},{"name":"False discovery rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate"},{"name":"3M","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M"},{"name":"Caspase 10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase_10"},{"name":"NFKBIE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFKBIE"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Array data structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Franklin D.
