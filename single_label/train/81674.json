{"id":81674,"title":"The effect of adjunctive chlorhexidine mouthrinse on GCF MMP-8 and TIMP-1 levels in gingivitis: a randomized placebo-controlled study.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of adjunctive chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthrinse on gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) MMP-8 and TIMP-1 levels in plaque-associated gingivitis.A total of 50 gingivitis patients were included in the present study. In addition to daily plaque control, CHX group rinsed with CHX, while placebo group rinsed with placebo mouthrinse for 4 weeks. GCF samples were collected, and clinical parameters including plaque index, papillary bleeding index, calculus index and pocket depth were recorded at baseline and 4 weeks. GCF MMP-8 and TIMP-1 levels were determined by immunofluorometric assay (IFMA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively.In both groups, GCF MMP-8 levels of anterior and posterior sites at four weeks were not different from baseline (p?>?0.05). There were no significant differences in GCF MMP-8 levels between the study groups at four weeks (p?>?0.05). GCF TIMP-1 levels of anterior and posterior sites at four weeks were higher compared to baseline in both groups (p?<?0.05). There was no significant difference in GCF TIMP level between the study groups at four weeks (p?>?0.05).CHX usage had no significant effects on the GCF MMP-8 and TIMP-1 levels in plaque-associate gingivitis. However, daily plaque control resulted in the increase of GCF TIMP-1 levels regardless of CHX usage.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886536","annotations":[{"name":"Chlorhexidine","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorhexidine"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.704929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.593687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.368037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.102441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Gingival sulcus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_sulcus"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Adjunct (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_(grammar)"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Gingival and periodontal pocket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_and_periodontal_pocket"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Global Certification Forum","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Certification_Forum"},{"name":"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_inhibitor_of_metalloproteinases"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"}]}
