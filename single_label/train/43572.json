{"id":43572,"title":"Design and synthesis of novel 2-phenyl-5-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles as selective COX-2 inhibitors with potent anti-inflammatory activity.","abstract":"A novel series of 2-phenyl-5-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were designed and synthesized for selective COX-2 inhibition with potent anti-inflammatory activity. Among the compounds tested, 9g (2-(3-(4-nitrophenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole) was found to be the most potent inhibitor of COX-2 with IC50 of 0.31 ?M showing promising degree of anti-inflammatory activity in the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model with ED50 of 74.3 mg/kg. The lead compound 9g further showed suppression of acetic acid-induced writhes comparable to that of aspirin and gastro-sparing profile superior to the aspirin. Molecular docking analysis displayed higher binding affinity of ligands towards COX-2 than COX-1.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780593","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.837399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.823647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Phenyl group","weight":0.800857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenyl_group"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.679745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.621413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.607163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.5788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Lead compound","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_compound"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.41446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.344911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.119327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Docking (molecular)","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Effective dose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose"},{"name":"Oxadiazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxadiazole"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"234","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/234"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Paw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paw"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Biphenyl","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphenyl"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
