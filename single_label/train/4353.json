{"id":4353,"title":"[Protective effect of Fangyouling on Schistosoma japonicum infection].","abstract":"To evaluate the protective effect of Fangyouling (extracted from herb) on Schistosomajaponicum infection in the field.The residents in 2 villages, Zhaonao Village and Miaochang Village, were divided into Group A (139 persons) and Group B (162 persons), and the residents in Group A embrocated Fangyouling before their contacting the infested water and the residents in Group B did not. All the residents were investigated with questionnaires, and received the blood and stool examinations for schistosomiasis.The positive rates of blood tests were 3.13% and 9.34% in Group A and Group B respectively, the positive rates of stool examinations were 1.92% and 6.44% in Group A and Group B respectively (both P values < 0.05).Fangyouling has a good protective effect on S. japonicum infection.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434157","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.335458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.216096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Field (agriculture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(agriculture)"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.0104985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"}]}
