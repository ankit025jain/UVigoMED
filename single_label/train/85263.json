{"id":85263,"title":"The prevalence of OSA in snorers presenting with various chief complaints: a pilot study.","abstract":"The incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in snoring patients is reported in the literature to range from 20% to 70%. The aim of this study was to obtain exact data on the percent of snorers who have OSA, and to classify them as having normal, mild, moderate, or severe sleep apnea.There were 273 patients who came into the senior author's office with sleep disorder breathing problems. They suffered with various sleep problems. All 273 patients also had a snoring problem. None of the 273 patients had ever had a sleep test, or polysomnograph (PSG). All 273 required a PSG for evaluation of their sleep problem. They were referred to a certified sleep lab local to them. When the results of the PSG came back, the authors were able to classify them as having normal, mild, moderate, or severe sleep apnea.The results of the 273 PSGs showed the following: 12 patients (4%) had PSGs of apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)<5 (normal), 57 patients (21%) had PSGs with AHIs 5-<15 (mild), 79 patients (29%) had PSGs with AHIs 15-<30 (moderate), 119 patients (44%) had PSGs 30 or >30 (severe), and 6 patients (2%) had PSGs >100 (severe).Based on this study, of 273 patients who snored, the incidence of OSA is high. Ninety-six percent of the patients suffered with mild to severe sleep apnea. This malady, which can be very serious and degenerating, could be much more prevalent than previously believed. Additional research is needed to verify these figures.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000164","annotations":[{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.685027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Snoring","weight":0.491498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoring"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.361506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"1530","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1530"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Apnea-hypopnea index","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea-hypopnea_index"},{"name":"Paris Saint-Germain F.C.","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C."},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
