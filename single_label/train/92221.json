{"id":92221,"title":"[Imaging of the elbow joint with focused MRI. Part 1: examination techniques and sequences for bone and ligaments].","abstract":"Imaging of the elbow joint places high demands on the quality of imaging due to the challenging anatomy and the sometimes subtle findings. For the diagnosis of periarticular soft tissues, ligamentous structures and in individual cases for fracture and tumor diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is mostly groundbreaking and allows a reliable diagnosis in most cases. This review article discusses the complex imaging anatomy and anatomical variants of this joint and the most common osseous and ligamentous injuries of the elbow joint are presented. The typical MRI findings and indications are illustrated and discussed and possible pitfalls are pointed out. The various examination techniques and MRI sequences are also addressed.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435158","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.559079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.467599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.465174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.366214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Review article","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_article"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Groundbreaking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundbreaking"}]}
