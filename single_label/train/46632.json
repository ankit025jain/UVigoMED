{"id":46632,"title":"[Assessment of anaesthesia sufficiency and stress response during liver resections].","abstract":"Recently number of patients undergoing a surgery for primary and secondary liver damages is increased. Thus an adequate and safe anaesthesiological care for the surgeries is a very actual problem. The article deals with a study of anaesthesiological care in 51 patients. 26 patients (51%) received multimodal balanced anaesthesia based on sevoflurane and 25 patients (49%) received multimodal balanced anaesthesia based on continuous propofol infusion. Monitoring of haemodynamics, acid-base balance, common liquid volume, intracellular and extracellular liquid, stress hormones (cortisol and prolactin) was carried out during the surgeries. Haemodynamics and infusion and transfusion therapy were adequate during both methods of anaesthesiological care for liver resections. Strongly marked tissue injury during surgery causes neuroendocrine stress. Cortisol activity during anaesthesia based on continuous propofol infusion was less than during anaesthesia based on sevoflurane. This fact shows that propofol provides stronger protection than sevoflurane. Adequate level of anaesthesia does not cause outoregulative mechanisms suppression which is important during strongly traumatic surgery. Anaesthesia based on sevoflurane both to anaesthesia based on continuous propofol infusion is a method of choice for liver resection.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624852","annotations":[{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Cortisol","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.489611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.451083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.393059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.14988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Stress hormone","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_hormone"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Fight-or-flight response","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response"},{"name":"Sevoflurane","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevoflurane"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Balance (ability)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(ability)"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"United States customary units","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Sufficient statistic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_statistic"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"}]}
