{"id":26243,"title":"[Role of cardiac computed tomography in cardiac surgery].","abstract":"In the field of cardiovascular surgery, cardiac computed tomography (CT) has served an important role in association with the improvement of the spatial and temporal resolution. Because CT angiography (CTA) provides more available information than plain CT, CTA has been increasingly used to access the coronary arteries and graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Recently, minimally invasive cardiac surgeries, including CABG with left mini-thoracotomy and mitral valve surgery with right mini-thoracotomy, are revived, which requires preoperative CTA to make a strategy of incision placement on the basis of anatomical relationship between the target structure of the heart and the thorax. In Japan, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was approved in the late 2013, and is expected to be widely performed in the future. CTA is extremely useful for TAVI patients to determine the choice of the valve size and the surgical approach. CT provides many other valuable findings to us, but if we cannot fully leverage it in the daily cardiovascular surgery, its value is decreased. We have to acquire enough skill to maximize the performance of CT in the practical clinical setting.
