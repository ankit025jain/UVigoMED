{"id":42670,"title":"Open versus laparoscopic surgery for mid-rectal or low-rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (COREAN trial): survival outcomes of an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.","abstract":"Compared with open resection, laparoscopic resection of rectal cancers is associated with improved short-term outcomes, but high-level evidence showing similar long-term outcomes is scarce. We aimed to compare survival outcomes of laparoscopic surgery with open surgery for patients with mid-rectal or low-rectal cancer.We randomly assigned 340 patients to receive either open surgery (n=170) or laparoscopic surgery (n=170). 3 year disease-free survival was 72·5% (95% CI 65·0-78·6) for the open surgery group and 79·2% (72·3-84·6) for the laparoscopic surgery group, with a difference that was lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin (-6·7%, 95% CI -15·8 to 2·4; p<0·0001). 25 (15%) patients died in the open group and 20 (12%) died in the laparoscopic group. No deaths were treatment related.Our results show that laparoscopic resection for locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy provides similar outcomes for disease-free survival as open resection, thus justifying its use.National Cancer Center, South Korea.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837215","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.723718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.582083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.264037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.180839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"792","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/792"},{"name":"725","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/725"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
