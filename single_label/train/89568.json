{"id":89568,"title":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction practice patterns by NFL and NCAA football team physicians.","abstract":"This study aimed to determine practice patterns for National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I football team orthopaedic surgeons regarding management of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in elite, young, and middle-aged recreational athletes.Two hundred sixty-seven NFL and NCAA Division I team orthopaedic surgeons were surveyed through an online survey. A 9-question survey assessed surgeon experience, graft choice, femoral tunnel drilling access, number of graft bundles, and rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction.One hundred thirty-seven team orthopaedic surgeons (51%) responded (mean experience 16.75 ± 8.7 years). Surgeons performed 82 ± 50 ACL reconstructions in 2012. One hundred eighteen surgeons (86%) would use bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts to treat their starting running backs. Ninety (67%) surgeons drill the femoral tunnel through an accessory anteromedial portal (26% through a transtibial portal). Only 1 surgeon prefers a double-bundle to a single-bundle reconstruction. Seventy-seven (55.8%) surgeons recommend waiting at least 6 months before return to sport, whereas 17 (12.3%) wait at least 9 months. No surgeon recommends waiting 12 months or more before return to sport. Eighty-eight (64%) surgeons do not recommend a brace for their starting running backs during sport once they return to play.BPTB is the most frequently used graft for ACL reconstruction by NFL and NCAA Division I team physicians in their elite-level running backs. Nearly all surgeons always use a single-bundle technique, and most do not recommend a brace on return to sport in running backs. Return to sport most commonly occurs at least 6 months postoperatively, with some surgeons requiring a normal examination and normal return-to-sport testing (single leg hop).","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704069","annotations":[{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.902221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"National Football League","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"},{"name":"National Collegiate Athletic Association","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.703812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.689429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.648131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"College football","weight":0.641068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Division I (NCAA)","weight":0.460642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","weight":0.443581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_reconstruction"},{"name":"Running back","weight":0.321785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.270274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"The Football League","weight":0.209809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_League"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.174836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.119851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"USC Trojans football","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Hip hop music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Normal school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_school"},{"name":"Elite","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"}]}
