{"id":28469,"title":"[Drug interactions in emergency medicine].","abstract":"Drug interactions in emergency medicine can occur in many forms and can result in different complications. Drug interactions can be the primary cause for the emergency call, but also they can happen after the application of different drugs at the scene. Emergency physicians need to be aware of possible interactions of their own emergency drugs. Additionally, interactions of different medications prescribed by physicians, non-prescription drugs and also by food are possible. Emergency drugs should never be mixed in a single syringe or applied together in a single infusion bag. Solving of medications always needs to be in accordance with the official instruction leaflet.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863335","annotations":[{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Over-the-counter drug","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.568965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Syringe","weight":0.504562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.427496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Emergency telephone number","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Leaflet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaflet"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
