{"id":47063,"title":"[Expression and clinical significance of gastric dramatic down-related gene in gastric cancer and precancerous lesions].","abstract":"To investigate the expression and clinical significance of gastric dramatic down-related gene (GDDR) in gastric cancer and precancerous lesion tissues.Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of GDDR in 240 cases of gastric tissues, including 40 cases of normal gastric mucosa (NGM), 40 cases of chronic superficial gastritis (CSG), 40 cases of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), 40 cases of intestinal metaplasia (IM), 20 cases of mild dysplasia (MD), 20 cases of severe dysplasia (SD) and 40 cases of gastric cancer (GC).The mean rank order of GDDR were 190.70, 182.70, 146.24, 104.40, 70.33, 47.20 and 40.20 in NGM, CSG, CAG, IM, MD, SD and GC, respectively. The expression of GDDR significantly decreased in CAG, IM, MD, SD and GC as compared with normal controls and CSG (P<0.01).The gradually down-regulated expression of GDDR is an early molecular event in the development of gastric cancer. GDDR may play an important role in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer and may be utilized as a molecular diagnostic marker and a new target of anti-tumor molecular therapy in early stage of gastric cancer.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606753","annotations":[{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Metaplasia","weight":0.647192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaplasia"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.537759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.513739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.465789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.40368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.359808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Atrophic gastritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophic_gastritis"},{"name":"Intestinal metaplasia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_metaplasia"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
