{"id":45704,"title":"The safety of novel drugs used to treat irritable bowel syndrome.","abstract":"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder with a high prevalence. Besides efficacy, the safety of each drugs used to treat GI disorders is an important issue in the drug development process.This article reviews all Phase I to IV clinical trials or case reports with results related to the safety of novel GI drugs. The drugs are currently approved or under evaluation for approval.Most of the reported adverse events were related to the GI tract with mild-to-moderate severity. Diarrhea was significantly higher versus placebo following use of linaclotide and renzapride, similar to that of constipation with ramosetron. Lubiprostone, linaclotide and rifaximin with low systemic bioavailability have less adverse events and exert more advantageous results. Asimadoline acts peripherally on ?-opioid receptors and is not associated with CNS side effects. As lubiprostone and linaclotide cause dose-dependent adverse events, starting the treatment with the lowest effective doses is advised. Ramosetron is under evaluation for diarrhea-predominant IBS due to its acceptable safety and tolerability, besides its efficacy. Rifaximin, asimadoline and renzapride are still in need of more long-term studies regarding their safety.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669839","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Constipation","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.809475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.712922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.701041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.697567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Opioid receptor","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_receptor"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.598951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.546244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Renzapride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renzapride"},{"name":"Rifaximin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifaximin"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
