{"id":61594,"title":"Low expression of Abelson interactor-1 is linked to acquired drug resistance in Bcr-Abl-induced leukemia.","abstract":"The basis for persistence of leukemic stem cells in the bone marrow microenvironment remains poorly understood. We present evidence that signaling cross-talk between ?4 integrin and Abelson interactor-1 (Abi-1) is involved in the acquisition of an anchorage-dependent phenotype and drug resistance in Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia cells. Comparison of Abi-1 (ABI-1) and ?4 integrin (ITGA4) gene expression in relapsing Bcr-Abl-positive CD34+progenitor cells demonstrated a reduction in Abi-1 and an increase in ?4 integrin mRNA in the absence of Bcr-Abl mutations. This inverse correlation between Abi-1 and ?4 integrin expression, as well as linkage to elevated phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk signaling, was confirmed in imatinib mesylate -resistant leukemic cells. These results indicate that the ?4-Abi-1 signaling pathway may mediate acquisition of the drug-resistant phenotype of leukemic cells.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699303","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.817209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.400559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.336994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.251349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.130256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Crosstalk (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(biology)"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Persistent organic pollutant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_organic_pollutant"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"}]}
