{"id":76346,"title":"Genetic variants in CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and VDR modify the efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation for increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in a randomized controlled trial.","abstract":"Adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, [25(OH)D], are required for optimal bone health, and low levels are associated with chronic diseases.We investigated whether 41 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vitamin D and calcium pathway genes (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, VDR, and CASR) are associated with [25(OH)D] or modify the increase in [25(OH)D] from vitamin D3 supplementation.Baseline and year 1 [25(OH)D] measurements from a randomized controlled trial conducted at 11 clinical centers in the United States.A total of 1787 healthy non-Hispanic white participants aged 45-75 years.Vitamin D3 (1000 IU/d), calcium carbonate (1200 mg/d elemental), both, or placebo.Genotype main effects and interactions with vitamin D3 treatment estimated using multiple linear regression.The baseline serum [25(OH)D] was 25.4 ± 8.7 ng/mL (mean ± SD). Associations with baseline levels were discovered for SNPs in CYP24A1 (rs2209314, rs2762939) and confirmed for SNPs in GC and CYP2R1. After 1 year, [25(OH)D] increased on average by 6.1 ± 8.9 ng/mL on vitamin D3 treatment and decreased by 1.1 ± 8.4 ng/mL on placebo. The increase in [25(OH)D] due to vitamin D3 supplementation was modified by genotypes at rs10766197 near CYP2R1, rs6013897 near CYP24A1, and rs7968585 near VDR.The increase in [25(OH)D] attributable to vitamin D3 supplementation may vary according to common genetic differences in vitamin D 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1), 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes. These findings have implications for achieving optimal vitamin D status and potentially for vitamin D-related health outcomes.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070320","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.847232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.621785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.52066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Carbonate","weight":0.398527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.386404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.328679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Calcitriol receptor","weight":0.295022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol_receptor"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Calcium carbonate","weight":0.141923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate"},{"name":"Cholecalciferol","weight":0.114027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol"},{"name":"Hydroxylation","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25-Hydroxyvitamin_D3_1-alpha-hydroxylase"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Calcium-sensing receptor","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium-sensing_receptor"}]}
