{"id":45488,"title":"Factors influencing readmission after curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer.","abstract":"The incidence of, and associated risk factors for, readmission after potentially curative gastrectomy for patients with gastric cancer has not been well studied. We sought to determine the 30-day readmission rate as well as the potential risk factors for readmission at our institution in patients undergoing gastrectomy for gastric cancer with curative intent.We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing potentially curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer from 1995 to 2011. The 30-day hospital readmission rate was determined, and potential clinicopathologic risk factors for readmission were examined.Readmission to the hospital within 30 days occurred in 14.6% (61 of 418) of patients, including 6 patients who were readmitted more than once. The most common reasons for readmission included nutritional difficulties (n =12, 20%), intra-abdominal fluid collections (n = 11, 18%), and small bowel obstruction (n = 6, 10%). Factors associated with a higher 30-day readmission rate included type of resection (total gastrectomy, 23% vs subtotal gastrectomy, 13% vs esophagogastrectomy, 9%, p = 0.016), pre-existing cardiovascular disease (17%, p = 0.05), and history of a major postoperative complication (24%, p < 0.001). Factors not associated with a higher readmission rate included advanced age, pre-existing pulmonary disease, T or N stage, extent of lymph node dissection, receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, length of stay of the index hospitalization, and destination and level of support on discharge.Readmission after potentially curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer is common. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, those who suffer major postoperative complications, and those undergoing total gastric resections are at especially high risk for readmission, and strategies designed to support these high-risk patients on discharge are warranted.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680567","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.805151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.76972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.6638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.593378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.417045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.298924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.253892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0677463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"}]}
