{"id":63914,"title":"A patient with sarcoidosis who developed heterochronic involvements in different organs from initial organs during 7 years.","abstract":"A 59-year-old woman, who was given a diagnosis of sarcoidosis by supraclavicular lymph node biopsy 5 years previously, was admitted for further examination following abnormal radiologic findings. Nodular pulmonary and abdominal lesions were observed by computed tomography, and liver biopsy was performed and showed epithelioid cell granulomas. She was asymptomatic and was followed up with no therapy. At 1 year follow-up, the pulmonary and abdominal lesions had nearly complete resolution. Nodular pulmonary and abdominal lesions in patients with sarcoidosis can mimic metastatic disease, lymphoma, and infection, and can reappear during disease activity. Therefore, differential diagnosis and continual follow-up are important.
