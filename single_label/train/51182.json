{"id":51182,"title":"Empagliflozin for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Diabetes and its complications account for a significant healthcare burden. There is increasing prevalence of diabetes and newer drugs are being investigated to improve outcomes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) are a newer class of medications, which prevent renal reabsorption of glucose and hence help in glycaemic control without significant risk of hypoglycaemia. Two drugs, namely dapagliflozin and canagliflozin have gained approval and empagliflozin is one of the advanced agents of this class. Early trials with empagliflozin have shown a stable pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic effects with significant SGLT2 selectivity. Clinical trials have shown improvement in glycaemic control and other benefits including weight loss and lowering of blood pressure. Ongoing trials and surveillance will provide answers about cardiovascular benefits, risk of osteoporosis and cancer.
