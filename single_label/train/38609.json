{"id":38609,"title":"A new itch to scratch for TSLP.","abstract":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by allergic inflammation and itch. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a pro-allergic cytokine implicated in AD. A paper in Cell transforms the understanding of the functional repertoire of TSLP in general and in AD in particular showing that TSLP can directly stimulate sensory neurons and provoke itch.
