{"id":23075,"title":"Preoperative Clostridium difficile infection is not associated with an increased risk for the infection in ileal pouch patients.","abstract":"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) might contribute to a refractory course of pouchitis. However, the association between preoperative CDI and postoperative CDI in ileal pouch patients has not been investigated.Our study aimed to evaluate whether preoperative CDI had an impact on the occurrence of postoperative CDI in pouch patients.Consecutive eligible ileal pouch patients from February 2005 to December 2012 were identified from the Pouchitis Registry at the Cleveland Clinic. Patients in the registry with known status of CDI of the pouch were surveyed with a structured questionnaire regarding preoperative C. difficile test and its treatment. Medical records were also reviewed. Demographics and clinical characteristics and outcomes were evaluated with univariable and multivariable analyses.A total of 102 patients with preoperative C. difficile test were identified for this study and 21 patients (20.6%) tested positive for C. difficile test after colectomy. In logistic regression analysis, male patients were 7.85 (P = 0.003) times more likely to have CDI than women. In addition, preoperative significant comorbidities (P = 0.037) and preoperative use antibiotics for other indications (P = 0.005) were found to be associated with postoperative CDI of the pouch. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the preoperative CDI was associated with the occurrence of postoperative CDI (P = 0.769).Postoperative CDI occurred frequently in male patients with IPAA. In addition, preoperative comorbidities and antibiotic use were found to be risk factors for CDI of the pouch. However, preoperative CDI did not appear to be associated with an increased risk for postoperative CDI in pouch patients.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24504594","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.726777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.573002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.532101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.252368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.218084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Ileo-anal pouch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileo-anal_pouch"},{"name":"Pouchitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouchitis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Cleveland Clinic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Development_of_Indigenous_Peoples"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Cleveland","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"List of doping cases in sport","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_doping_cases_in_sport"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Bihar Legislative Assembly election, February 2005","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Legislative_Assembly_election,_February_2005"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"}]}
