{"id":72124,"title":"Annexin A1 in primary tumors promotes melanoma dissemination.","abstract":"Metastatic melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer and has a poor prognosis. We have previously identified Annexin A1 (ANXA1) as a potential murine melanoma-spreading factor that may modulate cell invasion by binding to formyl peptide receptors (FPRs). Here, we report that (1) in a B16Bl6 spontaneous metastasis model, a siRNA-induced decrease in tumoral ANXA1 expression significantly reduced tumoral MMP2 activity and number of lung metastases; (2) in a retrospective study of 61 patients, metastasis-free survival was inversely related to ANXA1 expression levels in primary tumors (HR 3.15 [1.03-9.69], p = 0.045); (3) in human melanoma cell lines, ANXA1 level was positively correlated with in vitro invasion capacity whereas normal melanocytes contained low ANXA1 levels, and (4) the ANXA1 N-terminal peptide ANXA12-26 stimulated MMP2 activity after interaction with FPRs and significantly stimulated the in vitro invasion of melanomas by acting on FPRs. These findings identify ANXA1 as a proinvasive protein in melanoma that holds promise as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target.","date":"2014-10-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997993","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.789135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.777825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.728598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Melanocyte","weight":0.683796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.610369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.402246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Aldehyde","weight":0.328957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.221984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Annexin A1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin_A1"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"}]}
