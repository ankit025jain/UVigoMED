{"id":66493,"title":"Behavioural profile and human adaptation of survivors after radical cystectomy and ileal conduit.","abstract":"There is a lack of good data in the literature evaluating the Health-Related Quality of Life (HR- QoL) in patients with urinary diversions. The aim of this study was to examine the changes in expectation and needs in terms of human adaptation and behavioural profiles in patients with ileal conduit (IC) after radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer (BC).A qualitative, multicenter cross-sectional study using a \"narrative based\" approach was planned. We proceed with a sampling reasoned choice (purposive), selecting groups of patients with follow-up from one up to more than 7 years after surgery. Data were collected through individual interviews.Thirty patients participated in the study. The processing of the interviews allowed us to identify 2 major profiles: positive and negative. Patients with a positive profile resumed normal daily activities with no or limited restrictions both on the personal and the social level. This profile reflects a good HR-QoL. The negative profile reflects the patients for whom the ostomy has meant a worsening of HR-QoL. A positive profile was statistically more frequent in older patients (p = 0.023), with a longer follow-up (p = 0.042) and less complications rates (p = 0.0002). According to the length of follow-up and the occurrence of complitations, we identified further 5 intermediate profiles.Patients' satisfaction is related to the degree of adaptation to their new life with an urinary stoma and its correct management. Live \"with urinary diversion\" represents a new phase of life and not a deterioration.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708662","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.466841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.134423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.134386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Narrative","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Stoma (medicine)","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Stoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma"},{"name":"Ileal conduit urinary diversion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileal_conduit_urinary_diversion"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Expected value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Catholic Church","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Human flu","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_flu"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Purpose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"},{"name":"Distraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Urinary diversion","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_diversion"}]}
