{"id":84310,"title":"Effect of gestational weight gain as well as rehabilitation training on postnatal pelvic muscle strength.","abstract":"The current study explored the impact of gestational weight gain on postnatal pelvic muscle strength and the effect of low-frequency electrical stimulation combined with biofeedback training on strength recovery.A total of 126 mothers six to eight weeks after term delivery were recruited at Peking University Shenzhen Hospital from August 2010 to July 2011. According to gestational weight gain, they were divided into two groups: the < 15 kg (A) and > or = 15 kg (B) groups. Pelvic floor muscle fibre strength was determined. Target low-frequency electrical stimulation combined with biofeedback training was conducted. After training, pelvic floor muscle fiber strength was determined again for effect evaluation.Before training, types I and II pelvic floor muscle fiber strength of group B was noticeably lower than that of group A (p < 0.05). After rehabilitation, the pelvic floor muscle strength of both groups significantly increased (p < 0.05). However, types I and II pelvic floor muscle fiber strength of group B was still significantly lower than that of group A (p < 0.05).Gestational weight gain negatively influences pelvic floor muscles. Low-frequency electrical stimulation combined with biofeedback training improves postnatal pelvic floor muscle fiber strength. A less gestational weight increase indicates faster postnatal pelvic muscle strength recovery and a better rehabilitative effect.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134284","annotations":[{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.640041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Biofeedback","weight":0.600162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.550058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.260134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.253725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Pelvic floor","weight":0.228312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_floor"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.189319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Peking University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University"},{"name":"Shenzhen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0177821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Functional electrical stimulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Operation Crossbow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossbow"},{"name":"Target Corporation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"}]}
