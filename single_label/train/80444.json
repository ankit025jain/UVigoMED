{"id":80444,"title":"Detachment of hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) from hunted sika deer (Cervus nippon).","abstract":"Ixodid ticks were collected from 13 sika deer, Cervus n.nippon, shot in the Boso Peninsula in central Japan from late February to early March 1999. Haemaphysalis megaspinosa was the most abundant species of the adults collected, although Haemaphysalis longicornis, H. flava, H. kitaokai, H. cornigera, Ixodes ovatus, and Amblyomma testudinarium were also collected. Males were more abundant than females for H. longicornis, H. megaspinosa, H. flava, and H. kitaokai. Ticks that had inserted their hypostome into its host skin (designated attached) were distinguished from those that were detached and on the host's surface. A greater fraction of males than females of all four species were detached. Females were classified in three feeding stages (engorged, partially engorged, and unfed). More H. longicornis and H. megaspinosa unfed female ticks than engorged and partially-engorged female ticks were collected detached. Our results indicated that H. megaspinosa, H. longicornis, H. flava, and H. kitaokai male ticks detached sooner than female ticks after their host died.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659518","annotations":[{"name":"Japan","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.406182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.384217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Sika Deer","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sika_Deer"},{"name":"Ixodidae","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodidae"},{"name":"Acari","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acari"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.0832637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"},{"name":"Hunting","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Hypostome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostome"},{"name":"Boso Peninsula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boso_Peninsula"},{"name":"Haemaphysalis longicornis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemaphysalis_longicornis"},{"name":"Haemaphysalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemaphysalis"},{"name":"Cervus","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervus"},{"name":"Ixodes","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Iberian Peninsula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Single-family detached home","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home"},{"name":"Four Species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Species"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Boso of Provence","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boso_of_Provence"},{"name":"Amblyomma","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyomma"},{"name":"Engorgement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engorgement"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
