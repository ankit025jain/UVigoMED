{"id":21534,"title":"Etiology, treatment, and reproductive prognosis of women with moderate-to-severe intrauterine adhesions.","abstract":"To analyze data from the hysteroscopic adhesiolysis of moderate-to-severe intrauterine adhesions (IUAs), and to review the disease etiology, changes in menstruation, uterine recovery, and reproductive prognosis of women after comprehensive therapy.In a retrospective descriptive analysis, clinical data were assessed from 683 patients with moderate-to-severe IUAs who were treated by hysteroscopic adhesiolysis at Third Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China, between January 2007 and December 2011. Patients underwent comprehensive treatment. After hysteroscopic adhesiolysis, a persistent balloon urinary catheter was inserted, together with an intrauterine device (IUD). Intrauterine sodium hyaluronate gel was injected to prevent adhesion reformation, and oral estrogen was administered to promote endometrial regeneration. The outcomes were menstrual changes and uterine recovery under hysteroscopy, and the reproductive prognosis of patients with fertility intentions.At the 3-month follow-up, the postoperative recovery of uterine shape was better than the recovery of menstruation among patients with moderate-to-severe IUAs. Among the 475 patients with fertility intentions, the pregnancy and live birth rates were 66.1% (314/475) and 64.0% (201/314), respectively.Comprehensive treatment prevented the recurrence of IUAs to a certain extent, but some severe endometrial injuries were found to be irreparable, reducing the rate of subsequent pregnancy and live birth.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598346","annotations":[{"name":"Hysteroscopy","weight":0.897172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteroscopy"},{"name":"Intrauterine device","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_device"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Urinary catheterization","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_catheterization"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Menstruation","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.783879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.77844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.675022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.647539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.616713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.536741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Birth rate","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Changsha","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changsha"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Protestant Reformation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation"},{"name":"Ovoviviparity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovoviviparity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
