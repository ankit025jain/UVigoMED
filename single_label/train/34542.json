{"id":34542,"title":"Clinical, neurophysiological and pathological findings of HNPP patients with 17p12 deletion: a single-centre experience.","abstract":"Classic clinical manifestations of HNPP are characterized by recurrent painless mononeuropathies, but a minority of patients present with an atypical clinical pattern, including CMT-like neuropathy, acute or chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy-like polyneuropathy, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Electrophysiological examination plays a central role in the diagnosis of HNPP, disclosing a non-uniform conduction slowing, more pronounced at entrapment sites.We report clinical, electrophysiological and pathological findings from 73 patients with HNPP, coming from 53 unrelated families, followed at our Institute of Neurology over a 20-year period.Typical presentation with recurrent multiple mononeuropathies was observed in 28/64 (44%) patients. In the remaining 36/64 (56%), we observed an atypical clinical presentation, characterized by generalized weakness and cramps, chronic ulnar neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic sensory polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barr√®-like presentation, and CMT-like presentation. Nine patients were asymptomatic for neuropathic symptoms. Nerve conduction studies showed in all cases a sensori-motor demyelinating polyneuropathy with conduction abnormalities preferentially localized at common entrapment sites. When performed, sural nerve biopsy disclosed the focal thickening of the myelin sheath in all patients.About half of the patients with HNPP from our cohort showed an atypical clinical presentation. Neurophysiological examination represents the main tool for a proper diagnosis.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726093","annotations":[{"name":"Nerve conduction study","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_study"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome"},{"name":"Myelin","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cramp","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramp"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.443471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.425994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Neurophysiology","weight":0.400137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Nerve compression syndrome","weight":0.229301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_compression_syndrome"},{"name":"Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy","weight":0.132081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_neuropathy_with_liability_to_pressure_palsy"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.1029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Sural nerve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sural_nerve"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Thickening agent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening_agent"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Carpal tunnel","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel"},{"name":"Piaget's theory of cognitive development","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget's_theory_of_cognitive_development"}]}
