{"id":1495,"title":"High risk of Internet addiction and its relationship with lifetime substance use, psychological and behavioral problems among 10(th) grade adolescents.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of higher risk of Internet addiction (HRIA) with lifetime substance use, psychological and behavioral factors among Turkish 10(th) grade students.Cross-sectional online self-report survey conducted in 45 schools from the 15 districts in Istanbul, Turkey. A representative sample of 4957 10(th) grade students was studied between October 2012 and December 2012. Other than sociodemographic variables the survey included the Addiction Profile Index Internet Addiction Form-Screening Version (BAPINT-SV) and the Psychological Screening Test for Adolescents (PSTA).The participants were classified into two groups as those with HRIA (15.96%) and those with lower risk of Internet addiction. The rate of HRIA was higher in the males. The findings indicated that HRIA is related with negative consequences in school, lifetime use of tobacco, alcohol and/or drug, suicidal thoughts, self-harming and delinquent behaviors.Male gender, lifetime use of tobacco, alcohol and/or drug, depression, attention deficit and hyperactivity symptoms and lack of assertiveness predicted the HRIA in Turkish 10(th) grade students. Being aware of those with HRIA is important in prevention and management of Internet addiction as well as other important problems among students, such as substance use.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377367","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.754147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.661254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.5491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.429401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Istanbul","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul"},{"name":"School","weight":0.357756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Juvenile delinquency","weight":0.354879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.323723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.289532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.222908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Internet addiction disorder","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder"},{"name":"Suicidal ideation","weight":0.186275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation"},{"name":"Assertiveness","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertiveness"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"ADHD predominantly inattentive","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD_predominantly_inattentive"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Tenth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_grade"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"}]}
