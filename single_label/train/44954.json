{"id":44954,"title":"Risk factors of post-ERCP pancreatitis at a tertiary referral center in Japan.","abstract":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has played a major role in the diagnosis of biliary and pancreatic diseases. The prevalence and mortality rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) remains a serious issue that needs to be resolved. Here, we report the first ERCP study that was conducted at a high-volume center of an educational institution in Japan.This study investigated patients with suspected biliary and pancreatic diseases who had undergone ERCP between April 2006 and June 2009. We created a database and analyzed preoperative and postoperative data. Patients who had undergone surgery and those with a history of undergoing duodenal papilla treatment were excluded.Mild (n=62) or moderate (n=3) pancreatitis was present in 65 cases (6.21%; 36 men and 29 women). A univariate analysis identified age under 50 years (P=0.01), pancreatography (P<0.001), and biliary stent placement (P<0.001). A Multivariate analysis was performed for evaluating the risk factors associated with PEP. This analysis identified age of the patients under 50 years [P=0.003; odds ratio (OR), 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.19-0.71], endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (P=0.012; OR, 4.69; 95% CI, 1.41-15.54), pancreatography (P<0.001; OR, 5.55; 95% CI, 2.98-10.33), and plastic stent placement (P<0.001; OR, 3.77; 95% CI, 2.17-6.54). Descriptive statistics showed that only pancreatography was associated with PEP. An additional sphincterotomy did not increase the risk of PEP (P=0.306; OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 0.52-7.84), and even adjusted for pancreatography.We changed the size of the stent to 7-Fr. In the future, we plan to repeat the same study with a higher number of cases.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710241","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.809279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.607103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.601194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.551338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.522162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.521335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.513614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.477115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.445754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.290373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Anal sphincterotomy","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sphincterotomy"}]}
