{"id":67786,"title":"[Conservative treatment in male urinary incontinence].","abstract":"Prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of urinary incontinence are well studied in women; however, studies on male urinary incontinence focus on incontinence following surgery of the bladder or prostate, predominantly incontinence after radical prostatectomy. Aging men suffer from incontinence, most frequently urge incontinence (overactive bladder, OAB), nearly as often as women do.The domain of conservative therapy of urinary stress incontinence in men is pelvic floor training. It remains unclear whether biofeedback procedures, electrostimulation therapy, or magnetic stimulation therapy can enhance pelvic floor training. There are data suggesting that an off-label therapy with DuloxetinÂ®, a selective serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI), improves urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy. Antimuscarinic agents in combination with bladder training have been proven as safe and effective treatment in men with OAB. Data, however, suggest that men with OAB are far less frequently treated than women.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585116","annotations":[{"name":"Biofeedback","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Pelvic floor","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_floor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.658353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.580921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Muscarinic antagonist","weight":0.56368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.473076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Overactive bladder","weight":0.472584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladder"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Stress incontinence","weight":0.0959829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_incontinence"},{"name":"Sexual stimulation","weight":0.0505576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_stimulation"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Electrotherapy","weight":0.0250317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrotherapy"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
