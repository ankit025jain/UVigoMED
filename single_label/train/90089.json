{"id":90089,"title":"Cervical spine injuries in suicidal hanging without a long-drop--patterns and possible underlying mechanisms of injury: an autopsy study.","abstract":"The incidence of cervical spine injuries in suicidal hangings with a short-drop has been reported to be extremely low or non-existent. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and pattern of cervical spine injuries in suicidal hanging.A retrospective autopsy study was performed and short-drop suicidal hanging cases with documented cervical spine injuries were identified. This group was further analyzed with regard to the gender and age of the deceased, the position of the ligature knot, the presence of hyoid-laryngeal fractures, and the level of cervical spine injury.Cervical spine injuries were present in 25 of the 766 cases, with an average age of 71.9 ± 10.7 years (range 39-88 years). In 16 of these 25 cases, the ligature knot was in the anterior position. The most common pattern of cervical spine injury included partial or complete disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament and widening of the lower cervical spine disk spaces, associated with absence of hyoid-laryngeal fractures.Cervical spine injuries are not commonly found in short-drop suicidal hanging, occurring in only 3.3 % of all observed cases. Cervical spine injury may be occurring in 80 % of subjects aged 66.5 years and above. The most common pattern of cervical spine injury included anterior longitudinal ligament disruption of the lower cervical spine, disk space widening, and no vertebral body displacement. These injuries were mainly associated with an anterior knot position, and may be a consequence of loop pressure to the posterior neck and cervical spine hyperextension.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652079","annotations":[{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Anterior longitudinal ligament","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_longitudinal_ligament"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.771361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.687542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.680341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.628037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.623765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.527217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.483018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.446443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hanging","weight":0.427526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.398053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Body of vertebra","weight":0.336262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_vertebra"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Strangling","weight":0.229536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.208041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.0366068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Suicide methods","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_methods"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"766","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/766"},{"name":"910","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/910"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Posterior triangle of the neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_triangle_of_the_neck"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
