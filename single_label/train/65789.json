{"id":65789,"title":"Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: 10 years of experience at a single institution.","abstract":"The Urological Clinic of the S. Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital, Bologna has been carrying out laparoscopic radical prostatectomy since 2002. In this study, we report the results after 10 years of LRP, analyzing in particular the oncological and functional aspects.Between March 2002 and August 2011, 400 patients underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Cancer control, recovery of continence and potency were evaluated at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. All data were retrospectively collected on the basis of thorough clinical and pathological examination.Follow-up ranged from 10 to 122 months. Pathological examination revealed pT2 and pT3 cancers in 63.5% and 36.5% of patients, respectively. The incidence of positive surgical margins and biochemical relapse rate was 33.8% and 12.0%, respectively.10 Years after the first laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was performed at our Center, we can state that it is a reliable alternative to traditional surgery, with satisfactory oncological and functional results.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778058","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.518766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.468416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.324076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.241807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.23589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.11565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Tesla (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)"},{"name":"Bologna","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Live action role-playing game","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"10 Years","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Years"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
