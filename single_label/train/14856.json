{"id":14856,"title":"Ivabradine (a hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel blocker) elevates the threshold for maximal electroshock-induced tonic seizures in mice.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ivabradine (a hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) blocker) on the threshold for maximal electroshock (MEST)-induced tonic seizures in mice.Electroconvulsionswere produced inmice by means of a current (sine-wave, 50Hz, maximum 500 V, strength from 3-10 mA, ear-clip electrodes, 0.2-s stimulus duration, tonic hindlimb extension taken as the endpoint).Ivabradine administered intraperitoneally (ip), 60 min before the MEST test, at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg, did not alter the threshold for maximal electroconvulsions in mice. In contrast, ivabradine at doses of 15 and 20 mg/kg significantly elevated the threshold for maximal electroconvulsions in mice (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). Linear regression analysis of ivabradine doses and their corresponding threshold increases allowed determination of the threshold increasing doses by 20 and 50% (TID20 and TID50 values) that elevate the threshold in drug-treated animals over the threshold in control animals. The experimentally derived TID20 and TID50 values for ivabradine were 8.70 and 18.29 mg/kg, respectively.Based on this preclinical study, one can ascertain that ivabradine dose-dependently increased the threshold for MEST-induced seizures, suggesting the antiseizure activity of the compound in this seizure model in mice.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399738","annotations":[{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sine wave","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave"},{"name":"Ampere","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.143256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Electroconvulsive therapy","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"MEST (Scientology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEST_(Scientology)"},{"name":"Ivabradine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivabradine"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Hydrogen cyanide","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"310","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/310"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Iproute2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2"},{"name":"Hindlimb","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindlimb"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_blocker"},{"name":"TID (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TID_(musician)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
