{"id":56756,"title":"Outcomes and complications of pneumatic retinopexy over a 12-year period.","abstract":"To evaluate anatomic and clinical outcomes of pneumatic retinopexy for treatment of primary retinal detachment.Noncomparative, single-center, consecutive, interventional case series evaluating all patients treated between 2000 and 2012. Patients with less than 1 month of follow-up or coexisting neovascular age-related macular degeneration, uveitis, endophthalmitis, or prior posterior segment surgery were excluded.Sixty-three eyes of 63 patients with primary retinal detachment treated with pneumatic retinopexy were included. Median follow-up was 10.3 months. Single-operation success (SOS), defined as anatomic reattachment with pneumatic retinopexy alone, occurred in 40 eyes (63%). The retina was successfully reattached in 21 of the other 23 eyes (91%) with one additional surgery. There was no difference in visual acuity outcomes between SOS and additional surgical intervention (P = .85). New or missed breaks were identified in 19 of 63 eyes (30%). Postoperative subretinal fluid was observed in 22 of 63 eyes (35%) and persisted at last follow-up in two of 63 eyes (3%). At final follow-up, the retina was fully attached in 97% of eyes.Pneumatic retinopexy remains a reasonably successful option in the management of primary retinal detachment. No difference in best corrected visual acuity outcomes in eyes achieving SOS versus those requiring additional surgery was demonstrated.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635154","annotations":[{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.875692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Endophthalmitis","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endophthalmitis"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.459411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Posterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.418847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.352692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.241649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Head transplant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_transplant"},{"name":"Pneumatics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Replantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replantation"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Outcome-based education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome-based_education"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"SOS","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS"}]}
