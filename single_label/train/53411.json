{"id":53411,"title":"Determining ProGRP and isoforms in lung and thyroid cancer patient samples: comparing an MS method with a routine clinical immunoassay.","abstract":"This paper compares two methods to determine the tumor marker progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP): as routine assay, the automated time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (TR-IFMA), which allows total ProGRP determination; and the immunocapture liquid chromatography selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-SRM-MS) method, which additionally allows isoform differentiation. The investigation included 60 serum samples from patients suffering from various cancer diseases which may cause elevated ProGRP levels (small cell lung carcinoma; SCLC, non-small cell lung carcinoma; NCLC; and medullary thyroid cancer; MTC, as well as some with unspecific diagnosis). The two methods showed good correlation (R (2)?=?0.887). However, the MS method determines the total ProGRP concentration systematically approximately 30 % lower than the TR-IFMA, implying that the absolute values generated by the methods are not interchangeable. The MS method gives additional information about isoform levels in the samples, providing novel insight into isoform expression on the protein level.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518900","annotations":[{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.784336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.700068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.665601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Small-cell carcinoma","weight":0.584962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.46606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.457152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.391803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.348154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Medullary thyroid cancer","weight":0.345403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.273939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.187945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Sample (material)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)"},{"name":"Synonym","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
