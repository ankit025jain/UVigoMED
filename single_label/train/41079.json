{"id":41079,"title":"Acute liver failure caused by severe acute hepatitis B: a case series from a multi-center investigation.","abstract":"Few data can be available regarding acute liver failure (ALF) caused by severe acute hepatitis B up to now. This study aims to report such cases from China.We conducted a multi-center investigation on ALF from 7 tertiary hospitals in different areas of China. A total of 11 patients with ALF caused by severe acute hepatitis B were finally identified. In these patients, there were 10 male and 1 female patients. As a serious complication, apparent hemorrhage occurred in 9 patients. Eventually, in these 11 patients, 4 survived and 7 died. 4 died of heavy bleeding, 2 died of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and 1 died of irreversible coma. No patients received liver transplantation.ALF caused by severe acute hepatitis B is worthy of formal studies based on its rarity and severity.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24958233","annotations":[{"name":"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.837189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.448729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
