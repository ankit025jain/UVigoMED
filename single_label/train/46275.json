{"id":46275,"title":"Cancer stem-like cells derived from chemoresistant tumors have a unique capacity to prime tumorigenic myeloid cells.","abstract":"Resistance to anticancer therapeutics greatly affects the phenotypic and functional properties of tumor cells, but how chemoresistance contributes to the tumorigenic activities of cancer stem-like cells remains unclear. In this study, we found that a characteristic of cancer stem-like cells from chemoresistant tumors (CSC-R) is the ability to produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and to generate M2-like immunoregulatory myeloid cells from CD14(+) monocytes. Furthermore, we identified the IFN-regulated transcription factor IRF5 as a CSC-R-specific factor critical for promoting M-CSF production and generating tumorigenic myeloid cells. Importantly, myeloid cells primed with IRF5(+) CSC-R facilitate the tumorigenic and stem cell activities of bulk tumors. Importantly, the activation of IRF5/M-CSF pathways in tumor cells were correlated with the number of tumor-associated CSF1 receptor(+) M2 macrophages in patients with non-small lung cancer. Collectively, our findings show how chemoresistance affects the properties of CSCs in their niche microenvironments.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24638980","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Macrophage colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Cerebrospinal fluid","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.771006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.659865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.614581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"CD14","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD14"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.530451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Myelocyte","weight":0.416305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelocyte"},{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.279322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Habitat","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Interferon regulatory factors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_regulatory_factors"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
