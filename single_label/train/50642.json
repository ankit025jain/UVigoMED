{"id":50642,"title":"Status of hypertension and coronary stenosis in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients: analysis from Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography Registry.","abstract":"Limited data exist regarding the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as clinical outcomes in asymptomatic diabetic patients with normotension, controlled hypertension, and uncontrolled hypertension.We enrolled 935 consecutive asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without known CAD. Coronary computed tomography angiography was used to evaluate the prevalence and severity of CAD. Blood pressure was measured at baseline. Patients were assigned to one of the three groups: normotension (n=314), controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP)< 140 mm Hg with treatment, n=458), or uncontrolled hypertension (SBP ? 140 mm Hg with or without treatment, n=163).Obstructive CAD (? 50% stenosis) increased from the prevalence in normotensive patients (33%) to that in patients with controlled (40%) or uncontrolled hypertension (52%) (p=0.003). The incidence of obstructive CAD in multivessel or left main CAD also increased across the three groups (13%, 21%, 32%, respectively, p<0.001). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that uncontrolled hypertension was an independent predictor of obstructive CAD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42 to 3.21, p<0.001). During a median follow-up of 3.1 years, uncontrolled hypertension was associated with increased risk of cardiac death or myocardial infarction compared to the risk in normotensive patients (hazard ratio, 6.11; 95% CI, 1.65 to 22.6, p=0.007).In asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients, uncontrolled hypertension was associated with increased risk of CAD and poor clinical outcomes.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767751","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial
