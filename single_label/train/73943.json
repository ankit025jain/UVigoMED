{"id":73943,"title":"Ganglioneuroblastoma of filum terminale: case report.","abstract":"Neuroblastic tumors can be classified as neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB), or ganglioneuroma. Ganglioneuroblastomas consist of small, round, immature neuroblast cells and matured ganglion cells. They are most commonly found in the mediastinum and retroperitoneum; intraspinal GNBs are extremely rare. There are only 5 cases of intraspinal GNB reported in the English literature. The authors report a case of GNB of the filum terminale. The duration of follow-up after the initial treatment is longer than in any other published reports.A 36-year-old woman underwent resection of an intradural extramedullary tumor at L1-2 in 1993. Pathological diagnosis was GNB. After surgery, her symptoms resolved and she recovered to a normal condition. In 2009, when she was 53 years old, she presented to the hospital with paralysis of both legs. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested recurrence of spinal tumor. She underwent subtotal resection of the tumors, followed by 4 weeks of radiation therapy.Neurological symptoms improved, and, after radiation therapy, the patient was able to walk with a crutch. Histological investigation of the excised tumor indicated that it was a nodular type GNB, which was consistent with the diagnosis from the time of the initial surgery in 1993. Follow-up MRI studies showed no growth of residual tumors in the 3 years following the surgery.The authors present a rare case of spinal GNB. The duration of follow-up after the initial surgery in 1993 represents the longest description of clinical course after treatment for spinal GNB.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878272","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.891737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.57223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Spinal tumor","weight":0.566864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_tumor"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.520412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.468221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.436727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Ganglion cell","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion_cell"},{"name":"Neuroblast","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblast"},{"name":"Ganglioneuroma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglioneuroma"},{"name":"English literature","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_literature"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"1993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"England","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Crutch","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crutch"}]}
