{"id":90027,"title":"Coccyx fractures treated with intranasal calcitonin.","abstract":"Treating pain associated with acute coccyx fractures can be challenging. Intranasal calcitonin has been used to treat acute pain after vertebral fracture, and may even accelerate fracture healing. However, intranasal calcitonin has never previously been published as part of the treatment of acute coccyx fractures.To examine a series of cases in which intranasal calcitonin was used to treat coccydynia related to coccyx fractures.Case series and literature review.Outpatient university-based coccyx pain center.After use of intranasal calcitonin, pain levels decreased, adverse events were minimal, and the medication was generally well tolerated.As this is not a randomized control trial, the patients treated with intranasal calcitonin were not compared to a control group. Additionally, the sample size of 8 patients is relatively small.We propose that clinicians consider use of intranasal calcitonin for the treatment of pain due to acute coccyx fractures.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658491","annotations":[{"name":"Calcitonin","weight":0.886812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.714106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Compression fracture","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_fracture"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.632167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.488665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coccydynia","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccydynia"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.459367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Coccyx","weight":0.440019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccyx"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.333835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.203234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Marion True","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_True"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"}]}
