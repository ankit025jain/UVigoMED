{"id":22103,"title":"[Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis caused prosthesis infection. Linezolid and rifampicin healed the complicated infection].","abstract":"Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, are common pathogens in orthopedic prosthesis infections. Operation and prolonged treatment with rifampicin in combination with another antibiotic is often required. Coagulase-negative Staph-ylococci are frequently multi-resistant, but resistance to vancomycin is rare in Sweden. Linezolid is an alternative, however it is only recommended for up to 4 weeks treatment due to risk of hematological side effects. We have successfully used prolonged treatment with linezolid and rifampicin in a patient suffering from a complicated prosthetic joint infection caused by a vancomycin resistant Staphyloccous epidermidis strain.
