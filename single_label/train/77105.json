{"id":77105,"title":"Vitamin A and dendritic cell differentiation.","abstract":"Vitamin A and its active metabolite retinoic acid are essential for the development and function of many tissues including the immune system. The induction of mucosal homing receptors on T and B cells by mucosal dendritic cells (DC) depends on the presence of vitamin A. Recent studies indicate that also the differentiation of CD11b+ DC subsets in the mucosa as well as the spleen depend on vitamin A signalling. As CD11b+ DC subsets exert non-redundant functions in anti-bacterial and anti-fungal immune responses, defects in CD11b+ DC differentiation will contribute to the clinical problems observed during vitamin A deficiency.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843870","annotations":[{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Retinoic acid","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoic_acid"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.771517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.719361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.620865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.547072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.218346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Integrin alpha M","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin_alpha_M"},{"name":"Vitamin A deficiency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A_deficiency"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Direct current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"}]}
