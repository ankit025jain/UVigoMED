{"id":72316,"title":"Phase II study of S-1 in combination with trastuzumab for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.","abstract":"We undertook a prospective phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of S-1 plus trastuzumab combination regimen for human epidermal-growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).HER2-positive MBC patients received oral administration of S-1 (80 mg/m2/day, days 1 to 28, every 6 weeks) and intravenous weekly trastuzumab (2 mg/kg), according to the results of a prior Phase I trial of our group.A total of 28 patients were enrolled and received a median of 3.5 (range 1-10) cycles of treatment. Overall response rate and clinical benefit rate were 53.6% and 75.0%, respectively. Progression-free survival was 30 weeks. With regard to grade 3 and 4 adverse effects, leucopenia, neutropenia, increase in serum alanine aminotransferase, and diarrhea were observed.Combination of S-1 and trastuzumab was tolerable and had excellent efficacy with good response and disease control in this trial.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982373","annotations":[{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.75928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.549876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.541972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.521772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.485294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.312947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Metastatic breast cancer","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_breast_cancer"}]}
