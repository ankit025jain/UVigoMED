{"id":73553,"title":"Interventional procedures of the spine.","abstract":"Different interventional procedures performed under imaging guidance permit the diagnosis and treatment of the many causes of back pain. Sources of pain amenable to be treated include facet joints, vertebral body, intervertebral disk, and paraspinal structures including nerves and ganglion roots. These procedures may be merely diagnostic, therapeutic, or intended for both purposes. We review the main indications, advantages, and complications of these techniques.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896746","annotations":[{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.649784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.630946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.233016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Zygapophysial joint","weight":0.127918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygapophysial_joint"},{"name":"Hard disk drive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Amenable group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenable_group"},{"name":"Image-guided radiation therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-guided_radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
