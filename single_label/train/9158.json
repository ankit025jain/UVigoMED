{"id":9158,"title":"Intranasal delivery of nanoparticles encapsulating BPI3V proteins induces an early humoral immune response in mice.","abstract":"Vaccine adjuvants are typically designed to stimulate both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Polymeric nanoparticles have been used as adjuvants in the development of vaccines against a number of viral pathogens and tested in laboratory animals. The objective of the study was to assess if synthetic bovine parainfluenza virus type-3 (BPI3V) peptide motifs and solubilised BPI3V proteins encapsulated in poly (dl-lactic-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) induce specific humoral immune responses in a mouse model following intranasal administration. BPI3V-specific and peptide specific IgG ELISAs were used to measure serum IgG levels to BPI3V. Intranasal delivery of PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating BPI3V proteins elicited an early, gradually increasing BPI3V-specific IgG response that persisted over the subsequent 6 weeks, suggesting slow, persistent release of antigen. PLGA-BPI3V particles administered intranasally induced a stronger IgG antibody response at an earlier time point compared with solubilised BPI3V antigen alone. Such an approach could be deployed in the development of new generation vaccines.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24726021","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.76635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.69548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Human parainfluenza viruses","weight":0.690441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_parainfluenza_viruses"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.510244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.494019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.464349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin domain","weight":0.45426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.434084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.415896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Nasal administration","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_administration"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.118274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Sequence motif","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif"},{"name":"Polyester","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
