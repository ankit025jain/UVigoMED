{"id":14792,"title":"Regression of atherosclerosis with anti-CD3 antibody via augmenting a regulatory T-cell response in mice.","abstract":"Although recent animal studies have investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the process of atherosclerosis regression, it remains unknown whether adaptive immune responses including T cells are involved in this process. We investigated the role of T cells in atherosclerosis regression.LDL receptor-deficient mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks to form atherosclerotic lesions and were then changed to a standard diet, and atherosclerosis was assessed 4 weeks later. Just before changing the diet, the mice received an iv injection of anti-CD3 antibody (CD3-Ab) or control immunoglobulin G for 5 consecutive days. CD3-Ab treatment regressed atherosclerosis and decreased the accumulation of macrophages and CD4(+) T cells in the plaques. CD3-Ab treatment also dramatically reduced CD4(+) T cells and increased the proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Depletion of Tregs by anti-CD25 antibody injection abolished the regression of atherosclerosis seen in CD3-Ab-treated mice, indicating the essential role for Tregs in this process.CD3-Ab treatment induced rapid regression of established atherosclerosis via reducing CD4(+) T cells and increasing the proportion of Tregs. These findings suggest that therapeutic intervention for T-cell-mediated immune responses may represent a novel strategy to induce atherosclerosis regression in combination with lipid-lowering therapy.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403315","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.833959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.724192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.718219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.673047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.646971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.589042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.492364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.32408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.108903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"}]}
