{"id":76890,"title":"Relationship between the percentage of body fat and surrogate indices of fatness in male and female Polish active and sedentary students.","abstract":"Limited data have indicated that body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) of athletes and young adults provide misleading results concerning body fat content. This study was aimed at the evaluation of the relationship between different surrogate indices of fatness (BMI, WC, WHR, WHtR and body adiposity index (BAI)) with the percentage of body fat in Polish students with respect to their sex and physical activity.A total of 272 students volunteered to participate in the study. Of these students, 177 physical education students (90 males and 87 females) were accepted as active (physical activity of 7 to 9 hours/week); and 95 students of other specializations (49 males and 46 females) were accepted as sedentary (physical activity of 1.5 hours/week). Weight, height, waist and hip circumferences were measured, and BMI, WHR, WHtR and BAI were calculated. Body fat percentage was assessed using four skinfold measurements.Classification of fatness according to the BMI and the percentage of body fat have indicated that BMI overestimates fatness in lean subjects (active men and women, sedentary men), but underestimates body fat in obese subjects (sedentary women). In all groups, BMI, WHR, WHtR and BAI were significantly correlated with the percentage of body fat (with the exception of WHR and hip circumference in active and sedentary women, respectively). However, coefficients of determination not exceeding 50% and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients lower than 0.9 indicated no relationship between measured and calculated body fat.The findings in the present study support the concept that irrespective of physical activity and sex none of the calculated indices of fatness are useful in the determination of body fat in young adults. Thus, it seems that easily calculated indices may contribute to distorted body image and unhealthy dietary habits observed in many young adults in Western countries, but also in female athletes.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24887103","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Body fat percentage","weight":0.857616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage"},{"name":"Body image","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Waist-hip ratio","weight":0.794359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist-hip_ratio"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.697376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.64329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.510775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.482719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.37766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.35538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.342048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.33035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.282524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.224464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Physical education","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Waistline (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waistline_(clothing)"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
