{"id":82880,"title":"The use of bisphosphonates in children: review of the literature and guidelines for dental management.","abstract":"Bisphosphonates are inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption with therapeutic benefit in a variety of bone disorders in both adults and children. While these agents have been routinely used in adults for the past three decades, their more recent introduction into paediatric medicine means there is a paucity of data on long-term safety and effects on dental development. There is uncertainty regarding the dental management of children treated with bisphosphonates, particularly when invasive dental procedures, such as extractions and oral surgical procedures, are required. There are limited data with which to make recommendations about the dental management of patients treated with bisphosphonates, and there are no published recommendations that specifically address paediatric patients. This paper aims to outline paediatric uses and adverse effects of bisphosphonates and present recommendations on the dental management of children receiving bisphosphonates.
