{"id":66677,"title":"Sperm deoxyribonucleic acid damage in normozoospermic men is related to age and sperm progressive motility.","abstract":"To evaluate sperm DNA fragmentation in normozoospermic male partners of couples undergoing infertility evaluation.Retrospective cohort study.Clinical andrology laboratory.A total of 1,974 consecutive normozoospermic men selected from a larger cohort of 4,345 consecutive, nonazoospermic men presenting for infertility evaluation.None.Clinical parameters, conventional semen parameters, and sperm DNA fragmentation assessed by flow cytometry-based TUNEL assay and reported as percent sperm DNA fragmentation (%SDF).The mean (± SD) %SDF and the proportion of men with high %SDF (>30%) were significantly lower in the normozoospermic compared with the entire cohort of 4,345 evaluable infertile men (17.6% ± 10.1% vs. 20.7% ± 12.4% and 11% vs. 20%, respectively). In the group of 1,974 normozoospermic men, %SDF was positively correlated with paternal age (r = 0.17) and inversely correlated with progressive motility (r = -0.26). In the subset of normozoospermic men with sperm parameters above the 50th percentile (? 73 × 10(6) sperm/mL, ? 55% progressive motility, and ? 14% normal forms, World Health Organization 2010 guidelines), 5% (4 of 83) had elevated %SDF (>30%).In this large cohort of normozoospermic men presenting for infertility evaluation, DNA fragmentation level is related to sperm motility and paternal age, and 11% of these men have high levels of sperm DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, the data indicate that a nonnegligible proportion (5%) of normozoospermic men with high-normal sperm parameters may also have significant sperm DNA fragmentation.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690240","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.644407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.588142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.231282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"TUNEL assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUNEL_assay"},{"name":"Sperm motility","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_motility"},{"name":"DNA fragmentation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_fragmentation"},{"name":"Percentile","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"},{"name":"Andrology","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrology"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.0179886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"345","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/345"},{"name":"974","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/974"},{"name":"Natural deduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Paternal age effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternal_age_effect"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Father","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
