{"id":63500,"title":"Alternative BRAF mutations in BRAF V600E-negative hairy cell leukaemias.","abstract":"The BRAF V600E mutation in exon 15 is considered the disease-defining mutation in hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), but single HCL cases lacking this mutation have been described. In 24 HCL, as well as in 194 various mature B- and T-cell neoplasms, we extended the search for BRAF mutations to exon 11. Two V600E-negative HCL contained novel, potentially functionally relevant mutations in exon 11 (F468C and D449E), while one other HCL was BRAF wild-type in exons 2-17. All non-HCL lymphomas lacked BRAF mutations. We therefore suggest screening of BRAF V600E-negative HCL for alternative exon 11 mutations in the diagnostic setting.
