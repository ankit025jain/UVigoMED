{"id":90176,"title":"Combat trauma-associated invasive fungal wound infections: epidemiology and clinical classification.","abstract":"The emergence of invasive fungal wound infections (IFIs) in combat casualties led to development of a combat trauma-specific IFI case definition and classification. Prospective data were collected from 1133 US military personnel injured in Afghanistan (June 2009-August 2011). The IFI rates ranged from 0·2% to 11·7% among ward and intensive care unit admissions, respectively (6·8% overall). Seventy-seven IFI cases were classified as proven/probable (n = 54) and possible/unclassifiable (n = 23) and compared in a case-case analysis. There was no difference in clinical characteristics between the proven/probable and possible/unclassifiable cases. Possible IFI cases had shorter time to diagnosis (P = 0·02) and initiation of antifungal therapy (P = 0·05) and fewer operative visits (P = 0·002) compared to proven/probable cases, but clinical outcomes were similar between the groups. Although the trauma-related IFI classification scheme did not provide prognostic information, it is an effective tool for clinical and epidemiological surveillance and research.","date":"2014-12-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642013","annotations":[{"name":"Afghanistan","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.686781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.620917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.526686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.459993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.377409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.356942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.288387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.233016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.223431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"United States Armed Forces","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Epidemiological surveillance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological_surveillance"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"1133","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1133"},{"name":"Cellular automaton","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton"},{"name":"International financial institutions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_financial_institutions"},{"name":"Military unit","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_unit"},{"name":"IFI","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFI"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"}]}
