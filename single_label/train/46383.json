{"id":46383,"title":"Is BCLC algorithm useful in clinical practice? Study on 164 HCC patients.","abstract":"The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification has been recently validated as the best system for treatment guidance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the usefulness of BCLC in the treatment of HCC comparing our treatment decision and the BCLC algorithm indications.In 102 patients affected by HCC observed from 1991 to 2002 a retrospective analysis was performed. The choice of treatment was compared with the treatment schedule proposed by BCLC. Whereas the second group of 62 patients observed from 2008 to 2010 was analysed both retrospectively in comparison with the BCLC classification.We found a disagreement in between our decision making and the choices suggested by BCLC. We only found a statistical significance for age and performance status test. In surgical patients the median age and the PST class were lower with a statistically significant p value (0.04 and 0.03, respectively).The BCLC system would not have changed our decision either in the past, or in present days, especially in surgical indications. Even if the decision making is affected by BCLC, actually that process still needs the support of the experience of each clinical centre involved.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634945","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.861326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.671254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.617733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.612941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.507291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Barcelona","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
