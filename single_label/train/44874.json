{"id":44874,"title":"Rescue therapy with intravenous silibinin in liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV hepatitis - two case reports.","abstract":"Recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation is inevitable and decreases survival. Graft loss due to recurrent HCV occurs in 25% to 30% of patients. The recommended AASLD treatment is PEG-IFN, with or without ribavirin, but some patients might be not eligible for this treatment. An alternative antiviral agent is silibinin (SIL). In vitro silibinin stops replication, probably by inhibiting HCV RNA polymerase.We present the cases of 2 patients with severe recurrent HCV infection who received intravenous silibinin (IV SIL) as a \"rescue therapy\". In the first patient with cholestatic fibrosing hepatitis, HCV RNA became undetectable. We also noted significant viremia reduction, and improvement in laboratory results and clinical presentation in the second patient.Administration of IV SIL resulted in a rapid decrease of HCV viremia. In post-transplant patients with HCV recurrence who are not eligible for standard antiviral treatment, IV SIL can be considered as an alternative, but further investigations are necessary to establish treatment protocols.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714452","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.796038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.796007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"RNA polymerase","weight":0.777672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Silibinin","weight":0.734118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silibinin"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.725258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cholestasis","weight":0.527743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestasis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.415946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.354805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.258737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.228859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.134341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
