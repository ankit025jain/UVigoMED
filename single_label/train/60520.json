{"id":60520,"title":"A torted wandering spleen: a case report.","abstract":"A torted wandering spleen is a rare clinical occurrence with fewer than 500 cases reported and an incidence of less than 0.2%. It is brought about through laxity of the gastrosplenic and splenorenal ligaments; however, the precise aetiology remains unknown. It can prove to be a diagnostic challenge with high mortality if misdiagnosed.We present the case of a 27-year-old woman of Arabic ethnicity, who complained of a short history of severe abdominal pain with the background of recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting. An abdominal computerized tomography scan revealed a torted wandering spleen. This required a splenectomy due to splenic infarction.This report highlights the investigations and management necessary for a patient who presents with an ischaemic torted wandering spleen.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886115","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.707463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.64799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.499803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.463746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Splenectomy","weight":0.343911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenectomy"},{"name":"Arabic language","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.259122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Splenic infarction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenic_infarction"},{"name":"Wandering spleen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_spleen"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
