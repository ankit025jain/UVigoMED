{"id":80071,"title":"[Research priorities for the control and elimination of major helminthiases].","abstract":"In 2009, the Disease Reference Group on Helminth Infections (DRG4) was established by the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) to comprehensively review recent advances, identify gaps and rank priorities in helminthiases research towards control and elimination. Six major human helminthiases are targeted, namely onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases, schistosomiasis, food-borne trematodiasis and cysticercosis/taeniasis. Systematic reports made by the DRG4 from such aspects as the impact of helminthiases, control and elimination, interventions, diagnostics, social-ecology and health systems, modeling, basic research and capacity building in research was published in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases in 2012. Generalized introduction is presented here and further analysis of its influence on the research of the major helminthiases in China is done.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809202","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"China","weight":0.730789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.710488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Filariasis","weight":0.629691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filariasis"},{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.622028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.562623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Onchocerciasis","weight":0.462222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onchocerciasis"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Tropical disease","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_disease"},{"name":"Neglected diseases","weight":0.278001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglected_diseases"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.169122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Helminthiasis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthiasis"},{"name":"Public Library of Science","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Library_of_Science"},{"name":"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLoS_Neglected_Tropical_Diseases"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Tropical medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_medicine"},{"name":"Pure research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_research"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Capacity building","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_building"}]}
