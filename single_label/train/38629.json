{"id":38629,"title":"[Factors associated with the survival of very low birth weight neonates at the Yaounde gynaeco-obstetric and pediatric hospital, Cameroon].","abstract":"The rate of survival of very low birth weight neonates (less than 1500 g) is still low in most developing countries, such as Cameroon. The aim of this study was to assess the maternal and neonatal factors that can influence the survival of neonates with birth weights under 1500 g.This was a retrospective, descriptive, and analytic study of 397 neonates weighing less than 1500 g who were admitted to the Yaounde gynaeco-obstetric and pediatric hospital from May 2003 to December 2011. The chi-squared test and the odds ratio were used to identify risk factors for death. The threshold of significance was P<0.05.The overall survival rate was 26.5%. The main comorbidities were prematurity (99%), neonatal sepsis (36%), and intrauterine growth retardation (27.2%). The factors that statistically influenced outcome were: parity, birth weight, gestational age, the 5th-min Apgar score, advanced resuscitation at birth, and respiratory distress.The survival of neonates weighing less than 1500 g depends on several factors, which if acted upon could improve the survival rate.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411568","annotations":[{"name":"Apgar score","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Intrauterine growth restriction","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.8079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Low birth weight","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.608674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.603184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.374145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.217447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","weight":0.170686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cameroon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Parity (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(biology)"},{"name":"Children's hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_hospital"}]}
