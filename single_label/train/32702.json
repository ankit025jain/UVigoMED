{"id":32702,"title":"Epilepsies associated with focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs).","abstract":"Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are increasingly recognized as one of the most common causes of pharmaco-resistant epilepsies. FCDs were recently divided into various clinico-pathological subtypes due to distinct imaging, electrophysiological, and outcome characteristics. In this review, we will overview the international consensus classification of FCDs in light of more recently reported clinical, electrical, imaging and functional observations, and will also address areas of ongoing debate. In addition, we will summarize our current knowledge on pathobiology and epileptogenicity of FCDs as well as its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. The clinical (electroencephalographic, imaging, and functional) characteristics of major FCD subtypes and their implications on the presurgical evaluation and surgical management will be discussed in light of studies describing these characteristics and postoperative seizure outcomes in patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy due to histopathologically confirmed FCDs.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916270","annotations":[{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.854429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.784165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.639073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.538571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.518062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.435876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.424505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.398154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.37066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Nintendo Entertainment System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
