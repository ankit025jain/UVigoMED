{"id":18491,"title":"Completeness and timeliness of electronic vs. conventional laboratory reporting for communicable disease surveillance--Oklahoma, 2011.","abstract":"The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act encourages the meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology. A HITECH-compliant core component is nationwide electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) implementation for communicable disease surveillance. In Oklahoma, laboratories with ?400 positive tests/year for reportable diseases must use ELR. Of 18 such laboratories, two have adopted ELR. We compared completeness and timeliness of ELR reports from these two laboratories with conventional reports from all other Oklahoma laboratories.We retrospectively reviewed confirmed reportable disease cases for January 1-December 31, 2011, excluding tuberculosis, hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections, diseases without laboratory diagnoses, and immediately reportable diseases. Probable reportable tickborne disease cases were included. We compared ELR with conventional reporting (i.e., mail, fax, telephone, and Internet). We assessed data completeness based on eight demographic and two laboratory fields in each disease report and timeliness by percentage of cases reported in ?1 business day.Overall, 1,867 reports met the inclusion criteria; 24% of these reports had been submitted by ELR. Data completeness was 90% for ELR and 95% for conventional reporting. Patient addresses accounted for 97% of the missing data fields for ELR reports. Timeliness was 91% for ELR and 87% for conventional reports.Although early in the transition to ELR compliance in Oklahoma, ELR has already yielded improved timeliness for communicable disease surveillance. However, ELR did not yield more complete reports than conventional reporting. Requiring specific demographic data fields for ELR reports can improve the completeness of ELR.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791024","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.935439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Sexually transmitted disease","weight":0.755309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Disease surveillance","weight":0.644952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_surveillance"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.634145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Information technology","weight":0.593393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.526543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Oklahoma","weight":0.520158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.389381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Electronic health record","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.296238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.28735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act"},{"name":"Fax","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.153892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mail","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Tick-borne disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick-borne_disease"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Regulatory compliance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Transition economy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_economy"},{"name":"Health information technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_information_technology"}]}
