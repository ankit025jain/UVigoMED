{"id":53883,"title":"[Regulatory effects and associated mechanisms of miR-130a molecules on cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer A2780 cell lines].","abstract":"To determine the regulatory effects and associated mechanisms of miR-130a on cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer A2780 cell lines (including cisplatin sensitive A2780s and its resistant A2780/DDP cells).A2780s and A2780/DDP cells were divided into four groups, and treated with lipo2000 (Lip), miR-negative (miR-NC) control, miR-130a-mimics (miR-130a-M increasing the expression of miR-130a and the agent), and miR-130a-inhibitor (miR-130a-I downregulating miR-130a expression), respectively. The proliferation of cells and their sensitivity to cisplatin were detected by MTT assay. RT-PCR and western blot were performed to examine the levels of MDR1, PTEN mRNA and proteins.The expressions of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp in the A2780/DDP cells were significantly higher than those in the A2780s cells. However, no differences in the expressions of PTEN mRNA and proteins were detected between the two cell lines. Over-expressions of miR-130a had no effect on cell proliferation, but increased the resistance of the cells to cisplatin and up-regulated the expressions of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp in both cell lines. Down-regulated miR-130a did not affect cell proliferations, but enhanced the sensitivity of the cells to cisplatin, inhibited the expressions of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp and increased the expression of PTEN proteins.MiR-130a expression may be associated with cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer cells. MiR-130a inhibitor can reverse the cisplatin resistance by upregulating the expression of PTEN proteins and down-regulating P-gp in A2780 cell lines. MiR-130 may become a new potential target of genetic therapy for cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancers.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490491","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.782792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.710647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.651713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.596924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.503133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.414705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.343158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.225046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
