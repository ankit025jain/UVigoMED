{"id":10897,"title":"A new experimental model of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in Wistar rats.","abstract":"To describe a new murine model of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema.Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: the cigarette smoke group, comprising 12 rats exposed to smoke from 12 commercial filter cigarettes three times a day (a total of 36 cigarettes per day) every day for 30 weeks; and the control group, comprising 12 rats exposed to room air three times a day every day for 30 weeks. Lung function was assessed by mechanical ventilation, and emphysema was morphometrically assessed by measurement of the mean linear intercept (Lm).The mean weight gain was significantly (approximately ten times) lower in the cigarette smoke group than in the control group. The Lm was 25.0% higher in the cigarette smoke group. There was a trend toward worsening of lung function parameters in the cigarette smoke group.The new murine model of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema and the methodology employed in the present study are effective and reproducible, representing a promising and economically viable option for use in studies investigating the pathophysiology of and therapeutic approaches to COPD.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626269","annotations":[{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.778221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.578124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Emphysema","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.413135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.381649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.32701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.103201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"List of cigarette smoke carcinogens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cigarette_smoke_carcinogens"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Maltese lira","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_lira"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
