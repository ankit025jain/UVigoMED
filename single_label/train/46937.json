{"id":46937,"title":"Indocyanine green fluorescence-guided sentinel node biopsy: a meta-analysis on detection rate and diagnostic performance.","abstract":"Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-guided sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) has been successfully employed in various kinds of tumors. Clinical results of previous studies on this technique are at different levels of evidence. This Meta-analysis was conducted to provide a more precise estimation on its clinical performance.Eligible studies were identified from systematical PubMed and EMBASE searches; data were extracted. A Meta-analysis was performed to generate pooled detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operator characteristic curves.Fifteen published articles were included. Clinical data of 513 patients were obtained. The pooled detection rate, the pooled sensitivity, the pooled specificity, the pooled DOR and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were 0.96 (0.91-0.99), 0.87 (0.79-0.92), 1.00 (0.99-1.00) and 150.13 (57.42-392.56), respectively. Significant heterogeneities existed among studies. Significant publication bias was found in detection rate. The concentration < 5 mg/ml subgroup and the injected volume ?2 ml subgroup had higher DORs, sensitivities and detection rates than the concentration ? 5 mg/ml subgroup and the injected volume <2 ml subgroup, respectively.Based on this Meta-analysis, this technique could be valued promising for detecting the presence of LN metastases. ICG injection with reduced concentration and larger volume may provide improved performance.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613744","annotations":[{"name":"Publication bias","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.662376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.359055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.219691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.162483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Indocyanine green","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indocyanine_green"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/991"},{"name":"790","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/790"},{"name":"910","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/910"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Lega Nord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord"},{"name":"Method of characteristics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_characteristics"},{"name":"Icelandic Coast Guard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Coast_Guard"},{"name":"Clinical governance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_governance"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Sentinel node","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_node"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Indian independence movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"}]}
