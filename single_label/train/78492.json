{"id":78492,"title":"Flexible carbon dioxide laser-assisted endoscopic marsupialization and ablation of a laryngeal saccular cyst in a neonate.","abstract":"To report the occurrence of a neonate with a lateral saccular cyst that was successfully managed by flexible, carbon dioxide laser-assisted endoscopic marsupialization and ablation.A full-term, 14-day-old girl presented to the clinic for progressively worsening stridor since birth. On fiber optic laryngoscopy, she was found to have a large, right saccular cyst obstructing the laryngeal inlet. The patient was admitted and underwent microlaryngeal endoscopic CO2 laser marsupialization and ablation of the saccular cyst. She was observed overnight and was discharged without complication the next day. At that time, stridor was no longer present and she remained symptom free at both her 2-week and 3-month follow-up.The congenital saccular cyst is a rare, abnormal dilation of the laryngeal saccule that is known to be a cause of airway obstruction. A variety of contrasting treatment strategies for laryngeal saccular cysts in children have been reported in the literature. Determining the definitive treatment modality thus remains a challenge that is compounded further by the rarity of the lesion.We introduce a new surgical technique that employs a 30-degree angled telescope with a flexible laser fiber system that provides excellent visualization of saccular cysts, in particular, lateral lesions that are less visible using line-of-sight technology.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646753","annotations":[{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.795465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.77631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.717489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Stridor","weight":0.665744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridor"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.530951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.489231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.344597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.305384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.280682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Airway obstruction","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Telescope","weight":0.119278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide laser","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Marsupialization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupialization"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
