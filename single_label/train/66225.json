{"id":66225,"title":"Active sacral neuromodulator during pregnancy: a unique case report.","abstract":"Sacral neuromodulation with an implanted device is used in patients who experience urinary retention and malfunctioning overactive bladder where conservative treatment is not sufficient. The knowledge of its effect on pregnancy is not known. This article presents the case of a 34-year-old pregnant woman with an implanted device, the use of which was not discontinued during her pregnancy. Full-term pregnancy was achieved, and a healthy child was delivered by cesarean section. Sacral neuromodulation during pregnancy appears to be safe and may be preferable to intermittent bladder catheterizations that increase the chance of urinary infections.
