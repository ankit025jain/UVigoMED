{"id":43220,"title":"miR-17-5p promotes proliferation by targeting SOCS6 in gastric cancer cells.","abstract":"This study aimed to test the exact functions and potential mechanisms of miR-17-5p in gastric cancer. Using real-time PCR, miR-17-5p was found to be expressed more highly in gastric cancer compared with-normal tissues. Gain- and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-17-5p increased the proliferation and growth of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Through reporter gene and western blot assays, SOCS6 was shown to be a direct target of miR-17-5p, and proliferative assays confirmed that SOCS6 exerted opposing function to that of miR-17-5p in gastric cancer. In short, miR-17-5p might function as a pro-proliferative factor by repressing SOCS6 in gastric cancer.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24801601","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Reporter gene","weight":0.817506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter_gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.694493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.446767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.260134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain"},{"name":"Reporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter"},{"name":"Suppressor of cytokine signalling","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor_of_cytokine_signalling"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
