{"id":90024,"title":"Flexor carpi radialis tendon ultrasound pictorial essay.","abstract":"Disorders of the flexor carpi radialis tendon (FCRt) are often missed even though they are a relatively frequent cause of volar radial wrist pain. They can manifest as tenosynovitis, tendinopathy, synovial sheath cysts with or without scaphoid-trapezoid-trapezium (STT) joint pathology, and partial or complete rupture. Because FCRt disorders often present with non-specific symptoms and a non-diagnostic clinical examination, imaging is often necessary for accurate evaluation and therapeutic planning. Conventional radiography provides good visualization of the neighboring bones and joints, as well as rare intratendinous calcifications. MRI enables evaluation of the FCRt and adjacent anatomical structures with excellent tissue resolution. In comparison, ultrasound (US) evaluation of the FCRt is less commonly described in the radiology literature, despite its affordability, exquisite soft tissue resolution, and the advantages of quick, dynamic diagnostic imaging. This pictorial essay describes and demonstrates the normal anatomy of the FCRt, its US examination technique and normal US appearance, and US findings of clinically relevant FCRt disorders.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658615","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.830373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.734457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.724589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.633261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.534078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.441027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Tendinitis","weight":0.341363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinitis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.245291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.155524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radius (bone)","weight":0.116707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_(bone)"},{"name":"Carpus","weight":0.115028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpus"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Flexor carpi radialis muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_carpi_radialis_muscle"},{"name":"Synovial sheath","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_sheath"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Dynamics (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Metastatic calcification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_calcification"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
