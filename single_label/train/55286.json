{"id":55286,"title":"Prevalence of self-reported early glaucoma eye drop bottle exhaustion and associated risk factors: a patient survey.","abstract":"One barrier to patient adherence with chronic topical glaucoma treatment is an inadequate amount of medication available between prescription refills. We examined the self-reported prevalence of early exhaustion of glaucoma eye drops prior to a scheduled refill, and associated risk factors.This cross-sectional survey was performed at a University-based clinical practice. Glaucoma patients at the University of Washington who were experienced with eye drop application and were on a steady regimen of self-administered glaucoma drops in both eyes took a survey at the time of clinic examination. The main outcome measure was self-reported early eye drop bottle exhaustion.236 patients were eligible and chose to participate. In general, patients included were relatively healthy (mean 2.3 comorbid medical conditions). Sixty patients (25.4%) reported any problem with early exhaustion of eye drop bottles, and this was associated with visual acuity ? 20/70 in the better eye (P = .049). Twelve patients (5.1%) reported that they \"often\" (5-7 times per year), \"usually\" (8-11 times per year) or \"always\" ran out of eye drops prior to a scheduled refill. Patients affected by this higher level (? 5 times yearly) of eye drop bottle exhaustion were more likely to have poor visual acuity in their worse eye ?? 20/70 (P = .015) and had significantly lower worse-eye logMAR (P = .043).Self-reported early glaucoma bottle exhaustion regularly affected 5% of patients in our population and 25% reported early exhaustion at least once; the main risk factor was poor vision in at least one eye. These results may not be generalizable to a broad patient population, or to those inexperienced with eye drop self-administration. However, this pilot study compels further evaluation and consideration of early eye drop bottle exhaustion in glaucoma patients.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927769","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.766821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.704189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.665592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.573549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.573334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.564199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.562222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"University of Washington","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Bottle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
