{"id":74027,"title":"Steering tumor progression through the transcriptional response to growth factors and stroma.","abstract":"Tumor progression can be understood as a collaborative effort of mutations and growth factors, which propels cell proliferation and matrix invasion, and also enables evasion of drug-induced apoptosis. Concentrating on EGFR, we discuss downstream signaling and the initiation of transcriptional events in response to growth factors. Specifically, we portray a wave-like program, which initiates by rapid disappearance of two-dozen microRNAs, followed by an abrupt rise of immediate early genes (IEGs), relatively short transcripts encoding transcriptional regulators. Concurrent with the fall of IEGs, some 30-60 min after stimulation, a larger group, the delayed early genes, is up-regulated and its own fall overlaps the rise of the final wave of late response genes. This late wave persists and determines long-term phenotype acquisition, such as invasiveness. Key regulatory steps in the orderly response to growth factors provide a trove of potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24873881","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.832778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.805421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immediate early gene","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_early_gene"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0649999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
