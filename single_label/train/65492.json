{"id":65492,"title":"Effect of dutasteride on microvessel density in benign prostatic hyperplasia.","abstract":"Dutasteride, a dual 5?-reductase inhibitor, is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, its histopathological effects on the morphometrics of blood vessels and glands are still controversial. This study aimed to assess the histopathological effects of dutasteride in cases of BPH in a retrospective manner.Patients with BPH were administered 0.5 mg of dutasteride daily or left untreated prior to undergoing holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). After HoLEP, remaining prostatic peripheral tissue at the bladder neck and the apex was resected. Each specimen was subjected to hematoxylin/eosin and immunohistochemical staining for CD31, and microvessel density (MVD) was analyzed.In the dutasteride-treated group (n=14), the mean duration of administration was 7.07Â±2.46 weeks. MVD was significantly lower at the bladder neck side in the dutasteride-treated group than in the control group (p=0.018).The present study, to our knowledge for the first time, assessed MVD by evaluating the bladder neck and apex sides of the remaining prostatic peripheral tissue after HoLEP, allowing evaluation of MVD in more detail without intraoperative damage of the peripheral tissue, such as through heat denaturation. Dutasteride reduces MVD in the bladder neck side of the prostate among patients with BPH and may lead to decreased risk of perioperative prostatic urethral bleeding.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815838","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.795466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.748048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.74513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.575536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.526523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dutasteride","weight":0.486111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutasteride"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.288635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Denaturation (biochemistry)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Holmium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmium"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Oxidoreductase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidoreductase"},{"name":"Neck of urinary bladder","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_of_urinary_bladder"}]}
