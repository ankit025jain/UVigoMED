{"id":89654,"title":"Bedside hip ultrasonography in the pediatric emergency department: a tool to guide management in patients presenting with limp.","abstract":"We present a case of a 3-year-old girl brought to the emergency department for evaluation of limp after falling off the monkey bars 1 day prior. X-rays of the entire left lower extremity were normal with no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or effusion. Point-of-care ultrasound of the left hip demonstrated a hip effusion, which prompted further imaging, ultimately revealing an occult fracture of the left proximal femoral metaphysis. This case demonstrates the ability of point-of-care ultrasound to guide the management of patients presenting to the pediatric emergency department with musculoskeletal complaints.
