{"id":28568,"title":"Acculturation and perceived discrimination: predictors of substance use trajectories from adolescence to emerging adulthood among Hispanics.","abstract":"Previous studies have documented associations between cultural factors and substance use among Hispanic adolescents. Negative cultural experiences such as discrimination have been associated with an increased risk of substance use among Hispanic adolescents, whereas positive cultural resources, such as maintenance of Hispanic cultural orientations, have shown protective effects. However, few studies have examined the continuing influence of cultural factors on substance use from adolescence to emerging adulthood.We surveyed a cohort of Hispanic adolescents in Southern California in 9th, 10th, and 11th grades, and 3-4 years after high school. Growth curve analyses were conducted to examine the effects of U.S. acculturation, Hispanic acculturation, ethnic identity, and perceived discrimination on change in tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use over time.Higher perceived discrimination at baseline was significantly associated with a higher intercept (initial level) of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use. Higher initial level of Hispanic acculturation was significantly associated with a lower slope of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use.Cultural phenomena such as acculturation and perceived discrimination can continue to affect substance use through the transition to emerging adulthood. Health education interventions are needed to help Hispanics navigate this developmental transition without engaging in substance use.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837753","annotations":[{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.672841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.668297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.630714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.511358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"School","weight":0.500743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.489608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Southern California","weight":0.473483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California"},{"name":"California","weight":0.47031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.444062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.400359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.37286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.352322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Acculturation","weight":0.310352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acculturation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Archaeology","weight":0.139479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0654645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0562587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Slope","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Ninth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_grade"},{"name":"Tenth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_grade"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"Eleventh grade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_grade"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"}]}
