{"id":62210,"title":"Dose intensification of methotrexate and cytarabine during intensified continuation chemotherapy for high-risk B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia: POG 9406: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.","abstract":"To determine the efficacy and toxicity of higher dose versus standard dose intravenous methotrexate (MTX) and pulses of high-dose cytosine arabinoside with asparaginase versus standard dose cytosine arabinoside and teniposide during intensified continuation therapy for higher risk pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).From 1994 to 1999, the Pediatric Oncology Group conducted a randomized phase III clinical trial in higher risk pediatric B-precursor ALL. A total of 784 patients were randomized in a 2×2 factorial design to receive MTX 1 g/m versus 2.5 g/m and to cytosine arabinoside/teniposide versus high-dose cytosine arabinoside/asparaginase during intensified continuation therapy.Patients receiving standard dose MTX had a 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 71.8±2.4%; patients receiving higher dose MTX had a 5-year DFS of 71.7±2.4% (P=0.55). Outcomes on cytosine arabinoside/teniposide (DFS of 70.4±2.4) were similar to higher dose cytosine arabinoside/asparaginase (DFS of 73.1±2.3%) (P=0.41). Overall survival rates were not different between MTX doses or cytosine arabinoside/teniposide versus cytosine arabinoside/asparaginase.Increasing MTX dosing to 2.5 g/m did not improve outcomes in higher risk pediatric B-precursor ALL. Giving high-dose cytarabine and asparaginase pulses instead of standard dose cytarabine and teniposide produced nonsignificant differences in outcomes, allowing for teniposide to be removed from ALL therapy.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608079","annotations":[{"name":"Teniposide","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teniposide"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.882746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Asparaginase","weight":0.762764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparaginase"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.650195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.639933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.623998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.604701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cytosine","weight":0.414423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine"},{"name":"Pediatric Oncology Group","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_Oncology_Group"},{"name":"Arabinose","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabinose"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Pulse (legume)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(legume)"}]}
