{"id":9694,"title":"Ultrastructure of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum in renal tubules of Dahl salt-sensitive rats.","abstract":"Metabolic and functional abnormalities in the kidney precede or coincide with the initiation of overt hypertension in the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat. However, renal histological injury in SS rats is mild before the development of overt hypertension. We performed electron microscopy analysis in 7-wk-old SS rats and salt-insensitive consomic SS.13(BN) rats and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats fed a 4% NaCl diet for 7 days. Long mitochondria (>2 ?m) accounted for a significantly smaller fraction of mitochondria in medullary thick ascending limbs in SS rats (4% ± 1%) than in SS.13(BN) rats (8% ± 1%, P < 0.05 vs. SS rats) and SD rats (9% ± 1%, P < 0.01 vs. SS rats), consistent with previous findings of mitochondrial functional insufficiency in the medulla of SS rats. Long mitochondria in proximal tubules, however, were more abundant in SS rats than in SS.13(BN) and SD rats. The width of the endoplasmic reticulum, an index of endoplasmic reticulum stress, was significantly greater in medullary thick ascending limbs of SS rats (107 ± 1 nm) than in SS.13(BN) rats (95 ± 2 nm, P < 0.001 vs. SS rats) and SD rats (74 ± 3 nm, P < 0.01 vs. SS or SS.13(BN) rats). The tubules examined were indistinguishable between rat strains under light microscopy. These data indicate that ultrastructural abnormalities occur in the medullary thick ascending limbs of SS rats before the development of histological injury in renal tubules, providing a potential structural basis contributing to the subsequent development of overt hypertension.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24694587","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Light microscopy","weight":0.745289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_microscopy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.687928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.671261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.660353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.642864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.57566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.490218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.454175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.415856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.293122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.211611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.146946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Medulla oblongata","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulla_oblongata"},{"name":"Tubule","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubule"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
