{"id":66400,"title":"Patient safety improvement through in situ simulation interdisciplinary team training.","abstract":"In situ simulation is an education strategy that promotes patient safety and enhances interdisciplinary teamwork. When a patient is experiencing an acute health status change or a rapidly emerging condition, teamwork is necessary to adequately and appropriately provide treatment. A unit-based quality improvement project was designed to enhance these skills. In situ simulation was used as the training venue for nurses and physicians to practice the techniques recommended in the evidence-based team-building model, TeamSTEPPS.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716380","annotations":[{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.663374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.411965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.268345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Patient safety","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Quality management","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.0267206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Team building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_building"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Teamwork","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamwork"}]}
