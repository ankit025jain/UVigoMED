{"id":7261,"title":"Acid mediates a prolonged antinociception via substance P signaling in acid-induced chronic widespread pain.","abstract":"Substance P is an important neuropeptide released from nociceptors to mediate pain signals. We recently revealed antinociceptive signaling by substance P in acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3)-expressing muscle nociceptors in a mouse model of acid-induced chronic widespread pain. However, methods to specifically trigger the substance P antinociception were still lacking.Here we show that acid could induce antinociceptive signaling via substance P release in muscle. We prevented the intramuscular acid-induced hyperalgesia by pharmacological inhibition of ASIC3 and transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1). The antinociceptive effect of non-ASIC3, non-TRPV1 acid signaling lasted for 2Â days. The non-ASIC3, non-TRPV1 acid antinociception was largely abolished in mice lacking substance P. Moreover, pretreatment with substance P in muscle mimicked the acid antinociceptive effect and prevented the hyperalgesia induced by next-day acid injection.Acid could mediate a prolonged antinociceptive signaling via the release of substance P from muscle afferent neurons in a non-ASIC3, non-TRPV1 manner.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886508","annotations":[{"name":"Substance P","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"TRPV","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Neuropeptide","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"TRPV1","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1"},{"name":"Transient receptor potential channel","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_channel"},{"name":"Nociceptor","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociceptor"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Afferent nerve fiber","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afferent_nerve_fiber"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.697668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.476844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.457586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.372927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.207882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.196893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Receptor potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_potential"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"}]}
