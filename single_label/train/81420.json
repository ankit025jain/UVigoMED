{"id":81420,"title":"Understanding root resorption with diagnostic imaging.","abstract":"This article presents the clinical, radiographic and histopathologic features of various types of tooth root resorption. Tooth resorption may occur in a tooth internally or externally with distinctively different treatment approaches for each type of resorption. Given that proper diagnosis of the type of resorption is important, the use of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and conventional 2-D intraoral images in evaluation of resorptive lesions is discussed.","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25080721","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.731918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.396987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Spiral computed tomography","weight":0.299711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"CBCT (TV)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBCT_(TV)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Root resorption","weight":0.0239124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_resorption"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Autism therapies","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_therapies"},{"name":"Resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resorption"}]}
