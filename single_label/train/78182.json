{"id":78182,"title":"A randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of online rehabilitative intervention for adult hearing-aid users.","abstract":"Previous research shows that the internet can be used in the rehabilitation of hearing-aid users. By further developing the online program, it might be possible to foster behavioral changes that will positively affect hearing-aid users.A randomized controlled study with two groups of participants. The intervention group underwent a five-week online intervention while the control group was referred to a waiting list. Questionnaires were used as outcome measures.Seventy-six experienced hearing-aid users participated in the study, ranging in age from 26 to 81 years (mean 69.3 years).The findings showed significant improvements in the intervention group after the intervention, measured by the hearing handicap inventory for the elderly. The effects were maintained and improved at the follow-up. Furthermore, the results indicated that the participants in the intervention group improved at two items of the international outcome inventory for hearing aids, and the effects were partly maintained at the follow-up. Finally, significant improvements in the domain of psychosocial wellbeing were found at the follow-up.This study provides further evidence that the internet can be used to deliver intervention of rehabilitation to hearing-aid users.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749664","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.794893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.673987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.643743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.554532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.356356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.327143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.248919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.241827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"E-learning","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Toynbee tiles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toynbee_tiles"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Behavior change (public health)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_change_(public_health)"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"}]}
