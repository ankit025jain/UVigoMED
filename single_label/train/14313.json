{"id":14313,"title":"[Effect of reinforcing qi for resolving masses method on expressions of MEK2 and p-ERK protein in estrogen induced uterine leiomyoma model guinea pigs' uterine tissue].","abstract":"To explore the effect of reinforcing qi for resolving masses method (RQRMM) on expressions of extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 (MEK2) and phosphorylation extracellular signal regulated kinase (p-ERK) protein in estrogen induced uterine leiomyoma model Guinea pigs' uterine tissue.Guinea pigs were randomly divided into five groups, i.e., the model group, the high dose group, the middle dose group, the low dose group, and the Western medicine group (mifepristone). The normal control group was set up. The uterine leiomyoma model in guinea pigs was established by castrating and subcutaneous injecting estradiol (E2). The protein expression levels of MEK2 and p-ERK of guinea pigs' uterine tissues were detected by immunohistochemical assay.The protein expressions of MEK2 and p-ERK in the uterine muscular tissue of Guinea pigs' uterine tissue were higher in the model group than in the normal group (P < 0.01). They decreased to some degree in the high dose group, the middle dose group, and the low dose group. Of them, the protein expressions of MEK2 and p-ERK were significantly lower in the high dose group than in the model group and the Western medicine group (P < 0.01).RQRMM could treat uterine leiomyoma possibly through intervening the MAPK/ERK cell signal pathway to inhibit the proliferation of myoma cells.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432690","annotations":[{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.747207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.738291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.638136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.549488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.520555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.474925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.424789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Castration","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.317851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.228122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Guinea pig","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.171578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.153709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mifepristone","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Facial expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"},{"name":"Guinea","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Elimination reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_reaction"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
