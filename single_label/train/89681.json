{"id":89681,"title":"Short segment pedicle screw instrumentation with an index level screw and cantilevered hyperlordotic reduction in the treatment of type-A fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of short segment pedicle screw instrumentation and an intermediate screw (SSPI+IS) on the radiological outcome of type A thoracolumbar fractures, as judged by the load-sharing classification, percentage canal area reduction and remodelling. We retrospectively evaluated 39 patients who had undergone hyperlordotic SSPI+IS for an AO-Magerl Type-A thoracolumbar fracture. Their mean age was 35.1 (16 to 60) and the mean follow-up was 22.9 months (12 to 36). There were 26 men and 13 women in the study group. In total, 18 patients had a load-sharing classification score of seven and 21 a score of six. All radiographs and CT scans were evaluated for sagittal index, anterior body height compression (%ABC), spinal canal area and encroachment. There were no significant differences between the low and high score groups with respect to age, duration of follow-up, pre-operative sagittal index or pre-operative anterior body height compression (p = 0.217, 0.104, 0.104, and 0.109 respectively). The mean pre-operative sagittal index was 19.6° (12° to 28°) which was corrected to -1.8° (-5° to 3°) post-operatively and 2.4° (0° to 8°) at final follow-up (p = 0.835 for sagittal deformity). No patient needed revision for loss of correction or failure of instrumentation. Hyperlordotic reduction and short segment pedicle screw instrumentation and an intermediate screw is a safe and effective method of treating burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. It gives excellent radiological results with a very low rate of failure regardless of whether the fractures have a high or low load-sharing classification score.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692625","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Sagittal plane","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittal_plane"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.523591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Spinal canal","weight":0.462361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_canal"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.361956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.232302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.216755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.121983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Human height","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height"},{"name":"American Broadcasting Company","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/217"},{"name":"835","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/835"},{"name":"Instrumentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Cantilever bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantilever_bridge"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"Lateral horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"High score","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_score"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
