{"id":24336,"title":"Subcutaneous mycoses. Part 1: subcutaneous mycoses due to non-dermatophytes.","abstract":"Subcutaenous mycoses are increasingly reported in the literature for various reasons. Firstly, life expectancy has increased and even patients with cancer and/or immunodepression live longer, making them susceptible to these infections. Secondly, diagnostic techniques for mycoses have improved. Dermatologists have now begun to suspect subcutaneous mycoses when faced with certain clinical pictures and are aware of the need for histopathological examination and culture of lesion biopsy material on appropriate culture media. This review considers the clinical, histopathological and mycological aspects of the most common subcutaneous mycoses and outlines how to treat them. A better understanding of these mycoses enables early diagnosis and treatment of infections that are sometimes life-threatening.
