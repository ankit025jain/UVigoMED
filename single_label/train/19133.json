{"id":19133,"title":"Real-time PCR detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia.","abstract":"Polymerase chain reaction is a useful technique in microbial diagnostics to detect and quantify DNA or RNA of low abundance. Bacterial and viral nucleic acid can be amplified by PCR upon clinical sample extraction using specific primers for classical qualitative PCR and primers and probes for real-time PCR. Here we describe the Scorpion-probe real-time PCR-based assay that offers thermodynamic advantages due to its kinetic reaction and provides faster performances compared to a classical double-labeled probe-based assays.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24740224","annotations":[{"name":"Nucleic acid","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.643407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Thermodynamics","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.560623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.491766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.488478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.470755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.301538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.203998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mycoplasma pneumoniae","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.0656504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Abundance of the chemical elements","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements"}]}
