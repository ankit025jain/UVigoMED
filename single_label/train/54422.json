{"id":54422,"title":"Twenty-four-hour urinary aldosterone predicts inappropriate left ventricular mass index in patients with primary aldosteronism.","abstract":"Primary aldosteronism (PA) is associated with inappropriate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in relation to a given gender and body size. There is no ideal parameter to predict the presence of LVH or inappropriate LVH in patients with PA. We investigate the performance of 24-hour urinary aldosterone level, plasma renin activity and aldosterone-to-renin ratio on this task.We performed echocardiography in 106 patients with PA and 31 subjects with essential hypertension (EH) in a tertiary teaching hospital. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone concentration, and 24-hour urinary aldosterone level were measured.Only 24-hour urinary aldosterone was correlated with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and excess LVMI among these parameters. The multivariate analysis revealed the urinary aldosterone level as an independent predictor for LVMI and excess LVMI. Analyzing the ability of urinary aldosterone, plasma aldosterone concentration, and plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio to identify the presence of LVH (ROC AUC?=?0.701, 0.568, 0.656, resp.) and the presence of inappropriate LV mass index (defined as measured LVMI in predicting LVMI ratio >135%) (ROC area under curve = 0.61, 0.43, 0.493, resp.) revealed the better performance of 24-hour urinary aldosterone.In conclusion, 24-hour urinary aldosterone level performed better to predict the presence of LVH and inappropriate LVMI in patients with PA.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459427","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Aldosterone","weight":0.352778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone"},{"name":"Renin","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin"},{"name":"Left ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.154061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricular hypertrophy","weight":0.047465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_hypertrophy"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Primary aldosteronism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_aldosteronism"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Plasma renin activity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_renin_activity"},{"name":"Hyperaldosteronism","weight":0.0288827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperaldosteronism"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0275663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Essential hypertension","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_hypertension"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"568","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/568"},{"name":"701","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/701"},{"name":"656","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/656"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
