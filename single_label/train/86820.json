{"id":86820,"title":"[The lysate and recombinant antigens in ELISA-test-systems for diagnostic of herpes simplex].","abstract":"The lysate and recombinant antigens of various production included informula of ELISA-test-systems were analyzed. The ELISA-test-systems are used for detection of IgG to Herpes simplex virus type I and II. For testing the panel of serums PTH 201 (BBI Inc.) were used. The samples of this panel contain antibodies to Herpes simplex virus type I and II in mixed titers. The 69 serums of donors were used too (17 samples had IgG to Herpes simplex virus type I, 23 samples to Herpes simplex virus type II and 29 samples had no antibodies to Herpes simplex virus). The diagnostic capacity of mixture of recombinant antigens gG1 Herpes simplex virus type I and gG2 Herpes simplex virus type II (The research-and-production complex \"DiaprofMed\") was comparable with mixture of lysate antigen Herpes simplex virus type I and II (Membrane) EIE Antigen (\"Virion Ltd.\"). In the test-systems for differentiation of IgG to Herpes simplex virus type I the recombinant antigen gG1 Herpes simplex virus type I proved to be comparable with commercial analogue Herpes simplex virus-1 gG1M (\"Viral Therapeutics Inc.\"'). At the same time, capacity to detect IgG to Herpes simplex virus type II in recombinant protein gG2 Herpes simplex virus type II is significantly higher than in its analogue Herpes simplex virus-2 gG2c (\"Viral Therapeutics Inc.\").","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552056","annotations":[{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Virion","weight":0.807084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virion"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.792843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.611555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.492779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.126367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0289708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Simplex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"Mixture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Burton Blatt Institute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_Blatt_Institute"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Arsenal firm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_firm"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Astra 1M","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_1M"}]}
