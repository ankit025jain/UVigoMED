{"id":70473,"title":"Mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling of in vivo tumor uptake, catabolism, and tumor response of trastuzumab maytansinoid conjugates.","abstract":"Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of trastuzumab linked to the antimitotic agent DM1, has shown promising results in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Investigations of the mechanisms of the action of ADCs, including T-DM1, have been primarily descriptive or semiquantitative. However, quantitative pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis may provide insights into their complex behavior. The analyses described herein applied PK/PD modeling to nonclinical studies of maytansinoid conjugates.The maytansinoid conjugates T-DM1 and T-SPP-DM1, with thioether and disulfide linkers, respectively, were tested in mouse efficacy, PK, and tumor uptake studies. (3)[H]DM1-bearing ADCs were used to facilitate the quantitation of the ADCs in plasma, as well as ADC and ADC catabolites in tumors. Three mechanistic PK/PD models were used to characterize plasma ADC, tumor ADC, and tumor catabolite concentrations. Tumor catabolite concentrations were used to fit tumor response. Model parameters were estimated using R software and nonlinear least squares regression.Plasma ADC-associated DM1 concentrations of T-DM1 decreased more slowly than those of T-SPP-DM1, likely due to slower DM1 release. A comparison of the mechanistic models found that the best model allowed catabolism and catabolite exit rates to differ between ADCs, that T-DM1 exhibited both faster tumor catabolism and catabolite exit rate from tumors than T-SPP-DM1; findings inconsistent with expected behavior based on the physicochemical nature of the respective catabolites. Tumor catabolite concentrations adequately described tumor response with both ADCs showing similar potency.Mechanistic PK/PD studies described herein provided results that confirmed and challenged current hypotheses, and suggested new areas of investigation.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25186956","annotations":[{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.701877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.697854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.618045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Catabolism","weight":0.548063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.390174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.383742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.26678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Metastatic breast cancer","weight":0.26201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_breast_cancer"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Disulfide","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Physical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"}]}
