{"id":69275,"title":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of target terapies for the treatment of metastatic renal cancer.","abstract":"At present there are several drugs for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (ARCC). The main objective of this work was to perform a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) of clinical randomized studies that compared target cell therapies (TCT).SR identified clinical randomized trials that compared TCT versus interferon-alpha in the treatment of patients with ARCC. In order to analyze efficiency, it was evaluated free-survival progression (FSP), total survival (TS) and response rate (RR).In relation to first line treatment, seven studies of TCT were identified using sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab and temsirolimus; and two studies with sorafenib and everolimus for second line treatment. Relative risk (RRi) of MA for FSP of first line therapies was: 0.83, CI = 0.78-0.87, I2 = 94% and p < 0.00001. Best results of RR of specific FSP among studies were: 0.38, sunitinib, CI = 0.25-0.58, bevacizumab, 0.62, CI = 0.47-0.83; and temsirolimus, 0.78, CI = 0.70-0.87. MA didn't show any benefit regarding TS of first line treatment of all analyzed drugs. As for RR significant results were: sunitinib, 3.83 CI = 2.86-5.12; bevacizumab, 2.52 CI = 1.78-3.57 and bevacizumab, 1.97 CI = 1.43-2.71.For first line treatment, sunitinib was the most effective TCT in relation to FPS; there was no alteration of TS and RR was small but significant for sunitinib and bevacizumab. Available studies could not conclude any results for second line treatments.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456785","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Sunitinib","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunitinib"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Everolimus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everolimus"},{"name":"Temsirolimus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temsirolimus"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.811179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.733152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.530287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.415674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.404448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.290373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"780","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/780"},{"name":"783","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/783"},{"name":"865","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/865"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Second line (parades)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_line_(parades)"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Target cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_cell"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"People's Socialist Front","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Socialist_Front"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_Rescue_Coordination_Centre"},{"name":"First-person shooter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"470 (dinghy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/470_(dinghy)"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"},{"name":"Tri-State Christian Television","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-State_Christian_Television"}]}
