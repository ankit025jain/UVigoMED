{"id":22425,"title":"A randomized controlled trial of standard versus intensified tuberculosis diagnostics on treatment decisions by physicians in Northern Tanzania.","abstract":"Routine tuberculosis culture remains unavailable in many high-burden areas, including Tanzania. This study sought to determine the impact of providing mycobacterial culture results over standard of care [unconcentrated acid-fast (AFB) smears] on management of persons with suspected tuberculosis.Adults and children with suspected tuberculosis were randomized to standard (direct AFB smear only) or intensified (concentrated AFB smear and tuberculosis culture) diagnostics and followed for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was appropriate treatment (i.e. antituberculosis therapy for those with tuberculosis, no antituberculous therapy for those without tuberculosis).Seventy participants were randomized to standard (n?=?37, 53%) or intensive (n?=?33, 47%) diagnostics. At 8 weeks, 100% (n?=?22) of participants in follow up randomized to intensive diagnostics were receiving appropriate care, vs. 22 (88%) of 25 participants randomized to standard diagnostics (p?=?0.14). Overall, 18 (26%) participants died; antituberculosis therapy was associated with lower mortality (9% who received antiuberculosis treatment died vs. 26% who did not, p?=?0.04).Under field conditions in a high burden setting, the impact of intensified diagnostics was blunted by high early mortality. Enhanced availability of rapid diagnostics must be linked to earlier access to care for outcomes to improve.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552306","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.90712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.877773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tanzania","weight":0.671232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.545331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.379825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Northern Hemisphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
