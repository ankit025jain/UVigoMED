{"id":79028,"title":"A DFNA5 mutation identified in Japanese families with autosomal dominant hereditary hearing loss.","abstract":"Mutations in DFNA5 lead to autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hereditary hearing loss (NSHHL). To date, four different mutations in DFNA5 have been reported to cause hearing loss. A 3 bp deletion mutation (c.991-15_991-13del) was identified in Chinese and Korean families with autosomal dominant NSHHL, which suggested that the 3 bp deletion mutation was derived from a single origin. In the present study, we performed genetic screening of mutations in the interval between intron 6 and exon 9 of DFNA5 in 65 Japanese patients with autosomal dominant NSHHL and identified the c.991-15_991-13del mutation in two patients. Furthermore, we compared the DFNA5-linked haplotypes consisting of intragenic SNPs between the reported Chinese and Korean families and found that the Japanese patients showed a shared region spanning 41,874 bp. This is the first report of DFNA5 mutations in Japanese patients with autosomal dominant NSHHL, supporting the suggestion that the 3 bp deletion mutation occurred in their ancestors.
