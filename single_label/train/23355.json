{"id":23355,"title":"Chronic cough.","abstract":"Chronic cough is often viewed as a difficult clinical problem. It can be physically and psychologically debilitating, occasionally leading to serious complications. Although there are many etiologies, an organized approach including focused history and physical examination, directed testing in select cases, and treatment trials lead to accurate, safe, and cost-effective diagnoses in most patients. Additional symptomatic treatment is frequently beneficial. Occasionally, diagnostic dilemmas, treatment failures, or more serious causative disorders necessitate referral for further testing and management.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490448","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.668578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.577691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.493297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.35105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.314337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.304301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.244966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"}]}
