{"id":83262,"title":"[Characterization of the whole genome from a human parechovirus type 3 detected from the serum of a child with sepsis in Beijing, China].","abstract":"Human parechovirus type 3 (HPeV3) is an important pathogen of severe sepsis. HPeV3 is a non- enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a linear and continuous genomic RNA. The complete genome of a HPeV3 (BJ-C3174) strain was analyzed from the serum specimen from a child with sepsis hospitalized in Beijing, China, in 2012. The whole genome of BJ-C3174 was 7329 nucleotides (nt) in length excluding a poly (A) tail. One large open reading frame (ORF) of 6531 nt encoding a putative polyprotein precursor of 2177 amino acids (aa) was flanked by a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 709 nt and 3' UTR of 91 nt. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BJ-C3174 belonged to HPeV3 and was closest to the HPeV3 strain BONN-2 from Germany. Compared with HPeV1-8 reference strains, BJ-C3174 shared the highest similarities with BONN-2 in full length and in each of the gene segments of the genome. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid identities of the whole genome between BJ-C3174 and BONN-2 were 99.3% and 99.8%, respectively, which were higher than those compared with HPeV3 prototype. Recom- bination of the gene segment with other HPeVs types was not identified.","date":"2015-01-07","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562964","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.895066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.809625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Polyadenylation","weight":0.803965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Viral envelope","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_envelope"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Reading frame","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"China","weight":0.732136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.460235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.445037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.135852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Type three secretion system","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_three_secretion_system"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"ORF (broadcaster)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORF_(broadcaster)"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Polyphyly","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyly"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Continuum (theory)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory)"}]}
