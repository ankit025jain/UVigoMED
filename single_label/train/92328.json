{"id":92328,"title":"Update on evaluation and treatment of scoliosis.","abstract":"Scoliosis is a spinal deformity that can be seen in children of all ages. It is most commonly seen as an adolescent idiopathic condition. Progressive scoliosis between 25° and 45° before skeletal and physiologic maturity can be treated with a brace, whereas progressive scoliosis greater than 50° should be treated surgically. For children younger than 10 years, it is important to not only prevent scoliosis from worsening but to also maintain the growth of the spine and chest wall through the use of growth-friendly surgical techniques. Spinal fusion and instrumentation surgery is generally reserved for adolescent patients.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25439021","annotations":[{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"Spinal fusion","weight":0.783059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_fusion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.599044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.368384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.227306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.199263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Kyphosis","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Progressive rock","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"},{"name":"Thoracic wall","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_wall"}]}
