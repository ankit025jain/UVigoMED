{"id":83633,"title":"[Robotic-assisted surgery in urogynecology--our experience with the first 100 cases: experience from a single institution].","abstract":"The prevalence of surgery for pelvic organ prolapse repair is increasing. It is estimated that about 30% of women who underwent an operation for pelvic organ prolapse will need repeat surgery within a period of five years. The main reasons for surgical failure are attributed to difficulty in selecting the correct procedure for the type of prolapse and problems associated with the surgical technique. Sacrocolpopexy was originally described 55 years ago. However, expertise in laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy requires a relatively long learning curve.To describe our experience in robotic sacrocolpopexy (RSC).A retrospective study of the first 100 robotic sacrocolpopexy performed at a single medical center The primary outcomes examined were intraoperative bleeding, operative time, and hospitalization length. Secondary outcomes studied were surgical complications. Data were retrieved from patients electronic charts.The mean age and POPQ stage were 60 years 145-77 years) and median stage of III (II-IV), respectively. Estimated intraoperative blood loss was 41 ml (25-300 ml) and mean operative time was 177 minutes (range 114-299 minutes). The median length of hospital stay was 1 day (1-6 days). Adverse events were rare (4%) and not severe.Based on our experience with the first 100 cases, RSC is a feasible procedure with a low complication rate. RSC enables operating anatomically with a small amount of bleeding and a relatively short hospital stay following surgery. Long-term follow up is needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of RSC.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286633","annotations":[{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.434377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.266938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.150034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.113499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Robotics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Nautical chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_chart"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Royal Shakespeare Company","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Shakespeare_Company"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Learning curve","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve"}]}
