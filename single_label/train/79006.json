{"id":79006,"title":"A comparison of vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) between definite Meniere's disease patients and normal healthy adults.","abstract":"To compare the results of VEMP between unilateral definite Meniere's disease patients and normal healthy adults.Thirty-two patients with unilateral definite Meniere's disease patients and 32 age-matched normal healthy adults (control) underwent VEMP tests with short tone burst of 500 Hz at 90 dBnHL. Student-t test was used for comparison of means of all parameters between two groups.Absent VEMP response was found in 14 MD patients and abnormal asymmetry ratio (AR) was found in five MD patients. Normal responses were found in all subjects of the control group. The mean P1 and N1 latencies, VEMP amplitude between unilateral MD, and control were not significantly different between two groups. However the difference between the mean AR of both groups showed statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). The upper limit of normal AR was calculated to be of 35.15%.The absence of VEMP response and AR of VEMP were more dominant than other parameters such as P1 and N1 latencies or VEMP amplitude in the detection of saccular dysfunction in MD. The results suggested that AR should be used as a tool in interpretation of VEMP response for the diagnostic batteries in MD. The upper limit of normal AR of < or = 35% should be recommended.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511721","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.403169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.371893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.352482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.198481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.121984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Arkansas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Timbre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Interpretation (logic)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)"},{"name":"Limit (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Myogenic contraction","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myogenic_contraction"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
