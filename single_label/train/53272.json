Our efforts have led to compound 1, N-((2H-tetrazol-5-yl)methyl)-4-((R)-1-((5r,8R)-8-(tert-butyl)-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2-oxo-1,4-diazaspiro[4.5]dec-3-en-1-yl)-4,4-dimethylpentyl)benzamide (SCH 900822), a potent hGCGR antagonist with exceptional selectivity over the human glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor. Oral administration of 1 lowered 24 h nonfasting glucose levels in imprinting control region mice on a high fat diet with diet-induced obesity following single oral doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, compound 1, when dosed orally, was found to decrease fasting blood glucose at 30 mg/kg in a streptozotocin-treated, diet-induced obesity mouse pharmacodynamic assay and blunt exogenous glucagon-stimulated glucose excursion in prediabetic mice.
