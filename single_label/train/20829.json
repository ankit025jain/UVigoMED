{"id":20829,"title":"Establishing a role for vancomycin powder application for prosthetic joint infection prevention-results of a wear simulation study.","abstract":"Topical vancomycin powder (VP) has shown efficacy and safety in decreasing post-operative spine infections. VP use in arthroplasty has not been established. Concerns remain for third-body wear with the addition of crystalline substrate at the implant interface. The study's purpose was to compare wear behavior of CoCr on UHMWPE to identical wear couples with VP. A six-station wear simulator was utilized and cyclic articulations were run for 10 million cycles (Mc). UHMWPE wear was measured using photography, stereomicroscopy, and gravimetric measurement. There were no differences in wear mark length (P = 0.43), width (P = 0.49), or gravimetric wear at 10 Mc (P = 0.98). VP and control groups lost 0.32 and 0.33 mg, respectively. VP may have a role in PJI prevention. A well-designed clinical study is needed.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636904","annotations":[{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.709136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.426716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Crystallinity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallinity"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Interface (computing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)"},{"name":"Cyclic compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_compound"},{"name":"VP Records","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP_Records"},{"name":"Gravitation","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"}]}
