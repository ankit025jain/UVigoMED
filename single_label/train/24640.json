{"id":24640,"title":"[Effects of aerobic exercise training on antihypertension and expressions of VEGF, eNOS of skeletal muscle in spontaneous hypertensive rats].","abstract":"To investigate effects of exercise training on vascular regulators and discuss its antihypertensive mechanism.Rats were divided into three groups (n = 7): spontaneous hypertensive rats control group (SHR-C), training group (SHR-T) and normotensive wistar-kyoto control group (WKY-C). Aerobic exercise consisted of 10 weeks of swimming training for 5 days/week. Exercise duration was 40 min in the first week, then 50 min in the second week, from the third week to the end of training, duration was maintained at 60 min. After training, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other biomarkers in soleus were measured by RT-PCR and immunoblotting.VEGF and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in SHR-C were lower than that in WKY-C (P < 0.05). Blood pressure in SHR-C and SHR-T were higher than that in WKY-C before training; After training, compared with SHR-C, VEGFR2, eNOS, VEGF and VEGF mRNA increased significantly in SHR-T paralleled with marked decreases in blood pressure and heart rate respectively (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).Aerobic exercise training lowered the blood pressure in spontaneous hypertensive rats, and promoted VEGF mRNA level and expressions of VEGF, VEGFR2 and eNOS. The up-regulations of these vascular regulators could benefit angiogenesis and contribute to the antihypertensive effects.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330667","annotations":[{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.884642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.741659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Cellular respiration","weight":0.645644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.567719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Kinase insert domain receptor","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase_insert_domain_receptor"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.307366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0842264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Soleus muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soleus_muscle"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence"},{"name":"Swimming (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
