{"id":74046,"title":"Inhibition of miR-17 and miR-20a by oridonin triggers apoptosis and reverses chemoresistance by derepressing BIM-S.","abstract":"Cancer cell chemoresistance arises in part through the acquisition of apoptotic resistance. Leukemia cells resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis have been found to be sensitive to oridonin, a natural agent with potent anticancer activity. To investigate its mechanisms of action in reversing chemoresistance, we compared the response of human leukemia cells with oridonin and the antileukemia drugs Ara-C and VP-16. Compared with HL60 cells, K562 and K562/ADR cells displayed resistance to apoptosis stimulated by Ara-C and VP-16 but sensitivity to oridonin. Mechanistic investigations revealed that oridonin upregulated BIM-S by diminishing the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a, leading to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, neither Ara-C nor VP-16 could reduce miR-17 and miR-20a expression or could trigger BIM-S-mediated apoptosis. Notably, silencing miR-17 or miR-20a expression by treatment with microRNA (miRNA; miR) inhibitors or oridonin restored sensitivity of K562 cells to VP-16. Synergistic effects of oridonin and VP-16 were documented in cultured cells as well as mouse tumor xenograft assays. Inhibiting miR-17 or miR-20a also augmented the proapoptotic activity of oridonin. Taken together, our results identify a miRNA-dependent mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of oridonin and provide a rationale for its combination with chemotherapy drugs in addressing chemoresistant leukemia cells.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872388","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.833212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.712311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.673504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.644154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.578864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.568502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.525419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.376747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.352562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.325566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.261966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"HL60","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL60"},{"name":"Herpes simplex virus protein vmw65","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus_protein_vmw65"},{"name":"House of Lords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"}]}
