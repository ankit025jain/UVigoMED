{"id":67950,"title":"Retroperitoneal laparoendoscopic single-site ureterolithotomy versus conventional laparoscopic ureterolithotomy.","abstract":"Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery through the retroperitoneal approach has been seldom reported. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of LESS and conventional laparoscopic surgery via the retroperitoneal approach in the management of large, impacted ureteral calculi.Between November 2011 and July 2013, retroperitoneal LESS ureterolithotomy was performed in 12 patients using a homemade single-port device comprising a surgical glove and several strips of tape. Another 16 patients underwent conventional retroperitoneal laparoscopic ureterolithotomy. We compared the operative time, complications, and surgical outcomes, retrospectively.All patients were completed without conversion to conventional laparoscopic or open surgery. The operative time of the LESS group and of the conventional laparoscopic group were (125.3 ± 12.8) minutes and (116.9 ± 14.4) minutes, respectively (P = 0.119). The intraoperative blood loss was (42.9 ± 8.9) and (43.4 ± 14.7) ml, respectively (P = 0.914). Postoperative radiologic evaluation revealed that the stones had been removed completely. Cosmetic results were superior in the LESS group (P = 0.001).Retroperitoneal LESS ureterolithotomy using a homemade single-port device can be considered a feasible and safe alternative to conventional laparoscopic ureterolithotomy.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571878","annotations":[{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.545335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.394638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.337219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.292857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0672669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Compact Cassette","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette"},{"name":"Glove","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"},{"name":"Medical glove","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_glove"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
