{"id":20503,"title":"Toenail onychomycosis treated with a fractional carbon-dioxide laser and topical antifungal cream.","abstract":"Traditional pharmacotherapy for onychomycosis has low to moderate efficacy and may be associated with adverse reactions and medication interactions limiting its use in many patients.We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of a fractional carbon-dioxide laser with topical antifungal therapy in the treatment of onychomycosis.In all, 24 patients were treated with fractional carbon-dioxide laser therapy and a topical antifungal cream. The laser treatment consisted of 3 sessions at 4-week intervals. Efficacy was assessed based on the response rate from standardized photographs, a microscopic examination of subungual debris, and subjective evaluations.Among the patients, 92% showed a clinical response and 50% showed a complete response with a negative microscopic result. The factors that influenced a successful outcome were the type of onychomycosis and the thickness of the nail plate before treatment. The treatment regimen was well tolerated and there was no recurrence 3 months after the last treatment episode.The study followed up only 24 patients and there were no relevant treatment controls.Fractional carbon-dioxide laser therapy, combined with a topical antifungal agent, was effective in the treatment of onychomycosis. It should be considered an alternative therapeutic option in patients for whom systemic antifungal agents are contraindicated.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24655819","annotations":[{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.793741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.692299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.64757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.626444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.440478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Onychomycosis","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychomycosis"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.243256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.203971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.196784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Nail plate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_plate"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Laser surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_surgery"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Ungual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungual"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Debris","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
