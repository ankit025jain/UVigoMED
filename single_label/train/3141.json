{"id":3141,"title":"A psychiatric medication decision support guide for social work practice with pregnant and postpartum women.","abstract":"In their work in human services organizations and community agencies across service sectors, social workers encounter pregnant and postpartum women experiencing mental health challenges. This article offers an evidence-informed Decision Support Guide designed for use by social workers working with pregnant and postpartum women who are struggling with complicated decisions about psychiatric medication use. The guide is built on contemporary notions of health literacy and shared decision making and is informed by three areas: (1) research into the lived experiences of pregnant and postpartum women and health care providers around psychiatric medication decision making, (2) a critical review of existing decision aids, and (3) feedback on the strategy from social work practitioners who work with pregnant and postpartum women. Emphasizing the relational nature of social work in supporting effective health-related decision making, the guide relies on maintaining a collaborative practice milieu and using a decision aid that engages clients in discussions about mental health during and around the time of pregnancy. The guide offers social workers a practice tool to support responsive and compassionate care by embracing their roles in problem solving and decision making, providing emotional and psychosocial support, and making appropriate referrals to prescribers.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25365831","annotations":[{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Social work","weight":0.77212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Problem solving","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.743227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Literacy","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.579425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.492411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.49088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.402574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.311485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Social environment","weight":0.307345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.2819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.272668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Decision support system","weight":0.228921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support_system"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Psychiatric medication","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_medication"},{"name":"Tertiary sector of the economy","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy"},{"name":"Health literacy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy"},{"name":"Leptospirosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Customer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer"}]}
