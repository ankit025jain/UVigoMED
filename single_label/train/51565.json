{"id":51565,"title":"Treatment of mild and moderate type-2 diabetes: open prospective trial with Hintonia latiflora extract.","abstract":"Extracts from the bark of Hintonia latiflora are used as dietetic measures to support the regulation of glucose metabolism and the stabilization of blood glucose values.A dry concentrated extract from the bark of Hintonia latiflora in capsule form was tested in an open, prospective clinical study in 41 dietetically stabilized subjects with type 2 diabetes. The effects on parameters of blood glucose control were documented over a period of six months.Fasting and postprandial glucose and the HbA1c value declined significantly. In the case of HbA1c, this meant a reduction of the absolute value from 7.49?±?0.72% to 6.82?±?0.67% (from 58.4 to 51.0 mmol/mol Hb; intention to treat (ITT) population). Furthermore, cholesterol and triglycerides were slightly reduced and no negative effect on other laboratory parameters and no change of the liver values were observed. Tolerance was very good. In particular, no side effects and no hypoglycemic episodes or worsening of diabetic symptoms occurred.The study confirms the positive effect of extracts from the bark of Hintonia latiflora on blood glucose values suggesting a potential benefit in the management of glucose metabolism in cases of type 2 diabetes.Reg.-No. ISRCTN83308122.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678614","annotations":[{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Postprandial","weight":0.790162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Diet food","weight":0.361966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_food"},{"name":"Intention to treat analysis","weight":0.355396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_to_treat_analysis"},{"name":"Bark","weight":0.280424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Prohibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Stabilizer (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilizer_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
