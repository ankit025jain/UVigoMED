{"id":82895,"title":"Antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite in endodontics.","abstract":"One of the major objectives in endodontic therapy is to disinfect the entire root canal system. This goal may be achieved using mechanical instrumenation and chemical irrigation in conjunrction with medication of the root canal between treatment sessions. Microorganisms and their by-products are considered to be the major cause of pulpal and periradicular patholic. In order to reduce or eliminate bacteria and popular tissue remnants, the use of various irrigation solution during treatment have been suggested. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI), the most common irrigant, is an excellent nonspecific proteolytic and antimicrobial agent. The purpose of this paper is to review the antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494267","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium hypochlorite","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.802814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.497478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Hypochlorite","weight":0.397412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorite"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.340018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.328267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.317957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"By-product","weight":0.198926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-product"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Root canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"}]}
