{"id":21174,"title":"Non-conversion of sputum culture among patients with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis in Cameroon: a prospective cohort study.","abstract":"We investigated the determinants of sputum culture non-conversion following intensive phase of treatment, and assessed the effects on the outcome among patients treated for a first episode of smear positive tuberculosis (TB).This was a prospective cohort study spanning October 2009 to May 2012, among patients treated for a first episode of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis in the Chest service of the Yaounde Jamot Hospital, Cameroon. Logistic regressions models were used to relate baseline characteristics with non-conversion of sputum cultures after the intensive phase of treatment.A total of 953 patients were admitted to the service during the study period, including 97 (10.2%) who had a positive sputum smear at the end of the intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Eighty-six patients with persistent of smear positive sputa at the end of intensive phase of TB treatment were included, among whom 46 (53%) had positive sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (C+). The absence of haemoptysis [adjusted odd ratio 4.65 (95% confidence intervals: 1.14-18.95)] and current smoking [7.26 (1.59-33.23)] were the main determinants of sputum culture non-conversion. Of the 46C + patients, 7 (15%) were resistant to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug. Treatment failure rate was 28% among C + patients and 8% among C- patients (p = 0.023). The sensitivity and specificity were 78.6% and 55.4% for culture non-conversion after intensive treatment, in predicting anti-TB treatment failure.Failure rate is high among patients with positive sputum culture after intensive treatment, even in the absence of multi-drug resistant bacilli. Treatment should be closely monitored in these patients and susceptibility to anti-tuberculosis drugs tested in the presence of persistent positive smears following the intensive phase of treatment.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618155","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Hemoptysis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.710769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.684793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sputum culture","weight":0.517586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum_culture"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.511136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.369595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.32743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cameroon","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.240999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.208641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Mean time between failures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_between_failures"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"}]}
