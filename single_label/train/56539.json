{"id":56539,"title":"Rose-K versus Soper contact lens in keratoconus: a randomized comparative trial.","abstract":"To perform a comparative evaluation of the efficacy and acceptability of Rose-K and Soper contact lenses in Keratoconus.Dr. Rajendra Prasad Center for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.A randomized comparative clinical trial was performed in keratoconic eyes fitted with Rose-K (Rose-K group) and Soper (Soper group) contact lenses. Patients data were evaluated for best spectacle corrected visual acuity, best contact lens corrected visual acuity (BCLCVA), corneal topography, glare acuity, contrast sensitivity, tear function tests and specular microscopy. Patients were also asked to complete a self-reported comfort questionnaire at each visit.Sixty eyes were randomized to the Rose-K and Soper groups. The two groups were comparable in all the baseline parameters. There was a statistically significant improvement in BCLCVA in both groups at 3 months (P < 0.01, both groups). The difference between in BCLCVA in both groups was not statistically significant. In both groups, there was a significant improvement in the comfort score at 3 months compared to baseline (P < 0.05, both group). The Rose-K group had statistically significantly better scores at 1 and 3 months compared with the Soper group (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001 respectively). Both groups were associated with a significant (P < 0.01), but comparable improvement in glare acuity at 3 months. There was a significant improvement in contrast sensitivity at 3 months in both groups (P < 0.01); the Rose-K group was significantly better than the Soper group at 1 and 3 months (P = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively). The mean number of trial lenses required for fitting Rose-K lens (2.00 ± 0.59) was significantly lower than the Soper lens (3.43 ± 0.82; P < 0.001).Both the contact lens designs provide an equal improvement in visual acuity in patients with Keratoconus. However, Rose-K contact lens provides greater comfort, better quality of vision and requires less chair time compared with the Soper lens and hence may possibly have a greater acceptability.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669146","annotations":[{"name":"Contact lens","weight":0.810624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.792698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"India","weight":0.690567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.632167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.593938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.577691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.537512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"New Delhi","weight":0.535303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi"},{"name":"Corneal topography","weight":0.532951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_topography"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.376526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.32921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Delhi","weight":0.292047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.263613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.194444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.070898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Contrast (vision)","weight":0.0579544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Institute_of_Medical_Sciences"},{"name":"Rajendra Prasad","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Prasad"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0215179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Light pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Specular reflection","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
