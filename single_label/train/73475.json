{"id":73475,"title":"Case-control study of breast cancer in India: Role of PERIOD3 clock gene length polymorphism and chronotype.","abstract":"This study examined a PERIOD3 (PER3) gene variable number tandem repeat polymorphism and chronotype as potential BrCA risk factors among Indian women.This case-control study included sporadic, histologically confirmed BrCA cases (n = 255) and controls (n = 249) from India with data collection from 2010-2012.Women with the 4/5 or 5/5 PER3 genotype had a nonstatistically significant 33% increased odds of BrCA. Cases were more likely to have a morning (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.23-4.81) or evening (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.19-5.47) chronotype.Findings are consistent with the possibility that extremes in chronotype may elicit circadian desynchronization, resulting in increased BrCA susceptibility.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903750","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.885792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.825948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.636988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"India","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.417959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Variable number tandem repeat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_number_tandem_repeat"},{"name":"PER3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PER3"},{"name":"Chronotype","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Clock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock"},{"name":"255","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255"},{"name":"249","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/249"},{"name":"234","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/234"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Peru","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Tandem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem"},{"name":"Women in India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_India"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Tandem repeat","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_repeat"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
