{"id":83100,"title":"Acute inferior myocardial infarction in a young male patient associated with Behcet's disease and sildenafil.","abstract":"Behcet's disease (BD) is a multisystemic inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, presenting with mucocutaneous, ocular, articular, vascular, gastrointestinal and central nervous system manifestations. Coronary involvement is very rare in patients with BD. Sildenafil, an oral drug used to treat erectile dysfunction, was shown to cause significant cardiovascular problems including acute myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac death. Acute MI associated with BD and sildenafil has not been reported previously. We present a case of a 23-year-old male patient with an acute inferior MI associated with BD diagnosed after admission of sildenafil, who was successfully treated with thrombus aspiration and tirofiban administration.
