{"id":72564,"title":"Temporal bone carcinoma. Current diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic concepts.","abstract":"Temporal bone carcinoma is an uncommon aggressive malignancy. Its low incidence and the absence of a globally accepted staging system still make it difficult to compare different centers' approaches and results. In this review of the main available studies dealing with temporal bone carcinoma since 1995, we consider its rational preoperative staging and assessment, compare the effectiveness of different treatments by tumor stage, and outline the main actuarial prognostic factors.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24962035","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.828352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.79742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.529661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.398826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Temporal bone","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Actuarial science","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"},{"name":"Rationality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"}]}
