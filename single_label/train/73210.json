{"id":73210,"title":"Synthesis of novel lipoamino acid conjugates of sapienic acid and evaluation of their cytotoxicity activities.","abstract":"Novel lipoamino acids were prepared with the coupling of sapienic acid [(Z)-6-hexadecenoic acid] with ? - amino group of amino acids and the resulting N-sapienoyl amino acids were tested for their cytotoxicity activities against four cancer based cell lines. Initially, sapienic acid was synthesized by the Wittig coupling of triphenylphosphonium bromide salt of 6-bromohexanoic acid and decanal with a Z specific reagent. The prepared sapienic acid was subsequently converted to its acid chloride which was further coupled with amino acids by the Schotten-Baumann reaction to form N-sapienoyl amino acid conjugates. Structural characterization of the prepared N-sapienoyl amino acid derivatives was done by spectral data (IR, mass spectra and NMR). These lipoamino acid derivatives were screened for in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation. Cytotoxicity evaluation against four cancer cell lines showed that N-sapienoyl isoleucine was active against three cell lines whereas other derivatives either showed activity against only one or two cell lines with very moderate activity and two derivatives were observed to be inactive against the tested cell lines.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919473","annotations":[{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.862887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Isoleucine","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.795552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Acyl chloride","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyl_chloride"},{"name":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.699258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.658874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Bromide","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.252072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.247521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.218582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.210579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.164585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Atomic number","weight":0.163079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"},{"name":"Structural biology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Wittig reaction","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittig_reaction"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Neutron moderator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_moderator"},{"name":"Coupling (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(physics)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
