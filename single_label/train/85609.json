{"id":85609,"title":"Burden of asthma among children in a developing megacity: childhood asthma study, Pakistan.","abstract":"Global burden of childhood asthma has increased in the past few decades, particularly in low-income countries. In Pakistan, there is a lack of community-based epidemiological studies estimating the burden of asthma among children. This study determined the prevalence and predictors of asthma among children 3-17 years of age in Karachi, Pakistan.A two-stage community-based representative cross-sectional survey was conducted in Karachi from March 2012 to April 2013 comprising 1046 children aged 3-17 years. Of 7500 clusters, 80 were randomly selected, and of these, 15 children per cluster were enrolled randomly. A translated and pre-tested version of International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children questionnaire was administered.The overall prevalence of asthma among study participants was 10.2% (95% CI: 8.4-12.0). Asthma was more likely to occur among boys (adj. OR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6-4.0), children in the younger age group (3-7 years) (adj. OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.7-4.8), those living in households with ill-ventilated kitchens (adj. OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.1), having family history of asthma (adj. OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3-3.9) and those of the Sindhi ethnicity (adj. OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.4).This study is the first robust evidence regarding asthma among children in Pakistan, reporting a high burden in this group. Family history, male gender, Sindhi ethnicity and ill-ventilated kitchen were identified as important predictors of asthma. Targeted preventive measures and intervention studies are required to better understand and reduce the burden of asthma among children in Pakistan.","date":"2014-10-20","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894743","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.671231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.636827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.61914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.591282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Karachi","weight":0.589693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.566486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.509264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.411754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"History","weight":0.374575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.205524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.16904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0808391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Kitchen","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Megacity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacity"},{"name":"Sindhi language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhi_language"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"1046","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1046"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Inflorescence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Burden, Kansas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden,_Kansas"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
