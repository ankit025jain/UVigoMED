{"id":78300,"title":"Invasive rhinosinusitis by Exserohilum rostratum in an immunocompetent child.","abstract":"Exserohilum is a saprophytic fungal pathogen responsible for a wide spectrum of infections in humans. It causes life-threatening acute invasive infections in the immunocompromised individuals, particularly those having haematological disorders. We report a proven case of chronic invasive rhinosinusitis with orbital involvement by Exserohilum rostratum in an immunocompetent child. The patient responded well to endoscopic sinus surgery followed by oral itraconazole. An aggressive surgical approach is required for improving the outcome of patients with invasive infections. A microbiological diagnosis may help in deciding the systemic antifungal agent in fungal rhinosinusitis.
