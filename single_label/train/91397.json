{"id":91397,"title":"Influence of 1800 MHz GSM-like electromagnetic radiation exposure on fracture healing.","abstract":"In this study, we aimed to investigate whether 1800 MHz frequency electromagnetic radiation (EMR) has an effect on bone healing.A total of 30 Wistar albino rats were divided into two equal groups. Fractures were created in the right tibias of all rats; next, intramedullary fixations with K-wire were performed. A control group (Group I) was kept under the same experimental conditions except without EMR exposure. Rats in Group II were exposed to an 1800 MHz frequency EMR for 30 min a day for 5 days a week. Next, radiological, mechanical, and histological examinations were performed to evaluate tibial fracture healing.Radiological, histological and mechanical scores were not significantly different between groups (respectively, p = 0.114, p = 0.184 and p = 0.083), and all of these scores were lower than those of the controls.EMR at 1800 MHz frequency emitted from cellular phones has no effect on bone fracture healing.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508290","annotations":[{"name":"Electromagnetic radiation","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.761605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.639073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.543828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.538497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Electromagnetism","weight":0.530339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.450955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.418034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.115821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0867165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0574572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"}]}
