{"id":68826,"title":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis presenting as sacral bone metastasis.","abstract":"We present a rare presentation of squamous cell carcinoma of the kidney with chronic low backache. The diagnosis of this uncommon tumour of the renal pelvis was achieved after incidentally detecting a large staghorn calculus, which on further imaging with contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was suggestive of the features of renal tumour with sacral bone lesion. The rarity of this metastatic tumour, with its unusual presentation, is discussed.
