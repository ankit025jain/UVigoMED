{"id":3870,"title":"Development of dog mammary tumor xenograft in immunosuppressed Swiss albino mice.","abstract":"Development and study of dog mammary tumour xenograft in immunosuppressed Swiss Albino Mice adds a new dimension in cancer research as dog tumors have many similarities with human tumors regarding progression, histopathology, molecular mechanism, immune response and therapy. Failure of the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells leads to cancer progression and the fight between immune cells and cancer cells has a great role in understanding the mechanism of cancer progression and elimination. Rejection and acceptance of tumour xenograft depends on efficiency of CD4+, CD8+ and NK cell populations. In the present investigation, dog mammary tumor xenograft in cyclosporine-A and gamma-irradiated, immunosuppressed Swiss Albino mice was developed and the immune cell status of graft accepted and rejected mice was assessed. It was observed that all the major immune cells (CD4+, CD8+ and NK cells) play an equal role in tumour rejection.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345242","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.726851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.712272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.597988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.566775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Mammary tumor","weight":0.373306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_tumor"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.292516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.224121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.216444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Cancer research","weight":0.121605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"}]}
