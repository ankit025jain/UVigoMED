{"id":38213,"title":"Neonatal aspiration: not just meconium.","abstract":"Aspiration of uncontaminated amniotic fluid as a cause of neonatal respiratory distress is scarcely documented. A term neonate who presented with early onset respiratory distress with a radiographic appearance of an aspiration syndrome is therefore reported. Differential diagnosis and implication of this diagnosis in the management of neonatal respiratory distress are discussed. This case highlights amniotic fluid aspiration as a possible cause of severe respiratory distress even in the absence of meconium stained fluid.
