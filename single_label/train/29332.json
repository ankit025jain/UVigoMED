{"id":29332,"title":"Central pontine myelinolysis: electrolytes and beyond.","abstract":"Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), which is a component of the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), is a frequent neurological complication that follows rapid correction of hyponatraemia. However, there are other predisposing risk factors (chronic alcoholism, hypokalaemia) that perpetuate the development of ODS. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman with a history of chronic alcoholism who presented to us with progressive neurological deficits (paraparesis, paresthesias). She was initially detected to have coexisting hypokalaemia which was eventually rectified with potassium supplementation. However, she continued to experience progressive worsening of her neurological symptoms despite adequate potassium supplementation. Therefore, a neurological opinion was sought for and she was diagnosed with CPM based on a background of chronic alcoholism and malnutrition; an MRI of the brain showed a hyperintense signal in the central pontine region. Following the diagnosis of CPM, she was rehabilitated with occupational and physiotherapy.
