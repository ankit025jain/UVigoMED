{"id":62363,"title":"TG1042 (Adenovirus-interferon-?) in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: a phase II clinical trial.","abstract":"While a variety of registered therapies exist for Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma, no such therapy is available for Cutaneous B Cell Therapy. In this context we performed a phase II, open label, multicenter, non-comparative study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of repeated intra-lesional administrations of TG1042 (adenovirus-interferon-?) in patients with relapsing primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL).Thirteen patients have been enrolled and received intralesional injections of TG1042 containing 5Ã—10(10) viral particles into up to six lesions simultaneously. Injections were performed on days 1, 8 and 15 of each of four consecutive 28 day cycles.Eleven (85%) out of 13 enrolled patients showed an objective response after injections of TG1042. Seven patients (54%) exhibited complete and four (31%) displayed partial response. The median time to disease progression in the study population was 23.5 months (range 6.25 to 26+). Most commonly observed adverse events were minor to moderate flu-like symptoms, fatigue and injection site reactions.Our study showed that treatment with TG1042 was associated with a clinical benefit in the majority of the patients with relapsing CBCL, including tumor regression, a clinically meaningful duration of response and a good treatment tolerance.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586226","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.817748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.638815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.610903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.598482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.596657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.449433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Open-label trial","weight":0.148784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-label_trial"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.064482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"1042","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1042"},{"name":"Record label","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Soul Food (Goodie Mob album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Food_(Goodie_Mob_album)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
