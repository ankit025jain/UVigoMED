{"id":4531,"title":"Protective effect of hydrogen sulfide on hyperbaric hyperoxia-induced lung injury in a rat model.","abstract":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is one of the most widely used clinical interventions to counteract insufficient pulmonary oxygen delivery in patients with severe lung injury. However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia leads to inflammation and acute lung injury. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of hydrogen sulfide on hyperbaric hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Rats were intraperitoneally treated with sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) at 28 ?mol/kg immediately before hyperoxia exposure and then exposed to pure oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (atm abs) with continuous ventilation for six hours, Immediately after hyperoxia exposure, rats were sacrificed via anesthesia. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was harvested for the detection of protein concentration and IL-1 content, and the lungs were collected for HE staining, TUNEL staining and detection of wet/dry weight ratio. Our results showed hyperbaric hyperoixa exposure could significantly damage the lung (HE staining), increase the protein and IL-13 in the BALF, elevate the wet/dry Weight ratio and raise the TUNEL positive cells. However, pre-treatment with hydrogen sulfide improved the lung morphology, reduced the TUNEL positive cells and attenuated the lung inflammation (reduction in IL-13 of BALF and HE staining). Taken together, our findings indicate that hydrogen sulfide pretreatment may exert protective effects on hyperbaric hyperoxia-induced lung injury.","date":"2015-01-07","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562948","annotations":[{"name":"Hydrogen sulfide","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Atmosphere (unit)","weight":0.801103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)"},{"name":"Hyperbaric medicine","weight":0.791143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Sulfide","weight":0.691835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfide"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.665902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.583274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.400385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.390213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.356148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Oxygen therapy","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.329587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.258217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.243376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.241325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Hyperoxia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoxia"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Interleukin 13","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13"},{"name":"Acute lung injury","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lung_injury"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Thermodynamic temperature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Harvest (wine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_(wine)"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"}]}
