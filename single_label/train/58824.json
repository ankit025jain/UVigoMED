{"id":58824,"title":"Effect of myrtle fruit syrup on abnormal uterine bleeding: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.","abstract":"Myrtle (Myrtus communis L.) has been used in the Iranian Traditional Medicine as a treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding-menometrorrhagia. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of myrtle fruit syrup on abnormal uterine bleeding-menometrorrhagia.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted on 30 women suffering from abnormal uterine bleeding-menometrorrhagia. Treatment comprised of giving 15 ml oral myrtle syrup daily (5 ml three times a day) for 7 days starting from the onset of bleeding. The myrtle syrup along with placebo was repeated for 3 consecutive menstrual periods. Menstrual duration and number of used pads were recorded by the Pictorial Blood loss Assessment Chart at the end of each menstrual period. The quality of life was also evaluated using the menorrhagia questionnaire.The mean number of bleeding days significantly declined from 10.6?±?2.7 days to 8.2?±?1.9 days after 3 months treatment with the syrup (p?=?0.01) and consequently the participants in the intervention group used fewer pads after 3 months (16.4?±?10.7) compared with the number of pads used at the beginning of the treatment (22.7?±?12.0, p?=?0.01). Bleeding days and number of pads used by the participants in the placebo group did not change significantly. Also significant changes of quality of life scores were observed in the intervention group after 3 months compared to the baseline.Myrtle syrup is introduced as a potential remedy for abnormal uterine bleeding-menometrorrhagia.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888316","annotations":[{"name":"Menorrhagia","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menorrhagia"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.813025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.759622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.742814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.695153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.410411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.349941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.266588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Traditional medicine","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.249403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Dysfunctional uterine bleeding","weight":0.194905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_uterine_bleeding"},{"name":"Vaginal bleeding","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_bleeding"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Myrtaceae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtaceae"},{"name":"Myrtus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtus"},{"name":"Fruit syrup","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_syrup"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"410","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/410"},{"name":"712","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/712"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Sanitary napkin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_napkin"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Syrup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrup"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"}]}
