{"id":12407,"title":"Inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase prevents angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis in vitro.","abstract":"Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS)-catalysed isoprenoid intermediates are important for the activation of Ras homologue gene family, member A (RhoA) in angiotensin (Ang) II-induced cardiac fibrosis. This study was designed to investigate the specific role of FPPS in the development of cardiac fibrosis. We demonstrated that FPPS expression was elevated in both in-vivo and in-vitro models of Ang II-mediated cardiac fibrosis. FPPS inhibition by zolendronate and FPPS knock-down by a silencing lentivirus decreased the expression of cardiac fibrosis marker genes, including collagen I, collagen III and transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1. FPPS inhibition was reversed by geranylgeraniol (GGOH) and mimicked by RhoA knock-down with siRhoA. The antagonistic effect of GGOH on the zolendronate-mediated modulation of RhoA activation in Ang II-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts was demonstrated by a pull-down assay. Furthermore, FPPS knock-down also prevented RhoA activation by Ang II?in vitro. In conclusion, FPPS and RhoA may be part of a signalling pathway that plays an important role in Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis in vitro.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24527834","annotations":[{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.865157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Terpenoid","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpenoid"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.772276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.64443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.620865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"RHOA","weight":0.456138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RHOA"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.218346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Pyrophosphate","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Gene family","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_family"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.124446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.111378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Farnesyl pyrophosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnesyl_pyrophosphate"},{"name":"Collagen, type III, alpha 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen,_type_III,_alpha_1"},{"name":"Cardiac fibrosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_fibrosis"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Farnesol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnesol"},{"name":"Reaction intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
