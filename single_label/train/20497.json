{"id":20497,"title":"Comparison of tuberculosis infection rates in a national database of renal transplant patients with data from a single center in Taiwan.","abstract":"Successful renal transplantation (RT) improves quality of life and patient survival. Advances in immunosuppressants for RT have improved the prevention and treatment of acute rejection as well as reduced the risk of chronic graft damage, but immunodeficiency may render patients vulnerable to opportunistic infections. We conducted this study to compare the difference in tuberculosis (TB) infection rates between a single institution and a national database of RT recipients in Taiwan. There were 153 patients with TB (3.2%) among 4,835 RT recipients in the database during the period 2000-2009, with a higher prevalence of men (P = .018) and diabetes patients (P = .029). In our institution's registry, 33 patients (2.7%) developed 35 episodes of TB infection among 1,209 RT recipients, but there were no significant differences in general characteristics among different subgroups. Interestingly, the use of cyclosporine was significantly more frequent in RT recipients with TB than in those without in both the national database and in our institution. In contrast, TB infection was negatively correlated with the use of tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate (MPA). RT recipients with TB infection had poor survival (P = .0013) and low graft survival (P = .0003). Taken together, analyses of the national database and the RT patients in our institution revealed that the use of long-term cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive agents was associated with a greater risk of developing post-transplantation TB compared with that of other immunosuppressive agents, but the chronicity and accumulation effect of TAC and MPA should be observed despite the negative correlation found herein. In conclusion, post-transplantation TB is a serious health threat and one of the major causes of death among RT recipients, and a high index of suspicion to ensure early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment for TB is crucial. The use of optimal immunosuppressive agents to minimize acute rejection, monitoring of high-risk recipients, prompt diagnosis, and appropriate treatment are required to manage TB infection in endemic areas such as Taiwan.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656019","annotations":[{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.806616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.802299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Opportunistic infection","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.693722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.597982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.544019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.511853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.11992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
