{"id":45554,"title":"A novel semiautomatic parenchyma extraction method for improved MRI R2* relaxometry of iron loaded liver.","abstract":"To propose and evaluate an automatic method of extracting parenchyma from a manually delineated whole liver for the R2* measurement of iron load.In all, 108 transfusion-dependent patients with a wide range of hepatic iron content were scanned with a multiecho gradient-echo sequence. The R2* was measured by fitting the average signal of liver parenchyma, extracted by the proposed semiautomatic parenchyma extraction (SAPE), traditional manually delineated multiple regions-of-interest (mROIs), and T2* thresholding methods to the noise-corrected monoexponential model. The R2* measurement accuracy of the SAPE method was evaluated through simulation; the intra- and interobserver reproducibility of SAPE, mROI, and T2* thresholding were assessed from the in vivo data using coefficient of variation (CoV).In the simulation, the mean absolute percentage error of R2* measurement using SAPE was 0.23% (range 0.01%-1.09%). In vivo study, the CoVs of intra- and interobserver reproducibility were 0.83%, 1.39% for SAPE, 3.63%, 6.28% for mROI, and 1.62%, 2.66% for T2* thresholding, respectively.The SAPE method provides an accurate and reliable approach to assessing the overall hepatic iron content. The improved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) R2* reproducibility using the SAPE method may lead to more accurate tissue characterization and increased diagnostic confidence.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677406","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.43536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.324742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.312002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.290997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.256982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.252013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.248919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.14988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Coefficient of variation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation"},{"name":"Mean absolute percentage error","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0239857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Absolute value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Data mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Surrealist automatism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_automatism"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Automatic transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"},{"name":"Semi-automatic firearm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_firearm"},{"name":"Approximation error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_error"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Heaviside step function","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function"}]}
