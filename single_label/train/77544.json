{"id":77544,"title":"[Ergonomic movement in dentistry].","abstract":"'Ergonomic movement in dentistry' is a recently developed ergonomic programme for dental healthcare professionals which is intended to prevent work-related complaints and assist in recovering from them. The programme is recommended by disability insurers in cases of specific physical complaints, limitations or disability, as a consequence of which a dental healthcare professional is unable to carry out his or her work. In a four-day training programme, in one's own workplace, skills are taught in the areas of work organization, work attitude and movement. These skills are directly applied in the treatment ofpatients and, if necessary, further improved. In this way, one advances step by step to an ergonomic way of working. Evaluations have shown that the programme is advantageous for the attitude toward work, the workplace and the work organization as well as the reduction of disability.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640298","annotations":[{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.760806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.578346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.487259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.46357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Health care industry","weight":0.433841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_industry"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.317857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Strowger switch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strowger_switch"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0132537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
