{"id":88518,"title":"Monte Carlo simulations for assessment of organ radiation doses and cancer risk in patients undergoing abdominal stent-graft implantation.","abstract":"The aim of this work was to assess absorbed radiation doses in selected organs and to estimate cancer and mortality risks in patients undergoing abdominal stent-graft implantation, as a function of age, gender, and anatomical parameters of patients' aneurysms and arteries.297 patients (266 males and 31 females) underwent endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) with abdominal stent-graft implantation. Kerma-area products Gy-cm(2) for all implanted patients were collected retrospectively. Entrance surface air kerma (ESAK), doses absorbed by selected organs, and cancer/mortality risks were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation methods (CALDose_X software).The highest radiation doses were deposited in the skin, gallbladder wall, and colon wall. The highest average cancer risk was found for the youngest group of patients (<60 years old; 1:275) and the lowest for the oldest (>70 years old, 1:735). The radiation-induced risk of cancer mortality (mortality risk) was about 40% lower than radiation-induced cancer occurrence risk. Aneurysm neck angulations >45° had a significant impact on ESAK, as well as increasing cancer and mortality risks.The main factors increasing cancer risk are young age and aneurysm neck angulations >45°, which determines the difficulty of proper stent-graft placement. However, the radiation risk associated with the stent-graft implantation procedure is relatively low, and EVAR should not be avoided.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24835076","annotations":[{"name":"Skin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.742567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.629539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.540145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Monte Carlo method","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.378002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.258297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"735","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/735"},{"name":"275","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/275"},{"name":"266","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/266"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
