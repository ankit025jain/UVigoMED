{"id":46385,"title":"Clinical, biochemical and pathological profiles of 5464 Egyptian chronic hepatitis C-infected patients.","abstract":"In Egypt, hepatitis C virus (HC is highly endemic with at least 91% are genotype-4. However, HCV-specific burden data for Egypt are scarce. The study aims to identify clinical, biochemical and pathological features of chronic HCV population in Egypt.We analyzed retrospective data of 5,464 HCV-antibody and PCR positive patients attending pre-treatment assessment at one of the National Treatment Centers, Cairo, Egypt.Chronic HCV patients were males (81.4%) in their productive age, mean body mass index (BMI): 28 kg/m2. Laboratory profile demonstrated mean platelet count 214 x 10(3)/Âµ L with only 14% having thrombocytopenia, amino-transferases were mildly elevated: mean AST, ALT were 56 and 63 respectively,low viraemia: 50% had viral load <100 (x 10(3)) IU/mL,and median AFP level 3.3 ng/mL. Liver biopsy revealed ?A2 in 92% of patients; 80% had ?F2 and 7.3 % had F4 according to the METAVIR score. Meta regression demonstrated that advanced stages of fibrosis were significantly correlated with platelet count, AST/ALT ratio, AFP levels and BMI (p <0.001). However there was no correlation with viral load.To our knowledge, this is the first study on nationwide scale that provided the demographic, biochemical,and histological characteristics for this number of chronic HCV patients presumably genotype-4.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634943","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.760749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.735098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.682719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.63972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.586829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.579805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.564624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.422191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Ancient Egypt","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Cairo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.0250317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
