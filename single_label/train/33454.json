{"id":33454,"title":"Treatment of congenital thoracic scoliosis with associated rib fusions using VEPTR expansion thoracostomy: a surgical technique.","abstract":"Untreated growing patients with congenital scoliosis and fused ribs will develop finally thoracic insufficiency syndrome. The technique of expansion thoracoplasty with implantation of a vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) was introduced initially to treat these children.This article attempts to provide an overview of the surgical technique of opening-wedge thoracostomy and VEPTR instrumentation in children with congenital thoracic scoliosis and fused ribs.Our modification of the surgical approach using a posterior midline incision rather than the modified thoracotomy incision initially described could potentially help to diminish wound dehiscence and secondary infection, while preserving a more acceptable esthetic appearance of the back.Vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib-based treatments should be undertaken only with a good knowledge of its numerous specific complications. Every aspect of the treatment should be oriented to minimize these complications. At the same time it should be kept in mind that the ultimate step of this long-term fusionless treatment strategy will be a technically demanding spine fusion.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24823848","annotations":[{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.741285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.700354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.382994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.328352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Thoracic surgery","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.100392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Mod (video gaming)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_gaming)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Fusion (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_(music)"},{"name":"Commissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissure"},{"name":"Wound dehiscence","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_dehiscence"}]}
