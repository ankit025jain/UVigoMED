{"id":44786,"title":"Follow-up outcomes of endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer with undifferentiated histology.","abstract":"The application of endoscopic resection (ER) for undifferentiated-type early gastric cancer (UD-EGC) remains controversial. The aim was to examine long-term outcomes of ER for UD-EGC. Furthermore, we investigated whether long-term outcomes of ER differed between poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (PD) and signet ring cell carcinoma (SRC).From 2001 to 2011, 209 lesions in 209 patients with UD-EGC (82 PD; 127 SRC) were treated by ER. We retrospectively assessed the clinical outcomes of ER in 209 patients. The survival rate and disease-free survival rates after ER were evaluated as long-term outcomes.The en bloc resection and curative resection (CR) rates were 91.4 and 55.0 %, respectively. The en bloc and CR rates in PD were 90.2 and 45.1 %, whereas those in SRC were 92.1 and 61.4 %. For patients with PD who underwent non-curative resections, 51.1 % were vertical-cut end-positive and for those with SRC, 63.3 % were lateral-cut end-positive, a statistically significant difference. In those patients where CR was achieved, no case of local recurrence or distant metastasis was observed during the follow-up period (32.7 ± 22.2 months). The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 99.0 and 98.6 %, with no significant difference between CR patients with SRC and PD.ER may yield good long-term outcomes for UD-EGC if CR is achieved, with no difference between PD and SRC. However, to increase the current CR rate of ER, stricter criteria for performing ER in UD-EGC may be required.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24718663","annotations":[{"name":"Signet ring cell carcinoma","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.864676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.711061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.581475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.23813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.149621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Signet ring cell","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring_cell"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Signet ring","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Eastern Bloc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"Monobloc engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monobloc_engine"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"}]}
