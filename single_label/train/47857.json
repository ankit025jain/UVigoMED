{"id":47857,"title":"Clinical outcomes of second-look endoscopy after gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection: predictive factors with high risks of bleeding.","abstract":"A second-look endoscopy is routinely performed after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in many institutions, although the need is questionable. Additional hemostatic procedures might be necessary for the post-ESD ulcer with a high risk of bleeding. We investigated the predictive factors for post-ESD ulcers with a high risk of bleeding.Second-look endoscopy was performed on the day following ESD. The post-ESD ulcers were categorized into two risk groups according to the Forrest classification: high-risk ulcer stigma (type I and IIa) and low-risk ulcer stigma. We analyzed the risk factors associated with high-risk ulcer stigma and late delayed bleeding.During the study period, 616 ESD procedures were performed. Second-look endoscopy revealed that the incidence of high-risk ulcer stigma post-ESD was 15.1%. Early and late delayed bleeding rates were 3.7 and 1.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that submucosal fibrosis and nausea were significantly related to high-risk ulcer stigma after ESD. Multivariate analysis revealed that surface erosion, location of the lesion, and high-risk ulcer stigma identified by second-look endoscopy were significantly associated with late delayed bleeding.The effective use of selective second-look endoscopy will help limit unnecessary procedures. Submucosal fibrosis and nausea were risk factors associated with high-risk ulcer stigma after ESD.","date":"2014-06-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24570014","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.698854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.540779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.469515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.11268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Electrostatic discharge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge"},{"name":"FAA airport categories","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAA_airport_categories"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"}]}
