{"id":50699,"title":"Comparison of crude and age-specific incidence rates of breast, ovary, endometrium and cervix cancers in Iran, 2005.","abstract":"Cancer accounts for 12.6% of total deaths in the world (just after heart disease).Frequency and age-specific incidence rates of breast and gynecologic cancers in Iran are calculated based on the dataset of the National Cancer Registry of Iran in 2005.Gynecologic and breast cancer accounted for 7.6% and 25.6% of total cancer cases, respectively. Ovarian cancer was the most frequent gynecologic cancer followed by endometrium. Endometrial cancer revealed the highest age specific incidence rate followed by ovary (after 59 years).Regarding disease burden, breast and gynecologic cases account for 33.4% of total cancer patients. The age specific incidence rate is a useful guide in epidemiologic and future plans.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761847","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Gynecologic oncology","weight":0.62554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecologic_oncology"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.282569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
