{"id":30811,"title":"Alcohol-induced liver injury is modulated by Nlrp3 and Nlrc4 inflammasomes in mice.","abstract":"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by increased hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) and inflammation with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Two of these cytokines, interleukin-1 ? (IL-1 ? ) and IL-18, require activation of caspase-1 via members of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. These NLRs form an inflammasome that is activated by pathogens and signals released through local tissue injury or death. NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (Nlrp3) and NLR family CARD domain containing protein 4 (Nlrc4) have been studied minimally for their role in the development of ALD. Using mice with gene targeted deletions for Nlrp3 (Nlrp3(-/-)) and Nlrc4 (Nlrc4(-/-)), we analyzed the response to chronic alcohol consumption. We found that Nlrp3(-/-) mice have more severe liver injury with higher plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, increased activation of IL-18, and reduced activation of IL-1B. In contrast, the Nlrc4(-/-) mice had similar alcohol-induced liver injury compared to C57BL/6J (B6) mice but had greatly reduced activation of IL-1 ? . This suggests that Nlrp3 and Nlrc4 inflammasomes activate IL-1 ? and IL-18 via caspase-1 in a differential manner. We conclude that the Nlrp3 inflammasome is protective during alcohol-induced liver injury.
