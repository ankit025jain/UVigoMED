{"id":27937,"title":"Older people and alcohol use.","abstract":"The proportion of older people drinking alcohol above the recommended levels has been increasing in the UK. Alcohol dependency and misuse can lead to various physical and psychological problems for older people. A range of factors can influence alcohol dependency and misuse among older adults, which need careful consideration when interventions are being developed to reduce consumption. Interventions to reduce alcohol consumption among older people can include: home visits, telephone support, mentoring, one-to-one and group programmes, family and community engagement programmes, outreach programmes, and targeted support groups focused on education and social activities. There is a need for the training of community nurses focused on improving the detection (screening and assessment), treatment and service provision for older people.
