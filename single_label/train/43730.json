{"id":43730,"title":"Sorafenib enhances effects of transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"Combination therapy of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) showed benefits for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This systematic review aims for evaluation of efficacy and safety between sorafenib plus TACE and TACE alone for HCC.We systematically searched multi-databases to identify eligible studies. Studies comparing sorafenib combined with TACE and TACE alone for HCC were included.Nine studies with 900 patients (sorafenib + TACE = 446, TACE = 454) were finally included. Sorafenib combined with TACE significantly reduced 6-month mortality [OR 0.24, 95 % confidential interval (CI) 0.09-0.68, P = 0.007] and 1-year mortality (OR 0.35, 95 % CI 0.21-0.56, P < 0.0001), but did not decrease 2-year mortality (OR 0.58, 95 % CI 0.14-2.46, P = 0.46). Although combination therapy tend to reduce 3-month (OR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.52-1.10, P = 0.15) and 6-month progression free rate (OR 0.27, 95 % CI 0.07-1.05, P = 0.06), the changes were not significant. Additionally, objective response ratio (OR 0.39, 95 % CI 0.19-0.78, P = 0.008) and clinical benefit ratio (OR 0.27, 95 % CI 0.15-0.50, P < 0.0001) also favored for combination therapy, which, however, caused higher morbidity, especially hand-foot skin reaction (OR 53.71, 95 % CI 28.86-99.93, P < 0.00001), hematological events (OR 14.8, 95 % CI 6.07-36.07, P < 0.00001), diarrhea (OR 6.62, 95 % CI 3.82-11.45, P < 0.00001), hypertension (OR 5.03, 95 % CI 3.02-8.38, P < 0.00001), rash/desquamation (OR 5.67, 95 % CI 3.58-8.99, P < 0.00001), and fatigue (OR 2.5, 95 % CI 1.09-5.72, P = 0.03).Combination of sorafenib and TACE showed survival and clinical benefits in patients with HCC, though enhanced morbidity.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770582","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.709411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.688483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sorafenib","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorafenib"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.142224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Confidentiality","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"446","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/446"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
