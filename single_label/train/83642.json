{"id":83642,"title":"Resistance of non-transgenic papaya plants to papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) mediated by intron-containing hairpin dsRNAs expressed in bacteria.","abstract":"RNA-mediated virus resistance based on natural antiviral RNA silencing has been exploited as a powerful tool for engineering virus resistance in plants. In this study, a conserved 3'-region (positions 9839-10117, 279 nt) of the capsid protein (CP) gene of papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), designated CP279, was used to generate an intron-containing hairpin RNA (ihpRNA) construct by one-step, zero-background ligation-independent cloning (OZ-LIC). The RNaseIII-deficient Escherichia coli strain M-JM109lacY was identified as the best choice for producing large quantities of specific ihpRNA-CP279. Resistance analyses and ELISA data verified that most papaya plants mechanically co-inoculated with TRIzol-extracted ihpRNA-CP279 and PRSV were resistant to PRSV, and resistance was maintained throughout the test period (>2 months post-inoculation). In contrast, a 1-2 day interval between sequential inoculation of PRSV and ihpRNA-CP279 did not result in complete protection against PRSV infection, but delayed the appearance of viral symptoms by 3 to 4 days. These findings indicate that direct mechanical inoculation of papaya plants with bacterially-expressed ihpRNA-CP279 targeting the PRSV CP gene can interfere with virus infection. This work lays a foundation for developing a non-transgenic approach to control PRSV by directly spraying plants with ihpRNA or crude bacterial extract preparations.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25283861","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Capsid","weight":0.851443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.812922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.73549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Conserved sequence","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conserved_sequence"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.724129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Stem-loop","weight":0.709257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.629057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.193782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Papaya ringspot virus","weight":0.0822457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaya_ringspot_virus"},{"name":"Carica papaya","weight":0.0739124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carica_papaya"},{"name":"Virus latency","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_latency"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
