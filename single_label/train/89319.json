{"id":89319,"title":"Flap reconstruction of the elbow and forearm: a case-based approach.","abstract":"Elbow and forearm wounds have distinct reconstructive requirements, but both require a durable and pliable solution. Pedicle, free fasciocutaneous and muscle, and distant (2-stage) flaps have a role in wound reconstruction in these unique areas. This article presents practical surgical cases as a guide to soft tissue reconstruction of the elbow and forearm.
