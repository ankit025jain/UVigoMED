{"id":1724,"title":"Four-point molding: a new cast molding technique for closed reduction treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip.","abstract":"In order to achieve added stability in a hip spica cast and decrease unnecessary open reduction, the authors have devised a new hip spica cast molding technique that has been named, \"Four-point molding technique\". Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of this technique, in terms of its ability to deliver a stable, concentric reduction of the hip.The authors retrospectively reviewed the patients, aged 6-24 months, that were diagnosed with DDH and who had undergone closed reduction with a hip spica cast. The authors used the four-point molding technique on all patients. The authors evaluated radiographs for redislocation during the 12 weeks of cast treatment and followed-up to 1 year after hip spica cast removal. 15 children (15 hips) who were treated over a 14-year period were included in the present study to determine the success rate ofthis procedure.From 1996-2010, there were 15 unilateral DDH patients who were treated with the four-point molding technique. The average age of the patients at the time of the reduction was 17 months (age range: 8-23 months). The treatment was 86.6% successful in 13 children (95% CI 0.62-0.96). The average duration in the hip spica cast was 12.5 weeks. Mean follow-up was 23.1 months. Two children were unable to be concentrically reduced with sufficient stability with closed reduction and therefore required open reduction and osteotomy.Four-point molding is simple, gives good result, and with low complications. The authors propose this technique for use in closed reduction treatmentfor DDH.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25365886","annotations":[{"name":"Hip","weight":0.246439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Orthopedic cast","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_cast"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0827627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.024844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"624","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/624"},{"name":"823","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/823"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Bond duration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_duration"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Molding (decorative)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molding_(decorative)"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"}]}
