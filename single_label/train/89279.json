{"id":89279,"title":"External fixation of the thalamic portion of a fractured calcaneus: a new surgical technique.","abstract":"The optimal treatment for intra-articular calcaneus fractures remains controversial, despite internal fixation techniques providing good results. The major point of contention is the need to reconstruct the overall morphology versus to restore the anatomy of the subtalar joint perfectly. We will describe a two-stage technique for treating intra-articular calcaneus fractures in which the primary fracture line goes through the thalamic fragment. The first procedure focuses on the overall morphology by restoring the height and length with osteotaxis being accomplished with a medial external fixator. The second procedure consists of internal fixation through a minimally invasive lateral approach to restore the anatomy of the articular facets. Any defects are filled with injectable bone substitute. This novel technique is compared to the complication rates and radiology and anatomy outcomes in published studies. This two-stage surgical technique reduces the length of hospital stays and the number of complications.
