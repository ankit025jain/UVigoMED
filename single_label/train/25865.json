{"id":25865,"title":"Aspirin treatment and outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention: results of the ISAR-ASPI registry.","abstract":"Aspirin administration, as part of a dual antiplatelet treatment regimen, is essential for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although the correlation between high on-clopidogrel treatment platelet reactivity (HCPR) and clinical outcome is well established, data for high on-aspirin treatment platelet reactivity (HAPR) are conflicting.The aim of the ISAR-ASPI (Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen-ASpirin and Platelet Inhibition) registry was to assess the value of HAPR as a possible prognostic biomarker in PCI-treated patients with regard to clinical outcome.From February 2007 to May 2013, we identified 7,090 consecutive PCI-treated patients with measured on-aspirin treatment platelet aggregation values directly before PCI. Platelet function was assessed with a Multiplate analyzer. The primary endpoint was death or stent thrombosis (ST) at 1 year.The upper quintile of patients (n = 1,414), according to Multiplate measurements, was defined as the HAPR cohort. Compared with non-HAPR patients (n = 5,676), HAPR patients showed a significantly higher risk of death or ST at 1 year (6.2% vs. 3.7%, respectively; odds ratio [OR]: 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39 to 2.27; p < 0.0001). HAPR was found to be an independent predictor of the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj]: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.89; p = 0.005).HAPR, measured at the time point of the PCI, is associated with a higher risk for death or ST during the first year after PCI. Present data are in support of the addition of HAPR to a panel of prognostic biomarkers in PCI-treated patients.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25169169","annotations":[{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.882119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.817003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.693752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.454422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.3941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.377274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.363355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.359426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.31342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.250358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0678564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.066561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Platelet aggregation","weight":0.0539162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_aggregation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"414","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/414"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Sixth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_grade"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Regimen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimen"},{"name":"Analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyser"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Antithrombotic","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithrombotic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
