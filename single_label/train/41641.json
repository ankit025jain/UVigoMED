{"id":41641,"title":"Simeprevir with pegylated interferon alfa 2a plus ribavirin in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection (QUEST-1): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"Although the addition of the HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir to pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa plus ribavirin has improved sustained virological response (SVR) in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, the regimens have a high pill burden and are associated with increased rates and severity of adverse events, such as anaemia and rash. The efficacy and safety of the combination of simeprevir, a one pill, once-daily, oral HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor, plus peginterferon alfa 2a plus ribavirin were assessed in treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 infection.Treatment with simeprevir, peginterferon alfa 2a, and ribavirin was superior to placebo, peginterferon alfa 2a, and ribavirin (SVR12 in 210 [80%] patients of 264 vs 65 [50%] of 130, respectively, adjusted difference 29路3% [95% CI 20路1-38路6; p<0路0001). Adverse events in the first 12 weeks of treatment led to discontinuation of simeprevir in two (<1%) patients and discontinuation of placebo in one patient (<1%); fatigue (106 [40%] vs 49 [38%] patients, respectively) and headache (81 [31%] vs 48 [37%], respectively) were the most common adverse events. The prevalences of anaemia (42 [16%] vs 14 [11%], respectively) and rash (72 [27%] vs 33 [25%]) were similar in the simeprevir and placebo groups. Addition of simeprevir did not increase severity of patient-reported fatigue and functioning limitations, but shortened their duration.Simeprevir once daily with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin shortens therapy in treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 infection without worsening the adverse event profiles associated with peginterferon alfa 2a plus ribavirin.Janssen Infectious Diseases-Diagnostics.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907225","annotations":[{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Polypharmacy","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypharmacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.680583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.625212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.534623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Boceprevir","weight":0.338355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boceprevir"},{"name":"Telaprevir","weight":0.178789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telaprevir"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Combined oral contraceptive pill","weight":0.114428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.0439684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Nova Scotia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia"},{"name":"Janssen Pharmaceutica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janssen_Pharmaceutica"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
