{"id":56800,"title":"The spatial profile of macular pigment in subjects from a Singapore Chinese population.","abstract":"To examine the spatial profile of macular pigment (MP) and its relationship with serum concentrations of lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) in subjects from a Singapore Chinese population.In this cross-sectional study, the following details were recorded in 95 healthy subjects: sociodemographic, lifestyle information, body mass index (BMI), visual acuity, MP spatial profile using a macular densitometer, and serum L and Z.The mean (SD) age of the population was 42.40 (± 13) years, ranging from 21 to 68 years. Females demonstrated significantly lower MP optical density (MPOD) than males (MPOD: females = 0.52 ± 0.17; males = 0.61 ± 0.21, P = 0.03). MP spatial profile was typical and atypical with central dip in 68 (85%) and 12 (15%) subjects, respectively. Age and BMI were found to be significant predictors for atypical MP spatial profile (age: odds ratio, OR = 1.06, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.01-1.13, P = 0.04; BMI: OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.01-1.34, P = 0.03). A positive relationship was observed between MPOD and serum concentrations of L and Z, but only the latter relationship reached statistical significance (serum L: r = 0.12, P = 0.30; serum Z: r = 0.26, P = 0.02).A central dip in MP spatial profile was observed with older age and higher BMI, the two known risk factors for AMD, suggesting that atypical MP spatial profile may be associated with an increased risk of AMD. Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm these observations.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627145","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.795452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.557058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"China","weight":0.490842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Singapore","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Advanced Micro Devices","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices"},{"name":"Lutein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutein"},{"name":"Densitometer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densitometer"},{"name":"Zeaxanthin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeaxanthin"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Absorbance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbance"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Atomic number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Direct relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_relationship"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
