{"id":19189,"title":"Decreased infection rates following total joint arthroplasty in a large county run teaching hospital: a single surgeon's experience and possible solution.","abstract":"Total joint arthroplasty is a common orthopaedic procedure producing valuable improvements in patient's quality of life. A dreaded complication of this procedure is deep seated, periprosthetic infection. This complication can lead to multiple reoperations and upwards of $100,000 of increased cost burden. At one 900 bed county run teaching hospital, with a historically high infection rate in total joints, the total joint service was closed and restarted using a new protocol, dropping infection rates from 12.9% to 1.9% (P = 0.007).","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736290","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.587247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.417041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.35754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.345704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.265375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.141968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"County","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Joint warfare","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_warfare"},{"name":"Salmson 9","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmson_9"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
