{"id":22216,"title":"Systematic review and meta-analysis on the utility of Interferon-gamma release assays for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in children: a 2013 update.","abstract":"Previous meta-analyses regarding the performance of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for tuberculosis diagnosis in children yielded contrasting results, probably due to different inclusion/exclusion criteria.We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases and calculated pooled estimates of sensitivities and specificities of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-G-IT), T-SPOT.TB, and tuberculin skin test (TST). Several sub-analysis were performed: stratification by background (low income vs. high income countries); including only microbiological confirmed TB cases; including only studies performing a simultaneous three-way comparison of the three tests, and including immunocompromised children.Overall, 31 studies (6183 children) for QFT-G-IT, 14 studies (2518 children) for T-SPOT.TB and 34 studies (6439 children) for TST were included in the analyses. In high income countries QFT-G-IT sensitivity was 0.79 (95%IC: 0.75-0.82) considering all the studies, 0.78 (95%CI:0.70-0.84) including only studies performing a simultaneous three-way comparison and 0.86 (95%IC 0.81-0.90) considering only microbiologically confirmed studies. In the same analyses T-SPOT.TB sensitivity was 0.67 (95%IC 0.62-0.73); 0.76 (95%CI: 0.68 to 0.83); and 0.79 (95%IC 0.69-0.87), respectively. In low income countries QFT-G-IT pooled sensitivity was significantly lower: 0.57 (95%IC:0.52-0.61), considering all the studies, and 0.66 (95%IC 0.55-0.76) considering only microbiologically confirmed cases; while T-SPOT.TB sensitivity was 0.61 (95%IC 0.57-0.65) overall, but reached 0.80 (95%IC 0.73-0.86) in microbiologically confirmed cases. In microbiologically confirmed cases TST sensitivity was similar: 0.86 (95%IC 0.79-0.91) in high income countries, and 0.74 (95%IC 0.68-0.80) in low income countries. Higher IGRAs specificity with respect to TST was observed in high income countries (97-98% vs. 92%) but not in low income countries (85-93% vs. 90%).Both IGRAs showed no better performance than TST in low income countries.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564486","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Tuberculosis diagnosis","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Mantoux test","weight":0.769106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.716871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.540992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.482633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Tuberculin","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculin"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.318165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.231296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"London Underground","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground"},{"name":"810","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/810"},{"name":"790","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/790"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"570","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/570"},{"name":"680","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/680"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"730","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/730"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Winning percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Threesome","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threesome"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"First World","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World"}]}
