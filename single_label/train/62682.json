{"id":62682,"title":"Real-time contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging of focal splenic lesions.","abstract":"To investigate the imaging features of focal splenic lesions (FSLs) on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).Thirty two patients with FSLs proved by pathology were retrospectively analyzed. CEUS was performed using intravenous bolus injection of 2.4 ml sulfur hexafluoride-filled microbubble contrast agent and real time scanning. There were hemangioma (n=7), lymphoma (n=8), true cyst (n=3), infarction (n=4), hematolymphangioma (n=2), metastasis tumor (n=2), and one for each of the following entities extramedullary hemopoiesis, hamartoma, tuberculosis, Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, inflammatory pseudotumor and myxofibrosarcoma.Among 21 benign lesions, 4 infarctions and 3 cysts presented non-enhancement throughout CEUS scanning, and the other 14 lesions displayed various enhancement levels with 6 (42.9%) hyper-enhancement, 2 (14.3%) iso-enhancement and 6 (42.9%) hypo-enhancement in arterial phase and 11 (78.6%) hypo-enhancement, 1 (7.1%) iso-enhancement and 2 (14.3%) hyper-enhancement in late phase, respectively. The enhancement pattern included 9 (64.3%) homogeneous, 4 (28.6%) heterogeneous and 1 (7.1%) rim-like enhancement. As for the malignant FSLs, all the lesions became completely or extensively hypo-enhancement during the late phase no matter their vascularity during arterial phase.The CEUS features reported in this series may enrich the knowledge for CEUS characterization of FSLs.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529592","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Langerhans cell","weight":0.87691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell"},{"name":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell_histiocytosis"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Hamartoma","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.771039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.732099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.646739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.615169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.568112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sulfur","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur"},{"name":"Histiocytosis","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocytosis"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0495813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
