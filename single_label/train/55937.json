{"id":55937,"title":"Transactivation of EGF receptors in chicken Müller cells by ?2A-adrenergic receptors stimulated by brimonidine.","abstract":"Alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonists are used in glaucoma treatment and have been shown to have some neuroprotective effects. We performed this study to test the hypothesis that epidermal growth factor receptors on chicken Müller cells are transactivated by ?2-adrenergic receptors and we focused on the extracellular signal-activated kinases 1/2 (ERK) pathway.Embryonic chicken retina and cultures of primary Müller cells were stimulated by ?2-adrenergic receptor agonist brimonidine. Immunostaining, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot techniques, in combination with Src, epidermal growth factor receptor kinase, and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, were used for analysis of the cellular responses.Our results showed that Müller cells express ?2A-adrenergic receptors in vivo and in vitro and that brimonidine triggered a robust and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This ERK-response was Src-kinase dependent, associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptors (phospho-Y1068, Y1173) and was mediated by matrix metalloproteinase activity on the Müller cells.Müller cells express the ?2A-adrenergic receptor, and brimonidine triggers both Src-kinase- and matrix metalloproteinase-mediated autocrine ligand-dependent activation of epidermal growth factor receptors on Müller cells. This response is consistent with transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptors by stimulation of ?2-adrenergic receptors.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781942","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Autocrine signalling","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocrine_signalling"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.79151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.725421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"MAPK/ERK pathway","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Transactivation","weight":0.646976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactivation"},{"name":"Adrenergic receptor","weight":0.57761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.567702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.531077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.495641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.379565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.137124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Adrenergic","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenergic"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
