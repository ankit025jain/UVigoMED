{"id":61476,"title":"Prevalence of hematological abnormalities and malnutrition in HIV-infected under five children in Enugu.","abstract":"Hematological abnormalities such as anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occur in children infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These abnormalities are due to myelosuppression caused by the HIV and contribute to the morbidity and mortality of HIV-infected children. Malnutrition is prominent in HIV-infected children due to associated conditions such as oropharyngeal candidiasis, diarrhea, and cytokine production which result in poor intake, nutrient loss, and increased metabolic rate, respectively.To determine the prevalence of hematological abnormalities (using the World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions) and malnutrition in HIV-infected children receiving care at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu.The hematological and anthropometric indices of HIV-infected children between 18 and 59 months were assessed. Their hemoglobin level, neutrophil, and platelet counts were the hematological profiles evaluated using the WHO case definitions in HIV clinical staging. The weight-for-height z-score index was used to assess the nutritional status of subjects using the WHO reference ranges. The t-test, Chi-square, and Pearson correlation coefficient were used for statistical analysis.There were 67 HIV positive children: 34 males and 33 females, aged 18-59 months. The mean hematological levels of subjects were hemoglobin (Hb) 10.4 ± 1.2 g/dl, neutrophil count 3,031 ± 1,039 cells/mm 3 , platelets count 294 ± 78 × 109/L. Two children (3.0%) had anemia (hemoglobin < 8 gm/dl) and were severely immunosuppressed, on highly active antiretroviral therapy treatment and had advanced HIV disease (clinical stage 3). Children who were malnourished were 15 (22.4%).Hematological abnormalities and malnutrition occur in HIV positive children.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714007","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Bone marrow suppression","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_suppression"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.851497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Candidiasis","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.68318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.676988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Basal metabolic rate","weight":0.572992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.554832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Reference ranges for blood tests","weight":0.482128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.45759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.422886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.204285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"}]}
