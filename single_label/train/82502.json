{"id":82502,"title":"The role of xerostomia in burning mouth syndrome: a case-control study.","abstract":"To assess the efficacy of anti-xerostomic topical medication (urea 10%) in patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS).Thirty-eight subjects diagnosed with BMS according to the International Association for the Study of Pain guidelines were randomized to either placebo (5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose, 0.15% methyl paraben, and 10% glycerol in distilled water qsp 100 g) or treatment (urea 10%) to be applied to the oral cavity 3-4 times per day for 3 months. The patients were evaluated before and after treatment with the following instruments: the EDOF-HC protocol (Orofacial Pain Clinic - Hospital das ClÃ­nicas), a xerostomia questionnaire, and quantitative sensory testing.There were no differences in salivary flow or gustative, olfactory, or sensory thresholds (P>0.05). Fifteen (60%) patients reported improvement with the treatments (P=0.336).In conclusion, there were no differences between groups, and both exhibited an association between reported improvement and salivation.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24604360","annotations":[{"name":"Xerostomia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerostomia"},{"name":"Glycerol","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol"},{"name":"Carboxymethyl cellulose","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxymethyl_cellulose"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.729219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.611571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.518321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.482162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.429433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.401749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Methylparaben","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylparaben"},{"name":"Olfaction","weight":0.316544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.160334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.141581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Bristol-Myers Squibb","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol-Myers_Squibb"},{"name":"Glossodynia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossodynia"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.104334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Sensory system","weight":0.059578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_system"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Distilled water","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_water"},{"name":"International Association for the Study of Pain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_the_Study_of_Pain"},{"name":"Paraben","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraben"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Sensory threshold","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_threshold"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"International Association for Professional Base Ball Players","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_Professional_Base_Ball_Players"},{"name":"Pain Clinic","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_Clinic"}]}
