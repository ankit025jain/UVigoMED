{"id":29703,"title":"[Rationale for differentiated sanitary protection zones for battery recycling enterprises in modern conditions].","abstract":"In the paper there is presented the rationale for differentiated sanitary protective zones in the present conditions both of the increase of volumes of production and introduction of various technological solutions on the example of battery recycling enterprise. It is established that the in acting regulations the classification of enterprises recycling of non-ferrous metals, fails to take into account such the hazard risks criteria of the enterprise, as volume of emissions of priority substances, the height of their arrival in the atmosphere, etc., and also does not take into account increased significantly in the current time processing volumes. The results of the performed research allowed to offer new positions in the classification of production of secondary lead from used batteries (I to IV class), depending on the volume of production (from 20 000 to 160 000 tons per year), the amount of emissions of lead (0.2 to 1, 6 tons per year) and release height (15 to 60 m).","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624832","annotations":[{"name":"Paper","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Atmosphere","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.638822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Recycling","weight":0.626043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.613652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.609439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.546869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.455173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.286427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Ferrous","weight":0.152612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrous"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Supporting actor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporting_actor"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Feminine hygiene","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminine_hygiene"},{"name":"Battery recycling","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_recycling"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
