{"id":3979,"title":"HERC2/USP20 coordinates CHK1 activation by modulating CLASPIN stability.","abstract":"CLASPIN is an essential mediator in the DNA replication checkpoint, responsible for ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein)-dependent activation of CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1). Here we found a dynamic signaling pathway that regulates CLASPIN turn over. Under unperturbed conditions, the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2 regulates the stability of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP20 by promoting ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation. Under replication stress, ATR-mediated phosphorylation of USP20 results in the disassociation of HERC2 from USP20. USP20 in turn deubiquitinates K48-linked-polyubiquitinated CLASPIN, stabilizing CLASPIN and ultimately promoting CHK1 phosphorylation and CHK1-directed checkpoint activation. Inhibition of USP20 expression promotes chromosome instability and xenograft tumor growth. Taken together, our findings demonstrated a novel function of HERC2/USP20 in coordinating CHK1 activation by modulating CLASPIN stability, which ultimately promotes genome stability and suppresses tumor growth.","date":"2014-11-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25326330","annotations":[{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia","weight":0.921372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.83179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Ubiquitin ligase","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase"},{"name":"Ubiquitin","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.740761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.719283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.700863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"CHEK1","weight":0.68901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHEK1"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Ligase","weight":0.673924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.617919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related","weight":0.571558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia_and_Rad3_related"},{"name":"Cell cycle checkpoint","weight":0.443164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_checkpoint"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Telangiectasia","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangiectasia"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0523561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Dissociation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
