{"id":60994,"title":"Bendamustine as salvage treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma patients: a retrospective study of the Spanish experience.","abstract":"Patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) have an adverse outcome after relapse. Bendamustine has demonstrated a good efficacy and toxicity profile in previously reported trials. In this study, we present a retrospective analysis of the Spanish experience in relapsed/refractory MCL treated with bendamustine in combination or alone with the objective of knowing the efficacy and toxicity profile of this treatment in our current clinical practice. Fifty eight patients were registered: 67 % male with median age of 71 years, and 2 is the median number of previous lines. The most frequent bendamustine regimen was bendamustine plus rituximab (83 %). The median number of cycles was 5 (range 1-8). The overall response rate was 84 % with 53 % of complete response/unconfirmed complete response (CR/uCR). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 16 months (95 % confidence interval (CI) 13.3-18.8), and for patients who achieved CR/uCR, it was 33 months (95 % CI 11.1-54.2). Median overall survival (OS) was 30 months (95 % CI 25.6-34.9). For PFS, only blastoid histology and not achieving CR after bendamustine had a significant negative impact on the univariate and multivariate analyses (p?<?0.05). Nevertheless, for OS, only an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) had negative impact on both, univariate and multivariate analyses (p?<?0.05). Only one case of treatment-related mortality in a 79-year-old patient with very bad performance status was reported. In 280 cycles, 12 (4 %) hospitalizations for febrile neutropenia were reported. In our population, bendamustine has been a good salvage treatment with a favorable toxicity profile in a non selected and heavily pretreated population of patients with MCL.
