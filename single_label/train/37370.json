{"id":37370,"title":"Successful endovascular treatment of bilateral intralobar pulmonary sequestration with a bridging isthmus in a child.","abstract":"Pulmonary sequestration refers to aberrant formation of segmental lung tissue that has no connection with the bronchial tree and receives a blood supply from a systemic artery. Bilateral pulmonary sequestration, especially with a bridging isthmus is extremely rare. Although endovascular treatment is regarded as the less invasive alternative for the treatment of pulmonary sequestration, all previously reported bilateral pulmonary sequestrations have been treated surgically. We report the case of a 13-year-old girl who underwent successful endovascular treatment for bilateral pulmonary sequestration with a bridging isthmus. Thoracic CT angiography showed a heterogeneous mass-like consolidation in the both lower lobes connected each other via a bridging isthmus behind the heart. CT also demonstrated an aberrant artery, which originated from the celiac trunk, supplied the sequestration of the left lower lobe, and that a branch from the aberrant artery traversed to the sequestration in the right lower lobe. After percutaneous endovascular embolization using microcoils and gelfoam, the patient had no complications and the bilateral sequestration showed markedly decrease in the size.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24500896","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.785708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.733473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Celiac artery","weight":0.680895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celiac_artery"},{"name":"Bronchus","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.486616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.409834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.372668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pulmonary sequestration","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_sequestration"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.252852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.24321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.149224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.148516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Computed tomography angiography","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography_angiography"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Branch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
