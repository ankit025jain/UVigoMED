{"id":69406,"title":"Dietary trends and management of hyperphosphatemia among patients with chronic kidney disease: an international survey of renal care professionals.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to review the opinions and experiences of renal care professionals to examine dietary trends among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and problems associated with the clinical management of hyperphosphatemia.This was an online survey comprising open and closed questions requesting information on patient dietary trends and the clinical management of hyperphosphatemia. The study was conducted in 4 European countries (the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom).Participants were 84 renal care professionals.This was an online survey.Responder-reported experiences and perceptions of patient dietary trends and hyperphosphatemia management were assessed.Most survey responders (56%) observed an increase in the consumption of processed convenience food, 48% noticed an increase in the consumption of foods rich in phosphorus-containing additives, and 60% believed that there has been a trend of increasing patient awareness of the phosphorus content of food. Patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) were most likely to experience difficulties in following advice on dietary phosphorus restriction (38% of responders estimated that 25-50% of their patients experienced difficulties, and 29% estimated that 51-75% experienced difficulties). Maintaining protein intake and restricting dietary phosphorus were perceived as being equally important by at least half of responders for predialysis patients (56%) and for those undergoing peritoneal dialysis and HD (54% and 50%, respectively). There were international variations in dietary trends and hyperphosphatemia management.Although most responders have observed a trend of increasing awareness of the phosphorus content of food among patients with CKD, the survey results indicate that many patients continue to experience difficulties when attempting to restrict dietary phosphorus. The survey responses reflect the global trend of increasing consumption of processed convenience foods and phosphorus-containing additives, which has implications for the management of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447438","annotations":[{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.814061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.77955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.757355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.716893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.671356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.671356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Phosphorus","weight":0.524854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.51033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Convenience food","weight":0.441559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_food"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Peritoneal dialysis","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_dialysis"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.262436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.196352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.164226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Hyperphosphatemia","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperphosphatemia"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
