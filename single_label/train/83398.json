{"id":83398,"title":"Clinical outcomes with a trifocal intraocular lens: a multicenter study.","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical results and safety obtained with a new type of multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) using a trifocal design to achieve pseudoaccommodation.A pilot observational study of patients with a trifocal IOL (FineVision; PhysIOL, Liege, Belgium) implanted by 1 of 12 surgeons between March and December 2010. Visual outcomes that were assessed postoperatively included uncorrected and corrected distance, intermediate, and near visual acuity.One hundred ninety-eight eyes of 99 patients were analyzed. Patients were observed for an average of 6.44 ± 4.67 months (range: 0.2 to 17 months). Preoperative corrected distance visual acuity was 0.22 ± 0.26 logMAR. At the final follow-up visit, corrected distance visual acuity was 0.01 ± 0.10 logMAR, uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.01 ± 0.06 logMAR, uncorrected intermediate visual acuity was 0.08 ± 0.10 logMAR, and mean uncorrected near visual acuity was 0.00 ± 0.04 logMAR. Postoperative binocular uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.01 ± 0.07 logMAR, uncorrected intermediate visual acuity was 0.06 ± 0.08 logMAR, and uncorrected near visual acuity was -0.03 ± 0.04 logMAR. Postopeative mean residual sphere was 0.21 ± 0.48 diopters (D), with a residual cylinder of -0.24 ± 0.31 D. Postoperative spherical equivalent was 0.11 ± 0.36 D.The results demonstrated that the trifocal FineVision IOL is able to restore near, intermediate, and distance visual function.","date":"2014-11-07","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375849","annotations":[{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.552547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.453839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.324431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Binocular vision","weight":0.302656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.263889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.217819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.143318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0735104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Trifocal lenses","weight":0.0288827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifocal_lenses"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Progressive lens","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_lens"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Liege, Belgium","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liege,_Belgium"},{"name":"Liege","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liege"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"}]}
