{"id":88742,"title":"Reconstruction of an extensive soft tissue and bone defect of the first metatarsal with the use of Masquelet technique: a case report.","abstract":"The literature regarding reconstruction of foot bone defects is limited. The purpose of this study is to present a case report with an extensive bone defect of the first metatarsal bone which was treated with the use of the induced membrane technique. A 53-year-old man, with comminuted foot grade IIIb open fracture was treated with the Masquelet procedure. At 14 months follow-up, clinical and radiological assessment of the foot revealed osseous healing and no signs of infection, osteolysis or hardware failure. At 18 months follow-up, the patient had no pain and returned to his usual daily activities. The Masquelet procedure provides an effective method of treatment of extensive bone defects of the foot. It can restore the normal length and metatarsal arch minimizing the risk of complications that occurs with other surgical procedures.Level V, case report.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796840","annotations":[{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.354078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.347903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.289614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"First metatarsal bone","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_metatarsal_bone"},{"name":"Hardware","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Normal lens","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_lens"}]}
