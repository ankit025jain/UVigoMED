{"id":55578,"title":"Medial lower lid epiblepharon repair solely by skin-redraping medial epicanthoplasty.","abstract":"To evaluate clinical efficacy of a procedure using solely skin-redraping medial epicanthoplasty without traditional epiblepharon correction methods in patients with medial lower lid epiblepharon with epicanthal fold.This clinical practice study included 24 eyes of 12 patients with medial lower lid epiblepharon who underwent epiblepharon repairs from January to September 2012. The patients included were those whose cilia touch disappeared with medial epicanthal fold traction for temporary medial epicanthal fold repair during preoperative examination. The patients underwent the sole procedure of skin-redraping medial epicanthoplasty.The mean age was 7.50 ± 3.23 years and the mean period of follow-up was 12.5 ± 3.80 months. Complete correction of cilia touch was observed in all patients. Surgical complications such as canalicular injury, skin fold, severe hypertrophic scar and excessive haemorrhage were not observed in any patients. Cosmetic results of surgical intervention were considered satisfactory by all patients, including one case of mild scar formation. There was no recurrence during the follow-up period.For patients with medial lower lid epiblepharon with epicanthal fold without excessive skin and muscle, a simple skin-redraping medial epicanthoplasty without traditional epiblepharon correction methods showed good results of epiblepharon repair.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24855116","annotations":[{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.606021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Cilium","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.430159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cosmetic surgery","weight":0.0752417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetic_surgery"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Skin fold","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_fold"},{"name":"Epicanthic fold","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicanthic_fold"},{"name":"Hypertrophic scar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_scar"},{"name":"Epicanthoplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicanthoplasty"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Traction (orthopedics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)"},{"name":"Myocardial scarring","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_scarring"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"}]}
