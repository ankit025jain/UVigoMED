{"id":68691,"title":"Case report: long-lasting response in a patient with metastatic renal cell cancer receiving antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes.","abstract":"Adoptive immunotherapy can be a therapeutic option to treat cancer patients with advanced-stage disease refractory to conventional therapies.We used T-cell therapy with autologous antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Autologous antitumor CTLs obtained by stimulating CD8-enriched cells with dendritic cells pulsed with irradiated apoptotic tumor cells and expanded in vitro were transfused on days +14 and +28 following chemotherapy and every 2 to 4 months thereafter.Treatment with high doses of antitumor CTLs proved to be safe and induced immunological responses and long-lasting clinical benefit in our patient.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503804","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.76159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.723624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.676801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.568006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"}]}
