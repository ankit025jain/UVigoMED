{"id":54375,"title":"A new preoperative prognostic scoring system to predict prognosis in patients with locally advanced pancreatic body cancer who undergo distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection: a retrospective cohort study.","abstract":"Distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) provides good local control for locally advanced pancreatic body cancer, but early recurrence still occurs. In this study, we aimed to establish a new scoring system to predict prognosis using preoperative factors in patients with locally advanced pancreatic body cancer who undergo DP-CAR.Prognostic factors were analyzed using various data collected retrospectively from 50 consecutive patients who underwent DP-CAR. Using these preoperative factors, a scoring system to predict prognosis was established.Multivariate analysis identified intraoperative blood loss (?940 mL; hazard ratio [HR], 25.179; P = .0003), preoperative platelet counts (<150 × 10(9)/L; HR, 7.433; P = .0043), preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (?0.4 mg/dL; HR, 7.064; P = .0018), and preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels (?300 U/mL; HR, 8.197; P = .0053) as independent adverse prognostic factors. For the 3 preoperative factors, preoperative platelet counts <150 × 10(9)/L, preoperative CRP levels ?0.4 mg/dL, and preoperative CA19-9 levels ?300 U/mL were allocated 1 point each. The total score was defined as the Preoperative Prognostic Score (PPS). The estimated disease-specific 1- and 5-year survival rates for the 26 patients with PPS0 were 95.7%, and 49.1%, respectively, and for the 15 patients with PPS1, they were 86.7% and not available, respectively. The median survival times for PPS0 and PPS1 were 50.6 and 22.3 months, respectively. In contrast, in the 9 patients with PPS2/3, 1- and 5-year survival rates were 33.3% and 0%, respectively, and median survival time was only 7.7 months.A new prognostic scoring system using the preoperative platelet count, CRP, and CA19-9 enables preoperative prediction of prognosis and facilitates selection of appropriate treatment for borderline resectable cases of locally advanced pancreatic body cancer.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Endocrine System
