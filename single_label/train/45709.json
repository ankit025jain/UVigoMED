{"id":45709,"title":"What is the purpose of liver function tests?","abstract":"The liver is the body's largest single discrete organ. It has four major functions: metabolism and synthesis; excretion; storage; and the detoxification of potential poisons. These diverse functions mean that a single test does not give enough information to assess fully how the liver is functioning; at least five different liver function tests are required. This article, part 2 in a four-part series, discusses the information on acute and chronic liver disease that these tests can provide, and how disease affects liver function.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669469","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.632101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.378737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Detoxification","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.137978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.131341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.114892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.10613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Chronic liver disease","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_liver_disease"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
