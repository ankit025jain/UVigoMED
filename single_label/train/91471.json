{"id":91471,"title":"[Surgical treatment of mandibular fractures in its portions of the body and angle].","abstract":"The data about surgical treatment efficacy for mandibular fractures in portions of the body and the angle, depending on the trauma character and the method of osteosynthesis applied, were adduced. The main criteria, according to which the surgical interventions efficacy was estimated, were: the reposition accuracy, stability of the fragments fixation invasiveness, and the operation duration, The results of treatment of biomechanically-favorable linear fractures, occurring perpendilular to the mandibular axis, are trustworthy better (P < 0.05) than such of biomechanically-unfavorable oblique, fragmental fractures with the bone defects. Effective treatment of a biomechanically-favorable fractures is possible to guarantee using installation of one miniplate on the site of external oblique line. In biomechanically-unfavorable fractures the necessity have appeared to increase the fixing plates quantity, their rigidity raising or the functional restrictions introduction postoperatively.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24501993","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.457191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.39014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0682477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Rotation around a fixed axis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Installation art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_art"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Oblique line of thyroid cartilage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_line_of_thyroid_cartilage"},{"name":"Rock fragment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_fragment"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Abdominal external oblique muscle","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_external_oblique_muscle"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
