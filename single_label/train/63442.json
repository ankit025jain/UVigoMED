{"id":63442,"title":"Cladribine, cytarabine, filgrastim, and mitoxantrone (CLAG-M) compared to standard induction in acute myeloid leukemia from myelodysplastic syndrome after azanucleoside failure.","abstract":"For patients with acute myeloid leukemia from antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome particularly after azanucleoside treatment failure, outcome is poor. Here, we conducted a case-control study in these patients to compare the efficacy of CLAG-M induction (28 patients) versus standard 3+7 induction chemotherapy (24 patients). Response rates (P=0.014) and median overall survival (P=0.025) were 64% and 202 days (95% CI 37-367 days) versus 29% and 86 days (95% CI 36-136) in the CLAG-M and 3+7 cohorts, respectively. Median overall survival was 202 (95% CI 37-367 days) versus 86 days (95% CI 36-136) (P=0.025), respectively. CLAG-M has encouraging activity in this patient group.
