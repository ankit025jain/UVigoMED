{"id":66523,"title":"TGF-?1 expression in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma.","abstract":"Distinguishing renal oncocytoma (RO) from the eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) under the light microscope is a common diagnostic problem. Our recent research has shown significant difference between the presence of tumor fibrous capsule in ChRCCs and ROs. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-?1) is a potent cytokine involved in regulating a number of cellular processes. Two main purposes of this research were to investigate whether the TGF-?1 staining could be related to the presence of tumor fibrous capsule and if it could be used in the differential diagnosis between ChRCC and RO. We investigated 34 cases: 16 ChRCCs (8 eosinophilic and 8 classic) and 18 ROs. All available slides of each tumor, routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) were first analyzed to note the presence of tumor fibrous capsule. One paraffin embedded tissue block matching the representative H&amp;E slide was selected for the immunohistochemical analysis. TGF-?1 expression was analyzed semiquantitatively in the tumor tissue, the tumor fibrous capsule, if present and the peritumoral renal parenchyma. Intensity of TGF-?1 expression was weaker in ChRCCs than the one observed in ROs (P&lt;0.05). The type of reaction in ChRCCs was predominantly membranous unlike in ROs, which exhibited a predominantly cytoplasmic reaction (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, none of the ROs showed membranous type of reaction for TGF-?1. In the group of ChRCCs, tumors with capsule had statistically significant higher quantity of TGF-?1 expression in tumor tissue and in peritumoral renal parenchyma compared to the tumors without capsule (P&lt;0.05). Our results showed different types of TGF-?1 expression in ChRCCs and ROs: ChRCCs had predominantly membranous type of reaction, and ROs predominantly cytoplasmic. Furthermore, ChRCCs with capsule had statistically significant higher quantity of TGF-?1 expression in tumor tissue and in peritumoral renal parenchyma compared to the tumors without capsule. Based on these findings we can speculate that it could be possible that TGF-?1 plays a role in the formation of fibrous capsule in ChRCCs.
