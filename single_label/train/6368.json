{"id":6368,"title":"Vitamin E-diffused highly cross-linked UHMWPE particles induce less osteolysis compared to highly cross-linked virgin UHMWPE particles in vivo.","abstract":"Recent in vitro findings suggest that UHMWPE wear particles containing vitamin E (VE) may have reduced biologic activity and decreased osteolytic potential. We hypothesized that particles from VE-stabilized, radiation cross-linked UHMWPE would cause less osteolysis in a murine calvarial bone model when compared to virgin gamma irradiated cross-linked UHMWPE. Groups received equal amount of particulate debris overlaying the calvarium for 10 days. Calvarial bone was examined using high resolution micro-CT and histomorphometric analyses. There was a statistically significant difference between virgin (12.2%±8%) and VE-UHMWPE (3%±1.4%) groups in regards to bone resorption (P=0.005) and inflammatory fibrous tissue overlaying the calvaria (0.48 vs. 0.20, P<0.0001). These results suggest that VE-UHMWPE particles have reduced osteolytic potential in vivo when compared to virgin UHMWPE.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998319","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.841261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.813201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.752698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.703461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.621318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.498923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.475277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.373195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0950163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene"},{"name":"Debris","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris"},{"name":"Elementary particle","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle"},{"name":"Angular resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
