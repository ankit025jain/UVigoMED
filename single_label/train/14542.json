{"id":14542,"title":"[Antitumor effects of fresh gecko hydrolysate on H22 transplanted tumor in mice].","abstract":"To compare the inhibitory effects of fresh gecko crude extract and its hydrolysate on H22 transplanted tumor in mice.The content of soluble nitrogen (SN-TCA index) was used to determine the degree of enzymolysis. The hydrolysate of gecko was obtained from fresh gecko crude extract by pepsin and papain hydrolyzing. H22 transplanted tumor mouse models were established and divided into negative group, positive group,crude extract group and hydrolysate group.The inhibition rate of the H22 tumor-bearing mice was 29.17%, 48.99% respectively for the crude extract group and the hydrolysate group. The inhibition rate of hydrolysate group and the negative group were significantly different (P < 0.05). The spleen and thymus index for the crude extract group and the hydrolysate group didn't show different compared with the negative group.The crude extract of the fresh gecko and the hydrolysate can inhibit the growth of the H22 transplanted tumor. The enzymolysis by pepsin and papain can increase the antitumor activity of the crude extract of fresh gecko.","date":"2014-01-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417135","annotations":[{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.778506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.729883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.603844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.431107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Papain","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papain"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.366972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Gecko","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Pepsin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsin"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"DiGeorge syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiGeorge_syndrome"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Honda H Engine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_H_Engine"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
