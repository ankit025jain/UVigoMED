{"id":74493,"title":"Association between insomnia symptoms and functional status in U.S. older adults.","abstract":"We studied the association between insomnia symptoms and late-life functioning, including physical capacity, limitations in household activities, and participation in valued activities.Participants were 6,050 adults independent in self-care activities from a representative sample of older Medicare beneficiaries. They completed objective measures of physical capacity and self-report measures of insomnia symptoms, help and difficulty with household activities, and participation in valued activities.After adjustment, insomnia symptoms were associated with a greater odds of receiving help or having difficulty with selected household activities (laundry, shopping), greater odds of help or difficulty with ? 1 household activity [1 symptom vs. 0, odds ratio (OR)=1.27, p < .05; 2 symptoms vs. 0, OR = 1.35, p < .01), and of restricted participation in specific valued activities (attending religious services, going out for enjoyment) and in ? 1 valued activity (1 symptom vs. 0, OR = 1.29, p < .05; 2 symptoms vs. 0, OR = 1.50, p < .01). There was no independent association between insomnia symptoms and physical capacity.Among older adults, insomnia symptoms are associated with a greater odds of limitation in household activities and of restricted participation in valued activities. Insomnia interventions may improve functioning and quality of life among elders.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25342821","annotations":[{"name":"Happiness","weight":0.438193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.435138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Religion","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.159271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Shopping","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping"},{"name":"Medicare (United States)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Jewish prayer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_prayer"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Laundry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Beneficiary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficiary"},{"name":"Independent (politician)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politician)"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
