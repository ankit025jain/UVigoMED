{"id":21240,"title":"Point prevalence surveys of healthcare-associated infections and use of indwelling devices and antimicrobials over three years in a tertiary care hospital in India.","abstract":"Few hospitals in India perform regular surveillance for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and use of indwelling devices and antimicrobials. The aim of this study was to conduct two one-day point prevalence surveys of HAIs and use of indwelling devices and antimicrobials in a large 1800-bed tertiary care hospital in India. The overall prevalence of HAIs was 7%, and surgical site infections were the most common (33%). Indwelling devices were present in 497 (27%) patients, and 915 (50%) patients were receiving antimicrobials. This study helped to generate robust baseline data on the prevalence of HAIs and use of indwelling devices and antimicrobials in the study hospital.
