{"id":51690,"title":"Effect of the administration of alpha-lipoic acid on contrast sensitivity in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of oral supplementation of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on contrast sensitivity (CS) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study included 12 patients with T1DM aged 43±12 years, 48 patients with T2DM aged 59±10 years, and 20 control subjects aged 33±8 years. Patients from each studied group, including the control group, were randomly assigned to receive 300?mg of ALA orally once daily for 3 months. CS was evaluated with the Functional Acuity Contrast Test (FACT, Stereo Optical). In the group of patients with T1DM receiving ALA for 3 months CS remained stable and improved in those with T2DM. Reduction of CS in both T1DM and T2DM patients without alpha-lipoic acid supplementation was observed. In the control group on alpha-lipoic acid supplementation, CS improvement was noticed at one spatial frequency. Changes in the CS were observed, despite stable visual acuity and eye fundus image in all studied subjects. Our study demonstrated that oral administration of alpha-lipoic acid had influence on CS in both T1DM and T2DM patients.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665163","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.723718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.62345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.533894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.450458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.375875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.309485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.309423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.263198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0693032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Spatial frequency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_frequency"},{"name":"Contrast sensitivity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_sensitivity"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Stereophonic sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 338","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_338"},{"name":"Contrast (vision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)"},{"name":"Alpha-Linolenic acid","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Linolenic_acid"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
