{"id":82091,"title":"Myopericytoma of the parotid region treated by extracapsular dissection.","abstract":"Myopericytoma (MPC) is a vascular neoplasm exhibiting differentiation towards perivascular cells. Variable cytoarchitechtural features are visible within MPC, and there is much overlap between MPC, myofibroma and glomus tumours. MPC have a local recurrence rate of 10-20% and malignancy has been described in a few published cases. Previously, superficial parotidectomy has been recommended for MPC but, in this case, the surgical approach was via extracapsular dissection (ECD). A 66-year-old Caucasian man presented with a palpable mass arising from the superficial lobe of the right parotid gland. Following removal by ECD, the histopathological diagnosis of MPC was made. This is the first published report describing ECD of MPC associated with the parotid gland. ECD is preferable to superficial parotidectomy for small superficial lesions such as MPC, with similar oncological outcomes and fewer functional and aesthetic complications.
