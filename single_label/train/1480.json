{"id":1480,"title":"Characteristics of sex partners and sexual partnership correlates of inconsistent condom use among male injection drug users in India.","abstract":"Previous studies have established the risky behaviors of IDUs in India, and that IDUs are sexually active; however, there is a need to better understand the nature of sexual partnerships of IDUs. A total of 783 (Delhi) and 766 (Imphal) male IDUs were recruited into the study through respondent-driven sampling. We examined characteristics of sex partners of male IDUs and individual and sexual partnership characteristics associated with unprotected sex in Delhi and Imphal. While 16.8% of sexual partnerships in Delhi were male-to-male, there were almost no male-to-male partnerships in Imphal. The majority of partners of male IDUs in Delhi (82.5%) and Imphal (92.3%) do not inject drugs, with the exception of male partners of male IDUs in Delhi. Commercial partners (females: 58.3%; males: 71.3%) were the most common type of sex partners of male IDUs in Delhi, while regular partners (65.2%) were the most common type of sex partners in Imphal. In Delhi, characteristics of sex partners significantly associated with unprotected sex were being male/transgender (AOR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.2-4.0), being a regular (AOR 5.1; 95% CI: 2.8-9.4) or non-regular partner (AOR 2.7; 95% CI: 1.7- 4.5), and sharing needles/syringes with the index IDU (AOR 2.8; 95% CI: 1.4-5.3). In Imphal, partner characteristics associated with unprotected sex were being a regular (AOR 10.1; 95% CI: 41-25.1) or non-regular partner (AOR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.5-7.6), and living outside of town or state (AOR 3.3; 95% CI: 1.2-9.6). Enhanced understanding of disassortative sexual mixing and context of unprotected sex within sexual partnerships may enhance sexual risk reduction interventions for IDUs.","date":"2014-11-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427360","annotations":[{"name":"Condom","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Safe sex","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_sex"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.641531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Sexual partner","weight":0.530164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_partner"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.479743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"India","weight":0.459575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.350483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Drug injection","weight":0.261876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_injection"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.234319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Delhi","weight":0.233534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi"},{"name":"Sexual reproduction","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Imphal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imphal"},{"name":"Album-oriented rock","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-oriented_rock"},{"name":"766","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/766"},{"name":"783","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/783"},{"name":"1 metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_metre"},{"name":"Town","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Domestic partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Risk management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Romance (love)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)"}]}
