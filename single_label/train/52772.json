{"id":52772,"title":"[Sources of error when using haemoglobin A1c].","abstract":"Measurement of glycated haemoglobin A1 in whole blood (b-HbA1c) can be used in both diagnosing and following up patients with diabetes. Correct interpretation of analytical results is contingent on agreement between average plasma glucose (p-glucose) and b-HbA1c. This article provides an overview of factors that may result in a discrepancy between average glucose concentration and b-HbA1c.Literature search in PubMed to identify scientific articles that describe strengths and weaknesses of b-HbA1c.The b-HbA1c reading usually provides a good picture of average p-glucose for the preceding two to three months. Patients who are being treated with iron/vitamin B12 supplements, have liver failure, haemolytic anaemia or bleeding usually have a lower b-HbA1c than their p-glucose level would suggest. With increasing patient age, B12 deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia, higher values of b-HbA1c are seen for the same p-glucose level. Some ethnic groups have a higher b-HbA1c than their average p-glucose would suggest, but the risk of long-term complications appears generally to be more closely associated with b-HbA1c than with the glucose level. Pregnancy, renal failure or haemoglobinopathies may make the b-HbA1c value unreliable as an expression of average p-glucose.Correct interpretation of b-HbA1c is conditional on the requisitioner being aware of possible sources of error. If the patient is suspected to have a condition that leads to lack of consistency between b-HbA1c and average p-glucose, glucose-based criteria must be used in diagnosing diabetes.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569741","annotations":[{"name":"Iron deficiency anemia","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_anemia"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Hemolytic anemia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolytic_anemia"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hemoglobinopathy","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobinopathy"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vitamin B12","weight":0.764484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Whole blood","weight":0.500347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_blood"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.467419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.459055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.213174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"}]}
