{"id":61160,"title":"Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the chest wall: a case report.","abstract":"Reports of primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of the chest wall are extremely rare in the literature. We report the case of a 62-year-old Chinese woman presenting with left-sided chest pain. A computed tomography scan showed a solid, round mass in the left anterior chest wall, involving the second and third costal cartilages. Complete resection and reconstruction of the chest wall was performed. The histological and immunohistochemical features of the mass were used to diagnose a primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
