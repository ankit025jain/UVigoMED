{"id":14162,"title":"Tamoxifen use for the management of mania: a review of current preclinical evidence.","abstract":"Preliminary data on the efficacy of tamoxifen in reducing manic symptoms of bipolar disorder (BD) suggest that this agent may be a potential treatment for the management of this psychiatric disorder. However, the antimanic properties of tamoxifen have not been fully elucidated, hampering the development and/or use of mood-stabilising drugs that may share its same therapeutic mechanisms of action. Notably, we may gain a greater understanding of the neurobiological and therapeutic properties of tamoxifen by using suitable animal models of mania.Here, we review the preclinical studies that have evaluated the effects of tamoxifen to provide an overview of the current progress in our understanding of its antimanic actions, highlighting the critical role of protein kinase C (PKC) as a therapeutic target for the treatment of BD.To date, this field has struggled to make significant progress, and the organisation of an explicit battery of tests is a valuable tool for assessing a number of prominent facets of BD, which may provide a greater understanding of the entire scope of this disease.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441937","annotations":[{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.865191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.864593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Mania","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.695711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.361926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Protein kinase C","weight":0.196208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Pornography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
