{"id":83880,"title":"Partial matricectomy with curettage and electrocautery: a comparison of two surgical methods in the treatment of ingrown toenails.","abstract":"An ingrown toenail is a common, painful, and debilitating condition.This study aims to compare 2 surgical methods (partial matricectomy with curettage and electrocautery) in the treatment of ingrown toenails.A total of 92 ingrown nails of the big toe in 86 patients underwent partial matricectomy with curettage, whereas 57 ingrown nails of the big toe in 52 patients underwent partial matricectomy with electrocautery.Recurrence was observed in 2 toenails in the partial matricectomy with curettage group, whereas no recurrence was observed in the partial matricectomy with electrocautery group (p > .05). The mean period of postoperative pain was 2.3 and 3.1 days in the curettage group and the electrocautery group, respectively (p < .05). There was a significant difference in the duration of scar tissue inflammation (p < .05).Both surgical methods are safe treatment modalities with a high success rate. Partial matricectomy, which is achieved using curettage, seems to be superior to electrocautery in respect of reduced inflammation and duration of pain.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229780","annotations":[{"name":"Cauterization","weight":0.81245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterization"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.61697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.265635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.219567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ingrown nail","weight":0.150313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrown_nail"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.148497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Hallux","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallux"},{"name":"Curettage","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curettage"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Toe (automotive)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe_(automotive)"}]}
