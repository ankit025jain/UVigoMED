{"id":55911,"title":"Modified supramid brow suspension in paediatric ptosis.","abstract":"To understand the safety and complication profile of the modified supramid brow suspension surgery in the paediatric ptosis.Retrospective interventional case series.Review of medical notes of 32 patients who underwent supramid brow suspension surgery of the upper lid. Surgery was performed by a single surgeon at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London during 2007-2012. Complication rates were analysed.Forty-six eyes of 32 patients underwent upper eye lid brow suspension surgery; 18 cases were unilateral and 14 bilateral. Mean follow-up period is 28 months after the surgery. Post-operative granulomatous reaction was noted in 6 eyes (13%) and prolonged exposure keratopathy in 2 eyes (4.3%). There were no cases of suture infection or exposure. No recurrence of ptosis was observed in any of the operated cases. Pupillary axis clearance was achieved in all eyes.Modified brow suspension surgery using supramid for upper eyelid ptosis is a safe and clinically useful procedure with low complication rate.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24786386","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"London","weight":0.67283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.610074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.444833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.346988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Great Ormond Street Hospital","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.153864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Ptosis (eyelid)","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptosis_(eyelid)"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.115793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Copyright","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Axis (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
