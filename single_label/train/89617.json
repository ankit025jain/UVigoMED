{"id":89617,"title":"Expression of human CD46 modulates inflammation associated with GalTKO lung xenograft injury.","abstract":"Evaluation of lungs from GalTKO.hCD46 pigs, genetically modified to lack the galactose-?(1,3)-galactose epitope (GalTKO) and to express human CD46, a complement regulatory protein, has not previously been described. Physiologic, hematologic and biochemical parameters during perfusion with heparinized fresh human blood were measured for 33 GalTKO.hCD46, GalTKO (n = 16), and WT pig lungs (n = 16), and 12 pig lungs perfused with autologous pig blood. Median GalTKO.hCD46 lung survival was 171 min compared to 120 for GalTKO (p = 0.27) and 10 for WT lungs (p < 0.001). Complement activation, platelet activation and histamine elaboration were significantly reduced during the first 2 h of perfusion in GalTKO.hCD46 lungs compared to GalTKO (?C3a at 120' 812 ± 230 vs. 1412 ± 1047, p = 0.02; ?CD62P at 120' 9.8 ± 7.2 vs. 25.4 ± 18.2, p < 0.01; ?histamine at 60' 97 ± 62 vs. 189 ± 194, p = 0.03). We conclude that, in addition to significant down-modulation of complement activation, hCD46 expression in GalTKO lungs diminished platelet and coagulation cascade activation, neutrophil sequestration and histamine release. Because GalTKO.hCD46 lung failure kinetics correlated directly with platelet and neutrophil sequestration, coagulation cascade activation and a rise in histamine levels within the first hour of perfusion, further progress will likely depend upon improved control of these pathways, by rationally targeted additional modifications to pigs and pharmacologic interventions.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698431","annotations":[{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.80241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Galactose","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.683877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Respiratory failure","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.579322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.519634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"CD46","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD46"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.425683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Endocytosis","weight":0.201841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.117022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Complement component 3","weight":0.015821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_component_3"},{"name":"Rationality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"},{"name":"Chemical kinetics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_kinetics"}]}
