{"id":71072,"title":"[UNICANCER patient expectations observatory: a new role for patients in health care institutions].","abstract":"UNICANCER, recognizing the role played by patients in their own management, set up a unique initiative in France in November 2011: the patient expectations observatory, which is designed to reorient and improve the quality of care provided by comprehensive cancer centers of the UNICANCER group based on a better knowledge and understanding of patient perceptions and preferences. An innovative internet-based participative consultation recorded and prioritized patient expectations. Patient management improvement actions in cancer centres were then generalized to equitably satisfy the identified patient expectations. By using patient expectations concerning organization of health care, cancer cancers therefore provide an example of the new modalities of patient participation in health care institutions, in line with the changes proposed by public authorities.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108959","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"France","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.373081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.330597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Observatory","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Patient participation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_participation"},{"name":"Identified patient","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identified_patient"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"NCI-designated Cancer Center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCI-designated_Cancer_Center"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Public-benefit corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-benefit_corporation"}]}
