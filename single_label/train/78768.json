{"id":78768,"title":"Cochlear implantation with round window insertion in children with otitis media with effusion.","abstract":"To discuss indications and surgical techniques for cochlear implantation (CI) in children with profound sensorineural hearing loss and otitis media with effusion (OME).Between January 2003 and May 2013, a total of 550 patients received cochlear implants at the Anhui Provincial Hospital, Hefei, China. Of these, 30 children with OME underwent CI with round window insertion in one stage.One-stage operations of CI with round window insertion were carried out in 30 children with OME. All electrodes were implanted successfully. CI was performed without complications and the electrode arrays were protected well. All implant devices worked normally and all patients performed well during an average follow-up period of 12 months. None of the patients experienced any immediate or delayed postoperative infection-related complications.CI with round window insertion could be safely and effectively performed in one stage in children with profound sensorineural hearing loss and OME. It is unnecessary to delay implantation to control OME, but it remains a challenging problem in operation.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577319","annotations":[{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.788465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.767603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"China","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.742039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.55342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.50131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.464153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.365507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.32168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anhui","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui"},{"name":"Hefei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefei"},{"name":"Embryonic diapause","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_diapause"},{"name":"Array data structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Provinces and territories of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Mexican Imperial Orders","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Imperial_Orders"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Round window","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_window"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Multielectrode array","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multielectrode_array"}]}
