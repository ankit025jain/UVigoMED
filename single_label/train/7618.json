{"id":7618,"title":"Withdrawal times of oxytetracycline and tylosin in eggs of laying hens after oral administration.","abstract":"Antimicrobials administered to laying hens may be distributed into egg white or yolk, indicating the importance of evaluating withdrawal times (WDTs) of the pharmaceutical formulations. In the present study, oxytetracycline and tylosin's WDTs were estimated. The concentration and depletion of these molecules in eggs were linked to their pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties. Twenty-seven Leghorn hens were used: 12 treated with oxytetracycline, 12 treated with tylosin, and 3 remained as an untreated control group. After completion of therapies, eggs were collected daily and drug concentrations in egg white and yolk were assessed. The yolk was used as the target tissue to evaluate the WDT; the results were 9 and 3 days for oxytetracycline and tylosin, respectively. In particular, oxytetracycline has a good oral bioavailability, a moderate apparent volume of distribution, a molecular weight of 460 g/mol, and is lightly liposoluble. Tylosin, a hydrosoluble compound, with a molecular weight of 916 g/mol, has a low oral bioavailability and a low apparent volume of distribution, too. Present results suggest that the WDTs of the studied antimicrobials are strongly influenced by their oral bioavailability, the distribution, and the molecular weight and solubility, and that these properties also influence the distribution between the egg yolk and white.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853528","annotations":[{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.804801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.714233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Egg white","weight":0.636716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_white"},{"name":"Egg yolk","weight":0.586829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_yolk"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Molecular weight","weight":0.544747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_weight"},{"name":"Volume of distribution","weight":0.531305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_distribution"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.524904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.332321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Physical chemistry","weight":0.307222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.305285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Withdrawal","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.154529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.128097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Distribution (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"White","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"}]}
