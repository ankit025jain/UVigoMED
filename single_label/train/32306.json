{"id":32306,"title":"Traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the middle meningeal artery with an arteriovenous fistula on a non-fractured site.","abstract":"We describe a rare case of a combined traumatic pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) on a non-fractured site. A 24-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with head trauma. He underwent a craniotomy and removal of an epidural hematoma on the right side. Twenty-five days later, he complained of pulsatile tinnitus on the left non-fractured side. Angiography revealed a markedly dilated proximal MMA with flow shunting to the pterygoid plexus. We performed proximal occlusion on the proximal MMA for the traumatic pseudoaneurysm and the AVF of the MMA using coils. Although immediate angiography showed retrograde contrast filling from the collateral vessels into the distal part of the pseudoaneurysm, follow-up angiography revealed that the lesion had successfully disappeared.
