{"id":88787,"title":"MR evaluation of breast implants.","abstract":"This article describes the rationale and indications for breast implant-related magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, alone or in combination with breast cancer-related MR imaging. Basic silicone chemistry, implant styles, and normal appearances of breast implants are described. The various presentations of breast implant rupture are described, and a 4-point staging scheme for intracapsular rupture is reviewed. Finally, a discussion of what the reviewing physician needs to know is presented, both before breast implant MR examinations are requested and afterward, when results are reported.
