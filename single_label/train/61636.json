{"id":61636,"title":"Potent reactive oxygen species-JNK-p38 activation by sodium salicylate potentiates death of primary effusion lymphoma cells.","abstract":"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare but aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma in immunodeficient patients. Resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens is common in PEL and contributes to a very poor prognosis; hence, novel potent anti-PEL agents are required. Anticancer effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well-established in epithelial cancer but are unclear in hematological malignancies. Therefore, the anticancer activities of selected NSAIDs, sodium salicylate (NaS), on PEL cell lines are of interest.Anti-proliferation of NaS on PEL cell lines was shown by MTT. Apoptosis induction and caspase activations were determined by flow cytometry analysis. ROS production was accessed by DCFH-DA. Western blot was performed to determine molecular mechanisms.NaS effectively inhibited cell proliferation of all PEL cell lines. Caspase-dependent apoptosis was demonstrated and simultaneous induction of reactive oxygen species production and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)-p38 activation was observed prior to apoptosis induction, and these might be responsible for NaS-induced apoptosis.Significant anticancer effects of NaS on PEL cell lines were found. A novel role of NaS for PEL treatment is suggested.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692721","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Sodium salicylate","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_salicylate"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.739164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.698286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Salicylic acid","weight":0.671019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.635415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.59835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.565631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.427246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.396681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.233977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0334287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
