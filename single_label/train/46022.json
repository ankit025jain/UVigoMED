{"id":46022,"title":"NOD2 gene mutations in ulcerative colitis: useless or misunderstood?","abstract":"NOD2 mutations have been linked to an increased risk of Crohn's disease and to some of its phenotypes. The association between NOD2 mutations and susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC) remains somewhat controversial and potential correlations between these mutations and UC phenotype have not been studied.To assess whether NOD2 mutations are a risk factor for UC in Portugal and if there are any genotype-phenotype correlations in these patients.The three main NOD2 mutations were searched in 200 patients with UC and in 202 healthy controls.NOD2 mutations were present in 28 patients with UC (14.0 %) and in 27 controls (13.4 %) (p?=?0.853). Mutation carriers were more likely to receive steroids during the first year of disease than non-carriers (54.2 % vs. 29.6 %, p?=?0.018) and among these patients the need for intravenous administration was more frequent in those with the R702W polymorphism (90.0 % vs. 45.5 %, p?=?0.014). In patients with severe colitis admitted for intravenous steroids, a greater proportion of mutation carriers was considered intravenous-steroid refractory and required salvage therapy (90.0 % vs. 38.1 %, p?=?0.004). Patients with NOD2 mutation were submitted to colectomy more frequently than non-carriers (17.9 % vs. 4.1 %. p?=?0.015). No correlation with the need for immunosuppressants/immunomodulators was found.In the Portuguese population, NOD2 mutations do not increase the risk of UC but are associated with a more aggressive course including greater need of steroids in the first year, increased incidence of intravenous-steroid refractoriness and a higher colectomy rate.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651958","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.831964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.734432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.673765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.534824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.515674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.34645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.330389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Salvage therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvage_therapy"},{"name":"NOD2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOD2"},{"name":"R702 road","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R702_road"},{"name":"University of California","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"853","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/853"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"702 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/702_(band)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Portuguese people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_people"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"NOD mice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOD_mice"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
