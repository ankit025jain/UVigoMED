{"id":51180,"title":"Diabetes in Torres Strait Islanders: challenges and opportunities for remote area nurses.","abstract":"Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait region have the highest prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in Australia; more than three times the rate of other Australians. Abdominal obesity and insulin resistance are the main causes for these high rates of the disorder. Further, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders diagnosed with diabetes have poorer glycaemic control and much lower rates of insulin use than non-Indigenous Australians diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes alongside extremely high rates of renal failure and other comorbidities. Interventions have been instigated in order to overcome these issues. Previously a simple recall system managed by local health workers achieved significant improvements in diabetes care, reduced diabetes-related hospitalisations by 40% and led to the implementation of a chronic disease register and recall system throughout the Torres Strait region. Nurses, Indigenous health workers and other health professionals play important roles in ensuring these interventions continue.
