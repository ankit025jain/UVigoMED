{"id":83932,"title":"Neighborhood ethnic composition, spatial assimilation, and change in body mass index over time among Hispanic and Chinese immigrants: Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.","abstract":"We investigated relations between changes in neighborhood ethnic composition and changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference among Chinese and Hispanic immigrants in the United States.We used Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis data over a median 9-year follow-up (2000-2002 to 2010-2012) among Chinese (n = 642) and Hispanic (n = 784) immigrants aged 45 to 84 years at baseline. We incorporated information about residential moves and used econometric fixed-effects models to control for confounding by time-invariant characteristics. We characterized neighborhood racial/ethnic composition with census tract-level percentage Asian for Chinese participants and percentage Hispanic for Hispanic participants (neighborhood coethnic concentration).In covariate-adjusted longitudinal fixed-effects models, results suggested associations between decreasing neighborhood coethnic concentration and increasing weight, although results were imprecise: within-person BMI increases associated with an interquartile range decrease in coethnic concentration were 0.15 kilograms per meters squared (95% confidence interval [CI]?= 0.00, 0.30) among Chinese and 0.17 kilograms per meters squared (95% CI =?-0.17, 0.51) among Hispanic participants. Results did not differ between those who did and did not move during follow-up.Residential neighborhoods may help shape chronic disease risk among immigrants.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211724","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.661495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.533278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"China","weight":0.434076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.361381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.356942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.232246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.196472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Residential area","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_area"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Overseas Chinese","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Chinese"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.0303278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Immigration to the United States","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States"},{"name":"Econometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics"},{"name":"Neighbourhood","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Cultural assimilation","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation"},{"name":"Municipal corporation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Square (algebra)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(algebra)"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0147534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
