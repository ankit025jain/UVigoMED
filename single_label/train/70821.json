{"id":70821,"title":"Inclusion of endogenous hormone levels in risk prediction models of postmenopausal breast cancer.","abstract":"Endogenous hormones are risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer, and their measurement may improve our ability to identify high-risk women. Therefore, we evaluated whether inclusion of plasma estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, prolactin, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) improved risk prediction for postmenopausal invasive breast cancer (n = 437 patient cases and n = 775 controls not using postmenopausal hormones) in the Nurses' Health Study.We evaluated improvement in the area under the curve (AUC) for 5-year risk of invasive breast cancer by adding each hormone to the Gail and Rosner-Colditz risk scores. We used stepwise regression to identify the subset of hormones most associated with risk and assessed AUC improvement; we used 10-fold cross validation to assess model overfitting.Each hormone was associated with breast cancer risk (odds ratio doubling, 0.82 [SHBG] to 1.37 [estrone sulfate]). Individual hormones improved the AUC by 1.3 to 5.2 units relative to the Gail score and 0.3 to 2.9 for the Rosner-Colditz score. Estrone sulfate, testosterone, and prolactin were selected by stepwise regression and increased the AUC by 5.9 units (P = .003) for the Gail score and 3.4 (P = .04) for the Rosner-Colditz score. In cross validation, the average AUC change across the validation data sets was 6.0 (P = .002) and 3.0 units (P = .03), respectively. Similar results were observed for estrogen receptor-positive disease (selected hormones: estrone sulfate, testosterone, prolactin, and SHBG; change in AUC, 8.8 [P < .001] for Gail score and 5.8 [P = .004] for Rosner-Colditz score).Our results support that endogenous hormones improve risk prediction for invasive breast cancer and could help identify women who may benefit from chemoprevention or more screening.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135988","annotations":[{"name":"Estrone","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrone"},{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Dehydroepiandrosterone","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone_sulfate"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Estrone sulfate","weight":0.611663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrone_sulfate"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.502772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.50247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Sex hormone-binding globulin","weight":0.265549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.246458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Chemoprophylaxis","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoprophylaxis"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Overfitting","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
