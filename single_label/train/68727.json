{"id":68727,"title":"The body mass index in relation with the self-perception of weight and the body composition from different populational groups.","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the self-perception of weight in relation with the body mass index and the body composition of three working groups composed of physically untrained young students, young athletes and patients diagnosed with chronic diseases. The working groups consisted of 110 participants: untrained students, athletes and dialysed patients; 50.9% women and 49.1% men; with an average age of 26.03. The BMI of the patients is significantly higher than the BMI of the athletes and untrained students. No significant differences were found between groups in terms of self-perception of weight. Compared to the physically untrained students and patients, the athletes have a significantly higher level of muscle tissue. The athletes also have a significantly lower adipose tissue than that of the physically untrained students and patients.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502079","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.535138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.222139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.112723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.0635535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Working group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_group"}]}
