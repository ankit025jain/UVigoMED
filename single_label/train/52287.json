{"id":52287,"title":"Influence of cognitive impairment on the management of ischaemic stroke.","abstract":"Because of ageing of the population, it is more and more frequent to treat ischaemic stroke patients with pre-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Currently, there is no specific recommendation on ischaemic stroke management in these patients, both at the acute stage and in secondary prevention. However, these patients are less likely to receive treatments proven effective in randomised controlled trials, even in the absence of contra-indication.To review the literature to assess efficacy and safety of validated therapies for acute ischaemic stroke and secondary prevention in PSCI patients.Most randomised trials did not take into account the pre-stroke cognitive status. The few observational studies conducted at the acute stage or in secondary prevention, did not provide any information that the benefit could be either lost or replaced by harm in the presence of PSCI.There is no reason not to treat ischaemic stroke patients with PSCI according to the currently available recommendations for acute management and secondary prevention. Further observational studies are needed and pre-stroke cognition should be taken into account in future stroke trials.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613474","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.726557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.476192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.40129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.374187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.312234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.217934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.210686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"}]}
