{"id":65491,"title":"Functional genetic variants in apoptosis-associated FAS and FASL genes and risk of bladder cancer in a Turkish population.","abstract":"The present study aimed to evaluate the role of functional polymorphisms of apoptosis-associated Fatty acid synthase (FAS) and fatty acid synthase ligand (FASL) genes in bladder cancer susceptibility as first presentation in a Turkish population.Genotypes of 91 patients with bladder cancer and 101 healthy controls were evaluated for the polymorphism of FAS-1377 G/A and FASL-844 T/C genes by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.The frequency of the FAS-1377 G allele was significantly higher in patients with bladder cancer compared to controls (p<0.001). A significantly increased risk for developing bladder cancer was found for the group bearing a T allele for FASL-844 compared to the homozygous FASL-844 CC genotype (p=0.027). FAS-1377 GG genotype and FASL-844 T allele were found to be independently associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Additionally, gene-gene interaction analysis revealed that the frequency of FAS-1377AA with FASL-844TC was significantly lower in patients with bladder cancer in comparison to those of controls (p<0.001). Extensive studies for gene-gene interaction are still needed.Our study provides new evidence that FAS-1377 G and FASL-844 T alleles may be used as low-penetrant risk factors for bladder cancer development in a Turkish population.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815844","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.847192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.752828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.739153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.414423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.318447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Restriction fragment","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0436208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Fatty acid synthase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_synthase"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"844","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/844"},{"name":"1377","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1377"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Turkish population","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_population"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"C.D.
