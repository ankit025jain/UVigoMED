{"id":56376,"title":"Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with congenital membranous punctal obstruction.","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with congenital membranous punctal obstruction.The medical records of patients who underwent surgical treatment for congenital membranous punctal obstruction between 1999 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The demographic data and clinical presentations of the patients were analyzed. Surgical intervention methods and treatment results were also evaluated.A total of 51 puncta in 31 eyes of 23 patients with congenital membranous punctal obstruction were included. Of the 31 eyes, 20 had both upper and lower punctal obstruction and 11 had single punctal obstruction. Up to 2008, 10 patients underwent simultaneous punctoplasty and silicone tube intubation; 7 were under 10 years of age and required general anesthesia for the procedure. All showed patent puncta without epiphora postoperatively. Of the 13 patients treated after 2008, 11 children underwent punctoplasty and lacrimal irrigation under general anesthesia. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) was found in 6 of the 11 patients, and combined silicone tube intubation was performed; 2 adults with both upper and lower punctal obstruction underwent only punctoplasty under local anesthesia. All puncta were opened sufficiently, but epiphora remained in 1 patient due to NLDO, requiring subsequent silicone intubation. Overall, NLDO was found in 7 of 13 patients.Congenital membranous punctal obstruction can be successfully treated by punctoplasty alone. Because this is often associated with NLDO, the nasolacrimal system should also be thoroughly evaluated.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698614","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.59208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.31387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.308728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Nasolacrimal duct","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolacrimal_duct"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.102124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Epiphora (medicine)","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphora_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.0194145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Lacrimal punctum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_punctum"},{"name":"Duct (HVAC)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(HVAC)"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
