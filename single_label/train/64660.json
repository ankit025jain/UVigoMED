{"id":64660,"title":"Cor a 14: missing link in the molecular diagnosis of hazelnut allergy?","abstract":"Hazelnut allergy shows distinct clinical patterns that can be predicted through component-resolved diagnosis. However, identification of sensitization profiles remains incomplete.Sera of 75 patients allergic to hazelnuts, 14 infants with atopic dermatitis (AD) sensitized to hazelnuts, 15 hazelnut-tolerant individuals with specific IgE (sIgE) to hazelnuts and 15 healthy control individuals were tested for sIgE reactivity to rCor a 1.04, rCor a 8, nCor a 9, nCor a 11, rCor a 14, rBet v 1, rBet v 2 and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs).Sensitization to Cor a 14 was observed in 18 out of 20 preschool children, 8 out of 10 school-aged children and 2 out of 7 adults with generalized reactions and in 3 out of 14 infants with AD. Only 2 out of 38 patients with an oral allergy syndrome (OAS) were sensitized to Cor a 14. No sensitization to Cor a 14 was observed in the group of hazelnut-tolerant and healthy control individuals. Sensitization to Cor a 1.04 was seen in 36 out of 38 OAS patients and in 14 out of 37 patients with generalized reactions. However, only 3 patients with generalized reactions were monosensitized to Cor a 1.04. Sensitization to Cor a 9 was observed in 26 out of 37 patients with generalized reactions and in 4 out of 14 infants with AD. Sensitization to Cor a 11, Cor a 8, rBet v 2 and CCDs was rare.Sensitization to Cor a 14 can have early onset and shows age-related variations. Together with Cor a 9, Cor a 14 enables us to correctly identify almost 90% of children with generalized reactions to hazelnut.","date":"2014-09-23","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034302","annotations":[{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.783482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.594264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Oral allergy syndrome","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_allergy_syndrome"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.153863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Hazelnut","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazelnut"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Charge-coupled device","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device"},{"name":"Organization of American States","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Transitional fossil","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_fossil"},{"name":"Sensitization","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization"}]}
