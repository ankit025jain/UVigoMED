Data of death for persons who died in the city of Arkhangelsk in the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 (one year) were copied out. The vast majority of alcohol conditioned deaths among men occurs in middle (working) age, 1/3 of women--over the age of 60 years. The alcohol-attributable mortality revealed the transformation of the structure of women over the age of 60 years compared with the mature age. Gender and age significantly affect the probability of death from alcohol only attribute states after 60 years. The results of the study indicate a different impact on the character of the individual sociodemographic factors on the probability of death from alcohol-attributable states in elderly and senile age.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051776","annotations":[{"name":"Old age","weight":0.604527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.548814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.51624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.291173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.286311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Death certificate","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_certificate"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Arkhangelsk","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkhangelsk"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Professional certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_certification"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"}]}
