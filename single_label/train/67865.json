{"id":67865,"title":"Positive correlation of serum parathormone and prostate specific antigen levels in prostate cancer.","abstract":"Clinical and experimental observations reveal the exact role of vitamin D in prostate cancer. Yet, a complete understanding of the issue necessitates the evaluation of the exquisite mechanisms that involve full actors of the calcium homeostasis in relation.Besides the role of vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) is now understood to be a mitogen for prostate cancer cells, and calcium has already been known for such role. The interplay between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system effector hormones and calcium homeostasis attracts attention in recent studies.Twenty five patients with prostate cancer (median age 66 (62-67) years) who had presented at the Urology Outpatient Clinic were prospectively included in the study. Also, 30 volunteer controls (median age 63 (60-70) years) were enrolled for comparison. Serum total PSA, intact PTH, calcium, aldosterone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were detected in a selected group of patients with prostate cancer.The vitamin D levels were lower in PCa patients in line with some of the previous studies, supporting the role of vitamin D in prostate cancer. We also observed a positive correlation between PTH and PSA both in PCa patients and the controls.Our findings indicate that like age and race, PSA is associated with PTH. The role of PTH, as a master of calcium homeostasis, seems to be neglected in prostate carcinogenesis, concerning a very few number of studies pertaining to the subject in the literature (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 19).","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579688","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.875198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.875192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Aldosterone","weight":0.818574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.669984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.487161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Calcium metabolism","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_metabolism"},{"name":"Mitogen","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"}]}
