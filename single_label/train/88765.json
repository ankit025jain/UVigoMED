{"id":88765,"title":"[Cognitive impairment in earthquake brain injury treated with comprehensive program of acupuncture and rehabilitation: a randomized controlled trial].","abstract":"To explore the comprehensive program of integrated Chinese and western medicine in the treatment of cognitive impairment in earthquake brain injury.The multi-central randomized controlled trial was adopted. The qualified subjects were randomized into an acupuncture + rehabilitation group (38 cases) and a rehabilitation group (35 cases). In the acupuncture + rehabilitation group, acupuncture, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and cognitive rehabilitation training were combined as the comprehensive program of integrated Chinese and western medicine in the treatment. In the rehabilitation group, HBO and cognitive rehabilitation training were adopted. The efficacy and safety were assessed.(1) After treatment of 2 months, the intelligent state, cognitive function and activity of daily life of patients were improved in the both groups (all P < 0.01). (2) After treatment of 2 months, the score of MMSE and the score of activity of daily life were (24.11 +/- 4.08) and (75.45 +/- 13.95) in the acupuncture + rehabilitation group, which were more significant as compared with (17.05 +/- 43.84), (66.06 +/- 12.75) in the rehabilitation group, respectively (both P < 0.01). In 6-month follow-up visit after treatment, the cognitive function and activity of daily life were improved continuously in the acupuncture + rehabilitation group, which was more significant as compared with the rehabilitation group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05).The integrated Chinese and western medicine of acupuncture, HBO and cognitive rehabilitation training is safe and effective in the treatment of cognitive impairment in earthquake brain injury. The therapeutic effect is more advantageous as compared with the simple rehabilitation program of western medicine.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796041","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Hyperbaric medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.615498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.575271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"HBO","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.345077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.312827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"China","weight":0.303946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.303016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
