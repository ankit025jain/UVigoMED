{"id":73875,"title":"Combinatorial approach to treatment of melanoma.","abstract":"There are multiple effective and well-tolerated systemic therapy treatments for the treatment of advanced melanoma, as well as new immunotherapy and targeted therapy agents in clinical trials. Traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted BRAF inhibitors can increase antigen presentation and can rebalance the intratumoral immune milieu. The combination of pulsed cytotoxic therapy and immunotherapy is a logical next step in designing treatment regimens. Combination radiotherapy and immunotherapy also has experimental and clinical support. The standard of care for patients with advanced melanoma remains participation in clinical trials in order to enhance understanding of the effectiveness and toxicities of combination regimens.
