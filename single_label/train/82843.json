{"id":82843,"title":"Simulation of lipofilling reconstructive surgery using coupled Eulerian fluid and deformable solid models.","abstract":"We present a method to simulate the outcome of reconstructive facial surgery based on fat-filling. Facial anatomy is complex: the fat is constrained between layers of tissues which behave as walls along the face; in addition, connective tissues that are present between these different layers also influence the fat-filling procedure. To simulate the end result, we propose a method which couples a 2.5D Eulerian fluid model for the fat and a finite element model for the soft tissues. The two models are coupled using the computation of the mechanical compliance matrix. Two contributions are presented in this paper: a solver for fluids which couples properties of solid tissues and fluid pressure, and an application of this solver to fat-filling surgery procedure simulation.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505774","annotations":[{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.77464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Finite element method","weight":0.665257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.636741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.580041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.459516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.43028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.343345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.3165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.302386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.249303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.0508123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Continuum mechanics","weight":0.0204144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics"},{"name":"Computation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Solver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solver"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Finite set","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
