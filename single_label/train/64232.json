{"id":64232,"title":"[Intestinal microorganisms and allergic diseases].","abstract":"According to the 'hygiene hypothesis', the intestinal microbes would not only regulate local immune status, but also affect systematic immune homeostasis, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. This review will mainly focus on investigating the intricate relationships among intestinal microbes, immune system and allergic diseases. Multiple factors affecting gut microorganisms may influence the immune homeostasis directly and later become risk factors of allergic diseases. This point of view may pave the way for the design of new interventions to the diseases.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25185300","annotations":[{"name":"Hygiene hypothesis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.783461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.470125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.302906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Narrative mode","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_mode"}]}
