{"id":55531,"title":"Charles Bonnet syndrome: characteristics of its visual hallucinations and differential diagnosis.","abstract":"To present an eight-case serie of patients with Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS).All patients were initially evaluated by an ophthalmologist and then submitted to a neurologic evaluation with exclusion of alternative psychiatric and neurologic diagnoses.Five patients were male (62.5%) and the mean age was 52.3+16.0 years. Two patients suffered from severe myopia and glaucoma, three had retinitis pigmentosa, one had anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, one had age-related macular degeneration and one had toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Mean visual acuity in the right eye was 1,12 logMAR and in the left eye 0.57 logMAR. A mean delay of 41.7 months occurred until diagnosis. All hallucinations were complexes and mostly ocurred on a weekly-basis (62.5%) and lasted for seconds (87.5%).Physicians who care for low vision patients should be aware of CBS and appropriately diagnose its hallucinations after exclusion of psychiatric and neurologic diseases.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863507","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.859903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.801885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Retinitis pigmentosa","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis_pigmentosa"},{"name":"Hallucination","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.78463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Low vision","weight":0.677919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_vision"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.674188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.618743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.534078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"CBS","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.299465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Charles Bonnet syndrome","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bonnet_syndrome"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Optic neuropathy","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Charles Bonnet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bonnet"},{"name":"Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_ischemic_optic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ischemic optic neuropathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_optic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Retinitis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinitis"}]}
