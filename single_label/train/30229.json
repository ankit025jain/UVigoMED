{"id":30229,"title":"Priority pharmacogenetics for the African continent: focus on CYP450.","abstract":"Countries in Africa have a high burden of communicable disease, and are experiencing an increase in noncommunicable diseases due to the effects of globalization, industrialization and urbanization. The costs incurred through adverse drug reactions and nonresponsiveness to therapy further aggravates the situation, and the application of pharmacogenetic principles is likely to provide some relief. Having undertaken an extensive evaluation of CYP450 reports in Africa, our objective was to map out areas of need based on regional disease burdens. The data confirms a paucity of CYP450 reports and illustrates large regions for which no population information exists. There is a dire need to address the health problems of Africa, and wide-scale pharmacogenetic profiling of these populations will add significantly to improving patient care on the continent. Priority pharmacogenetics for the African continent gives precedence to the profiling of clinically relevant pharmacogenetic biomarkers, and defines the immediate need in the context of disease burden.
