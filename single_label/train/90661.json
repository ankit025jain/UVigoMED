{"id":90661,"title":"Nuclear interaction between ADR-induced p65 and p53 mediates cardiac injury in iNOS (-/-) mice.","abstract":"Adriamycin (ADR) treatment causes an imbalance in the levels of nitric oxide ((•)NO) and superoxide (O2(•-)) production leading to cardiac injury. Previously we demonstrated that mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) have increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury. The molecular events leading to increased mitochondrial injury in iNOS deficient mice is unknown. ADR in the absence of iNOS preferentially activates a proapoptotic pathway without a concurrent increase in prosurvival pathways. Treatment with ADR leads to an increase in DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF?B) and p53 in wildtype mice. Following ADR treatment, p53, but not NF?B DNA binding activity, as well as the level of Bax, a p53 target gene, was increased in iNOS (-/-) mice. This apoptotic signaling effect in iNOS (-/-) is alleviated by overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Increases in NF?B and p53 in ADR-treated wildtype mice did not lead to increases in target genes such as MnSOD, bcl-xL, or Bax. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that p65, a prominent member of the NF?B family, interacts with p53 in the nucleus. These results suggest that NF?B and p53 may counter act one another's actions in ADR-treated wildtype (WT) mice. Further, these results identify a novel mechanism by which oxidative stress may regulate transcription of proapoptotic genes.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586632","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.927138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.810987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.805784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Manganese","weight":0.787966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.724485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.683173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.582647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.530091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.504047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.480798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"SOD2","weight":0.390557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOD2"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.124455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Transcriptional regulation","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_regulation"},{"name":"DNA-binding domain","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA-binding_domain"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunoprecipitation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
