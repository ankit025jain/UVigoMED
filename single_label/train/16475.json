{"id":16475,"title":"Prescription patterns and treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients treated within and outside the National Tuberculosis Programme in Pham Ngoc Thach hospital, Viet Nam.","abstract":"To describe and analyse the prescription patterns and treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients managed within Green Light Committee (GLC) and outside (non-GLC) the National TB programme in Viet Nam.Retrospective cohort study with two elements: (i) in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with clinical doctors, hospital pharmacists, and the non-GLC patients with MDR-TB; (ii) review of treatment cards and patients' charts of all GLC and non-GLC patients with MDR-TB put on treatment during 2010.Of 282 patients with MDR-TB, comprising 79 (28%) GLC patients MDR-TB and 203 (72%) non-GLC patients with MDR-TB, were enrolled in the study. Treatment delay was significantly higher in the GLC group (12.8 days) than the non-GLC group (2.3 days), (P = 0.004). The success rate was significantly better in GLC patients (84.8%) than in non-GLC patients (53.7%) (P < 0.001). The default rate was significantly higher in non-GLC patients than in GLC patients (25.6% vs. 6.3%), (P < 0.001). The risk of unsuccessful outcome was higher in non-GLC patients (Hazard ratio = 4.6, 95% CI: 1.8-11.8).The treatment outcomes of patients with MDR-TB in the GLC group were significantly better than in the non-GLC group. Reasons for the high default rate in non-GLC patients with MDR-TB must be further investigated.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995611","annotations":[{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.72339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.62554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.279122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.264226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Vietnam","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam"},{"name":"Pharmacist","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0471213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Group 12 element","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_12_element"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Playing card","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"811","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/811"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Default (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)"},{"name":"Natural disaster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Vietnamese people","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people"},{"name":"Greater London Council","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London_Council"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"}]}
