{"id":20763,"title":"Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among family members of infected and non-infected symptomatic children.","abstract":"This study determined the prevalence of seropositivity of anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies, and evaluated some socio-epidemiologic characteristics among family members of infected and non-infected symptomatic children. One hundred children with upper gastrointestinal symptoms without previous H. pylori eradication treatment were prospectively studied by both upper endoscopy with histopathological biopsies examination, and serum anti-H. pylori IgG test between July 2012 to June 2013. The patients were subdivided into: H. pylori infected children (GI), and H. pylori non-infected children (GII). Also, 320 of their family members were examined for serum anti-H. pylori IgG and stool antigen tests. Sheets were filled out included personal and medical history. The results showed statistically significant difference between both groups as regard dyspepsia, anemia, and histopathological findings (chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcer, and duodenitis). Family members were subdivided into: those of H. pylori infected symptomatic children (165) and those of H. pylori non-infected symptomatic children (155). Anti-H. pylori IgG prevalence was significantly higher in relatives of GI than those of GII (69.1% vs. 29%; p<0.05). The seroprevalence of H.pylori infection in all family members was (49.7%). Mothers of GI showed the highest seroprevalence (39.5%) as compared to fathers and siblings (22.8%, & 37.7%, respectively). Relatives of GI with low socioeconomic status, and lived in rural area showed the highest seroprevalence (82.5%, & 78.1% respectively).","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640875","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Dyspepsia","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspepsia"},{"name":"Gastritis","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.744909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Duodenitis","weight":0.668657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenitis"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.546141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.34992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.28264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
