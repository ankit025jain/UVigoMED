{"id":52093,"title":"Decreased sucrose preference in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","abstract":"Increased sugar consumption may adversely affect glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Although patients with diabetes are generally thought to prefer sweet tastes, few data are available on the sucrose preference in these individuals. The aim of the present study was to evaluate sucrose preference in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison with subjects without diabetes.Sucrose preference was assessed in 200 subjects (100 type 2 diabetes patients and 100 age-, sex- and body mass index (BMI)-matched control subjects). Sucrose preference was evaluated together with sucrose perception (i.e., sucrose sensitivity). Clinical and biochemical factors affecting sucrose taste were also analyzed.Participants with type 2 diabetes preferred lower sucrose concentrations compared with control subjects (p=0.001), although they had a less sensitive palate for sucrose compared with subjects without diabetes (p=0.012). Individual sucrose preference demonstrated a negative relationship with sensitivity to sucrose in control subjects. Notably, this relationship between sucrose preference and sensitivity was completely absent in participants with type 2 diabetes. Male patients with diabetes demonstrated a higher sucrose preference compared with female patients. There were no significant correlations between sucrose preference and glycemic control, duration of diabetes, or anti-diabetic medications.Participants with type 2 diabetes demonstrate a lower preference for sweet tastes than control subjects despite their decreased perception of sucrose. Reduced sucrose preference is not associated with better glycemic control in individuals with diabetes.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629412","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.601037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.513748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.410944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Sucrose","weight":0.252918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.244756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.105164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.0645239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Sweetness","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Physical attractiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness"}]}
