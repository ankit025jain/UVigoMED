{"id":50201,"title":"MiR-718 represses VEGF and inhibits ovarian cancer cell progression.","abstract":"Oncogenic activation of VEGF is found in various malignancies, including ovarian cancer. In this study, we investigate the role of microRNA (miRNA) in the regulation of VEGF in ovarian cancer. We find that miR-718 is expressed at low levels and inversely correlates with VEGF expression in ovarian cancer specimens. MiR-718 also directly targets and represses VEGF expression. In addition, miR-718 restoration inhibits ovarian cancer proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, VEGF expression could reverse the effect of miR-718 on ovarian cancer by increasing the levels of phosphorylated AKT. These results suggest a new therapeutic strategy in ovarian cancer by restoring miR-718 expression, which is involved in VEGF regulation.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815691","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.830328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.76432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.709591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.613322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"}]}
