{"id":46083,"title":"Hepatitis B virus nucleic acid amplification testing of Australian blood donors highlights the complexity of confirming occult hepatitis B virus infection.","abstract":"We present an analysis of the first 2?years of hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleic acid testing (NAT) of the Australian donor population.Between July 5, 2010, and July 4, 2012, all blood donations were screened for HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Donors who tested HBsAg negative but HBV NAT positive were assessed as occult hepatitis B infections (OBI) if reactive for antibodies to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc). Donors who were anti-HBc reactive but with nonrepeatable or nondiscriminated NAT results were assessed as HBV inconclusive pending follow-up testing.During the study period a total of 2,673,521 donations were screened for HBV. Forty-two chronic OBI infections (5.55/100,000 donors) were identified compared to eight acute serologic window period infections (1.06/100,000 donors). Of the 42 OBI cases, 23 (54.8%) were detected the first time they were screened for HBV DNA while 19 (45.2%) gave one or more HBV NAT-nonreactive results before detection. Of 68 donors initially assessed as HBV inconclusive and available for follow-up, 10 later confirmed as OBI cases while 51 were NAT nonreactive but remained anti-HBc reactive and OBI could not be excluded.This study demonstrated a substantially higher prevalence of OBI compared to acute serologic window period HBV infections in Australian blood donors. Follow-up testing of OBI cases indicates that HBV DNA is often only intermittently detectable in OBI, highlighting the importance of including anti-HBc to optimize the HBV testing algorithm.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650170","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Nucleic acid","weight":0.831559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.800817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.697229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Window period","weight":0.695251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_period"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.438413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Nucleic acid test","weight":0.431881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_test"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.280064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"July 4","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_4"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
