{"id":52484,"title":"Focal thoracic uptake mimicking lung metastasis on 131I post-therapy whole-body scan in patients with thyroid carcinoma.","abstract":"Whole-body 131I scan after total thyroidectomy is important in the evaluation of radioiodine avid metastatic foci in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. False-positive uptakes are occasionally seen in the thoracic region which should be evaluated carefully and not mistaken as lung metastases. We report here 2 cases of abnormal focal thoracic uptake, 1 case of a pleuropericardial cyst and 1 case of focal bronchiectasis, that could potentially be confused with lung metastasis. Careful correlation with diagnostic CT and subsequent follow-up studies suggested that these were not metastatic lesions.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598344","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Bronchiectasis","weight":0.791577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiectasis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Iodine-131","weight":0.703919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.667881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.528221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.411873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.370755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.256946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Focus (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"}]}
