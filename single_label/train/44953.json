{"id":44953,"title":"Gastric distension with SLIPA versus LMA ProSeal during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomized trial.","abstract":"We compared the quantitative clinical performances of the streamlined liner of the pharynx airway (SLIPA) and the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (LMA ProSeal) regarding intensity of gastric distension in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.A total of 124 anesthetized, paralyzed patients (ASA 1 to 2; aged, 18 to 80 y) were randomly allocated for airway management with the SLIPA or LMA ProSeal. After induction of general anesthesia using total intravenous anesthesia and rocuronium, the intensity of gastric distension was accessed twice by 2 raters, respectively. We also compared the fiberoptic bronchoscopic view of the glottis, the severity of blood stain, and postoperative sore throat.There were no statistically significant differences between groups for each gastric size. The change of gastric size within the SLIPA group was not statistically significant for both raters. Change within the LMA ProSeal group was significant in rater 2 (P=0.045) and marginally significant for rater 1 (P=0.056). Anatomic fit, complications during emergence, and the severity of blood stain and postoperative sore throat were similar in both groups.SLIPA is as efficacious as LMA ProSeal for use in patients without severe complications who are undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710248","annotations":[{"name":"Laryngeal mask airway","weight":0.932498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_mask_airway"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.701017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Airway management","weight":0.678945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_management"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Rocuronium bromide","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocuronium_bromide"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.475548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.22446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Sore throat","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Throat","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0303278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"}]}
