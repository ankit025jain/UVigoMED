{"id":46118,"title":"MCM7 serves as a prognostic marker in diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma and siRNA-mediated knockdown suppresses its oncogenic function.","abstract":"MCM7 (mini-chromosome maintenance protein 7) is essential for the initiation of genomic replication as a component of the pre-replication complex. The present study aimed to analyze its expression, clinical significance and biological functions in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). The MCM7 protein was upregulated in all 9 GAC cell lines. In 6 paired primary GACs, MCM7 was upregulated in tumor compared with the corresponding non-tumorous gastric tissues. In normal gastric epithelium tissue, MCM7 was strictly expressed in the proliferative compartment. MCM7 knockdown by siRNA in gastric cancer cell line AGS and NCI-N87 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, inhibited monolayer colony formation, reduced cell invasion and induced late apoptosis. Its nuclear expression correlated with advanced age and poorer disease specific survival in diffuse-type GACs. All the findings supported that MCM7 might play an oncogenic role in gastric tumorigenesis. It serves as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in diffuse-type GACs.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647462","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.834958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.791263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.700638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.688959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.661401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.661076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.647216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.630405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.60383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"MCM7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCM7"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Compartment (development)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_(development)"},{"name":"Monolayer","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolayer"}]}
