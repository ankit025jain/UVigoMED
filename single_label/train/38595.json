{"id":38595,"title":"Retrograde transvenous obliteration for uterine arteriovenous malformation.","abstract":"Transarterial embolization is an established treatment for uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM); however, in some cases, transarterial embolization is difficult. We present balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration as an alternative endovascular treatment for uterine AVM.A 24-year-old woman was diagnosed with uterine AVM. Her medical treatments were ineffective, and selective embolization was abandoned because of the extremely tortuous feeders. We used balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration, in which balloon catheters were inserted into the draining vein to stop the outflow. Then, a sclerosant was retrogradely injected through the catheter into the nidus. The abnormal vessels were fully obliterated, and there was no recurrence after the treatment.Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration may be an alternative treatment for uterine AVMs with adequate vascular structures.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413238","annotations":[{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.928562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.793241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.681782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.649749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.627397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.559801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.532642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Outflow (meteorology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outflow_(meteorology)"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 24","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_24"}]}
