{"id":31053,"title":"Hepatoprotective effects of Yulangsan polysaccharide against isoniazid and rifampicin-induced liver injury in mice.","abstract":"Yulangsan polysaccharide (YLSPS) is often used in popular folk medicine in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China as a chief ingredient of Millettia pulchra, which is used as an hepatic protection, anti-aging and memory improving agent. In this study, the hepatoprotective effects of YLSPS against isoniazid (INH) or rifampicin and isoniazid (RFP+INH)-induced liver injury were investigated in mice.The liver injury was induced by intragastric administration of INH or RFP+INH daily for 10 days. During the experiment, the model group received INH or RFP+INH only, and the normal control group received an equal volume of saline. Treatment groups received not only INH or RFP+INH but also the corresponding drugs, DDB (200mg/kg/day) or YLSPS (100, 200, and 400mg/kg/day) 2h after the administration of INH or RFP+INH.Analysis experiments showed that YLSPS significantly alleviated liver injury as indicated by the decreased levels of ALT and AST and the increased levels of SOD, GSH and GSH-Px. Moreover, YLSPS could effectively reduce the pathological tissue damage. The research on the mechanisms underlying the hepatoprotective effect showed that YLSPS was able to reduce lipid peroxidation and activate the anti-oxidative defense system.Our results show that YLSPS is effective in attenuating hepatic injury in the INH or RFP+INH-induced mouse model, and could be developed as a new drug for treatment of liver injury.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412379","annotations":[{"name":"Rifampicin","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin"},{"name":"Isoniazid","weight":0.911714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid"},{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.911436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"China","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Folk medicine","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_medicine"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.662088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.49426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.48647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Hepatoprotection","weight":0.461754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoprotection"},{"name":"Life extension","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.41596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.340536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.206332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"Guangxi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi"},{"name":"Flour treatment agent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour_treatment_agent"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Folk music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"}]}
