{"id":35562,"title":"Compensatory movements during functional activities in ambulatory children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.","abstract":"During the transitional phase (ambulatory to non-ambulatory), synergies characterize the evolution of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This study was performed to describe and quantify compensatory movements while sitting down on/rising from the floor and climbing up/down steps.Eighty videos (5 children × 4 assessments × 4 tasks) were recorded quarterly in the year prior to gait loss. Compensatory movements from the videos were registered based on the Functional Evaluation Scale for DMD.The most frequently observed compensatory movements were upper limb support on lower limbs/floor/handrail during all the tasks and lumbar hyperlordosis, trunk support on handrail, equinus foot, increased base of support, non-alternated descent, and pauses while climbing up/down steps.Climbing up/down steps showed a higher number of compensatory movements than sitting down on/rising from the floor, which seemed to be lost before climbing up/down steps in ambulatory children with DMD.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637975","annotations":[{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.566181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.33271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.106006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.100962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Climbing","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing"},{"name":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Magazine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Compensation (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensation_(psychology)"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Compensatory damages","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensatory_damages"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Gait (human)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_(human)"},{"name":"Dystrophin","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophin"},{"name":"Handrail","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handrail"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"}]}
