{"id":33313,"title":"One year outcome of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy using the Bayley-III scales of infant and toddler development.","abstract":"The pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy starts before birth. Despite this, clinical trials exclude young boys because traditional outcome measures rely on cooperation. We recently used the Bayley-III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development to study 24 infants and boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Clinical evaluators at six centers were trained and certified to perform the Bayley-III. Here, we report 6- and 12-month follow-up of two subsets of these boys.Nineteen boys (1.9 ± 0.8 years) were assessed at baseline and 6 months. Twelve boys (1.5 ± 0.8 years) were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months.Gross motor scores were lower at baseline compared with published controls (6.2 ± 1.7; normal 10 ± 3; P < 0.0001) and revealed a further declining trend to 5.7 ± 1.7 (P = 0.20) at 6 months. Repeated measures analysis of the 12 boys monitored for 12 months revealed that gross motor scores, again low at baseline (6.6 ± 1.7; P < 0.0001), declined at 6 months (5.9 ± 1.8) and further at 12 months (5.3 ± 2.0) (P = 0.11). Cognitive and language scores were lower at baseline compared with normal children (range, P = 0.002-<0.0001) and did not change significantly at 6 or 12 months (range, P = 0.89-0.09). Fine motor skills, also low at baseline, improved >1 year (P = 0.05).Development can reliably be measured in infants and young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy across time using the Bayley-III. Power calculations using these data reveal that motor development may be used as an outcome measure.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842254","annotations":[{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.702757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.666111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.591405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.449573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.222139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.218921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.208715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Fine motor skill","weight":0.164292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_motor_skill"},{"name":"Motor skill","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_skill"},{"name":"Gross motor skill","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_motor_skill"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"890","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/890"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Starting pitcher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
