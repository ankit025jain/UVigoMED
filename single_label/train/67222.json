{"id":67222,"title":"Dairy intake and semen quality among men attending a fertility clinic.","abstract":"To examine the relationship between dairy food intake and semen parameters.Longitudinal study.Academic medical center fertility clinic.One hundred fifty-five men.None.Total sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive motility, morphology, and semen volume.Low-fat dairy intake was positively related to sperm concentration and progressive motility. On average, men in the highest quartile of intake (1.22-3.54 servings/d) had 33% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1, 55) higher sperm concentration and 9.3 percentage units (95% CI 1.4, 17.2) higher sperm motility than men in the lowest quartile of intake (?0.28 servings/d). These associations were primarily explained by intake of low-fat milk. The corresponding results for low-fat milk were 30% (95% CI 1, 51) higher sperm concentration and 8.7 percentage units (95% CI 3.0, 14.4) higher sperm motility. Cheese intake was associated with lower sperm concentration among ever-smokers. In this group, men in the highest tertile of intake (0.82-2.43 servings/d) had 53.2% (95% CI 9.7, 75.7) lower sperm concentration than men in the lowest tertile of cheese intake (<0.43 servings/d).Our findings suggest that low-fat dairy intake, particularly low-fat milk, is related to higher sperm concentration and progressive motility, whereas cheese intake is related to lower sperm concentration among past or current smokers.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24636397","annotations":[{"name":"Motility","weight":0.712904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.470553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.46853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.407807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.357381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cheese","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese"},{"name":"Fertility clinic","weight":0.144571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_clinic"},{"name":"Semen quality","weight":0.144571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_quality"},{"name":"Eating","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.127937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Sperm motility","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_motility"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"822","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/822"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Quantile","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Diet food","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_food"}]}
