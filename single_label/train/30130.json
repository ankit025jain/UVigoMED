{"id":30130,"title":"A pipeline to extract drug-adverse event pairs from multiple data sources.","abstract":"Pharmacovigilance aims to uncover and understand harmful side-effects of drugs, termed adverse events (AEs). Although the current process of pharmacovigilance is very systematic, the increasing amount of information available in specialized health-related websites as well as the exponential growth in medical literature presents a unique opportunity to supplement traditional adverse event gathering mechanisms with new-age ones.We present a semi-automated pipeline to extract associations between drugs and side effects from traditional structured adverse event databases, enhanced by potential drug-adverse event pairs mined from user-comments from health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts. The pipeline was tested using a set of 12 drugs representative of two previous studies of adverse event extraction from health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts.Testing the pipeline shows that mining non-traditional sources helps substantiate the adverse event databases. The non-traditional sources not only contain the known AEs, but also suggest some unreported AEs for drugs which can then be analyzed further.A semi-automated pipeline to extract the AE pairs from adverse event databases as well as potential AE pairs from non-traditional sources such as text from MEDLINE abstracts and user-comments from health-related websites is presented.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559132","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.57511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.570782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.308892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.0474673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0256365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"American English","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English"},{"name":"Pipeline transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport"},{"name":"Abstract (summary)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)"},{"name":"Liquid-liquid extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-liquid_extraction"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Parent process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent_process"}]}
