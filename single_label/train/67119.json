{"id":67119,"title":"Prostate cancer and its mimics at multiparametric prostate MRI.","abstract":"One in six males will develop prostate cancer during their lifetime. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American males, behind only lung cancer. Unfortunately, even though this disease is so common, clinical screening methods such as prostate-specific antigen test and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy lack sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing prostate cancer. In recent years, multiparametric prostate MRI has emerged as a very important tool in the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma with a high accuracy. However, diagnostic difficulty is often encountered even with an experienced abdominal radiologist. That is mainly because many normal and abnormal entities can mimic prostate carcinoma at multiparametric MRI. Therefore, the purpose of this pictorial review is to discuss the usefulness of multiparametric prostate MRI in the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma, emphasizing the key MRI features that help to make a distinction of prostate carcinoma from its mimics.
