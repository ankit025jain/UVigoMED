{"id":66113,"title":"Calcium profiling in hemodiafiltration: a new way to reduce the calcium overload risk without compromising cardiovascular stability.","abstract":"Low and high dialysate calcium (Ca²?) content may have positive and harmful effects depending on the considered pathological aspect: hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrhythmias, parathormone release, adynamic bone disease, cardio-vascular calcifications. We hypothesized that a time-profiled Ca²? concentration would keep the cardiovascular advantages of high Ca²? but would reduce the risk of calcium overload.A prospective, multicenter study using a particular hemodiafiltration technique that allows the profiling of electrolytes was designed. Patients (n = 22) underwent randomly a 3-week dialysis session with low and high constant dialysate Ca²? (Ld(Ca,), 1.25 mM and Hd(Ca,), 2 mM) and profiled Ca²? (Pd(Ca)), respectively. Plasma and spent dialysate Ca²?, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (SAP, DAP) and QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) were analyzed.Plasma Ca²? concentration decreased in Ld(Ca), whereas it increased in Hd(Ca) and to a lesser extent, in Pd(Ca). Total amount of Ca²? given to the patient in Pd(Ca) (15.5 ± 1.0 mmol) was higher than in Ld(Ca) (4.3 ± 1.6 mmol) but lower than in Hd(Ca) (21.9 ± 3.3 mmol). SAP and DAP decreased in Ld(Ca), whereas it was almost constant in both Hd(Ca) and Pd(Ca·). QTc significantly increased, up to critical values (>460 msec), only during Ld(Ca·).Pd(Ca) seems to retain the advantages of high Ca²? in terms of hemodynamic stability and modification of QTc while reducing the excessive positive calcium balance typical of dialysis with high Ca²? content.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24744165","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.827645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.798873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.755333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Mole (unit)","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.608558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Hemofiltration","weight":0.556462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemofiltration"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.499321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.384048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.375523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.358033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.27899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.225669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.217062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Dystrophic calcification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystrophic_calcification"},{"name":"Strength training","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training"},{"name":"Renal osteodystrophy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_osteodystrophy"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"}]}
