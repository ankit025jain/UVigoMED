{"id":82027,"title":"Dentinal hypersensitivity: a narrative review.","abstract":"Dentinal hypersensitivity is an exaggerated response to a sensory stimulus that usually causes no response in a normal healthy tooth. It is a source of chronic irritation that can severely affect an individual's eating and drinking habits. The management of tooth hypersensitivity by oral healthcare professionals requires an appreciation of the complexity of the problem together with knowledge of available treatments.To review the symptoms, contributing oral factors, prevalence, measurement and mechanisms of dentinal hypersensitivity, together with current and potential future therapies for the condition.Narrative literature review.The permeability and fluid movement in open, exposed dentinal tubules has provided a favoured theory for stimulus transmission through dentine. Occlusion of dentinal tubules has been identified as a potential method of reducing pain associated with sensitive teeth. Current treatments work to occlude dentinal tubules. However these treatments can be expensive and their effects are often transient. In comparison, future therapies could be based upon either laser or iontophoresis techniques.Future therapies may provide a more permanent and cost effective way of treating dentinal hypersensitivity for health care professionals and their patients.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741888","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.621059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.585396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.432677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Iontophoresis","weight":0.421983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iontophoresis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.261025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.0565179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Treatment of Tourette syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_Tourette_syndrome"},{"name":"Potential method","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_method"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Narrative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Dentine hypersensitivity","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentine_hypersensitivity"}]}
