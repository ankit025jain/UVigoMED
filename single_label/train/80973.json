{"id":80973,"title":"[Sequential implementing farmland consolidation and replacing cattle with machine to control schistosomiasis].","abstract":"To evaluate the schistosomiasis control effect of sequential farmland consolidation and replacing bovine with machine.Two farmlands of Qianjiang City were selected as experimental districts, and the sequential implementing farmland consolidation and replacing bovine with machine were carried out. The schistosomiasis epidemic situation was observed continuously.From 2008 to 2012, the human schistosome infection rate decreased by 78.90%, in which the seropositive rate decreased by 47.88% (chi2 = 368.58, P < 0.01) and the stool positive rate decreased by 55.88% (chi2 = 29.92, P < 0.01). The schistosome infection rate of cattle was 2.54% in 2008, but from 2009, there were no cattle in the area. The Oncomelania snail area decreased by 54.78%, and the rate of frames with living snails and the mean density of living snails decreased by 76.49% and 72.63% (chi2 = 11.34, 12.86, P < 0.01) respectively. Since 2009, no infected snails were found.The sequential implementing farmland consolidation and replacing cattle with machine can effectively control the transmission of schistosomiasis.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490376","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.660473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.554805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.315437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0930287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.0771531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.0626171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Arable land","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable_land"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Sequence alignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment"},{"name":"Steam locomotive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive"},{"name":"Districts of Peru","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Peru"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
