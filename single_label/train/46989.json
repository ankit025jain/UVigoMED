{"id":46989,"title":"National program of colorectal carcinoma early detection in Brod-Posavina County (east Croatia).","abstract":"Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a major public health problem as the third leading malignant tumor in men and fourth in women in Croatia. Prognosis and treatment greatly depend on tumor stage at the time of detection. Therefore, the National Program of Colorectal Carcinoma Early Detection has been performed since 2007. The aim is to present the response rate, colonoscopy findings and number of newly detected CRC cases in Brod-Posavina County. During five years of the National Program performance, 28 CRC cases were detected in Brod-Posavina County, with the 3.3% rate of carcinoma detection. The majority of CRC cases were found in the 50-64 age group. The response rate in the County was low (20.4%), corresponding to the national rate but far from the recommended one. Such a result could be attributed to the low level of awareness in the population at large, complex testing technique for general population, fear from disease detection and from colonoscopy as a diagnostic procedure. Note should be made of the underestimated role of family physicians; their involvement in the National Program should certainly result in better response rate in our County as well as at the national level.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611338","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.886648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.772433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.66223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.645335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.502345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.455267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Croatia","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Costa Rica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
