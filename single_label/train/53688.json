{"id":53688,"title":"Glucose absorption in small intestinal diseases.","abstract":"Recent developments in the field of diabetes and obesity management have established the central role of the gut in glucose homeostasis; not only is the gut the primary absorptive site, but it also triggers neurohumoral feedback responses that regulate the pre- and post-absorptive phases of glucose metabolism. Structural and/or functional disorders of the intestine have the capacity to enhance (e.g.: diabetes) or inhibit (e.g.: short-gut syndrome, critical illness) glucose absorption, with potentially detrimental outcomes. In this review, we first describe the normal physiology of glucose absorption and outline the methods by which it can be quantified. Then we focus on the structural and functional changes in the small intestine associated with obesity, critical illness, short gut syndrome and other malabsorptive states, and particularly Type 2 diabetes, which can impact upon carbohydrate absorption and overall glucose homeostasis.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502537","annotations":[{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.462754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.235532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.212676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Structural biology","weight":0.108106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.01992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Functional disorder","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_disorder"}]}
