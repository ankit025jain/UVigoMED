{"id":27875,"title":"[Intentional poisoning of two wives by their husband?].","abstract":"The authors report on the death of two women who were married to the same man one after the other. Exhumation and toxicological investigation of the first wife, who had died 7 years before, did not produce any conclusive evidence of homicide. With regard to the circumstances of death of the second wife the husband made different statements. According to the result of the chemical and toxicological investigations death was caused by acute intoxication with the beta-blocker metoprolol. The man was found guilty of killing on request (which is a criminal offence in Germany) by administering the beta-blocker metoprolol through a transnasal gastric tube.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122992","annotations":[{"name":"Germany","weight":0.761433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Homicide","weight":0.563698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.423902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.230791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.205318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.156268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Offence (law)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offence_(law)"},{"name":"Beta blocker","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"},{"name":"Metoprolol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metoprolol"},{"name":"Wife","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Request stop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_stop"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Exhumation","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhumation"},{"name":"Bigamy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigamy"},{"name":"Combined drug intoxication","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_drug_intoxication"}]}
