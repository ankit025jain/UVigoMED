{"id":50190,"title":"Comparison of various adiposity indexes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and normo-ovulatory non-hirsute women: a population-based study.","abstract":"Insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic disorders are common in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, it is still not clear which adiposity marker could precisely predict metabolic syndrome (MetS) in women with PCOS and whether these indexes are different in normo-ovulatory non-hirsute women.A case-control study was conducted on a total of 175 Iranian subjects with PCOS and 525 normal control subjects, aged 18-45 years.Waist circumference (WC), BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, lipid accumulation product (LAP) index, and visceral adiposity index (VAI) were examined and the homeostasis model assessment index was calculated. MetS was defined according to the joint interim statement. The receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the extent to which measures of adiposity can predict IR and MetS risk.LAP index and VAI are two indicators (sensitivity and PPV of 70% (LAP index) and 60% (VAI), and 80% (LAP index) and 83% (VAI) respectively) that best predict IR in women with PCOS. Among healthy women, the LAP index and WC were better markers (sensitivity and PPV of 78% (LAP index) and 75% (VAI), and 82% (LAP index) and 81% (VAI) respectively). The two most reliable indicators for prediction of MetS among PCOS and normal women were the WC and VAI (sensitivity and PPV of 83% (WC) and 81% (VAI), and 97% (WC) and 95% (VAI) respectively) and the VAI and LAP index (sensitivity and PPV of 88% (VAI) and 83% (LAP index), and 98% (VAI) and 98% (LAP index) respectively) respectively.While the appropriate adiposity indicators and their optimum cutoff values vary in women with PCOS, compared with the normal control subjects, the LAP index is an easily obtainable index that might be useful for screening of cardiometabolic complications among both groups.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816947","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin
