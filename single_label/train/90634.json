{"id":90634,"title":"Sox11 promotes endogenous neurogenesis and locomotor recovery in mice spinal cord injury.","abstract":"We introduced a lentiviral vector containing the Sox11 gene into injured spinal cords of mice to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Sox11 in spinal cord injury. Sox11 markedly improved locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury and this recovery was accompanied by an up-regulation of Nestin/Doublecortin expression in the injured spinal cord. Sox11 was mainly located in endogenous neural stem cells lining the central canal and in newly-generated neurons in the spinal cord. In addition, Sox 11 significantly induced expressions of BDNF in the spinal cords of LV-Sox11-treated mice. We concluded that Sox11 induced activation of endogenous neural stem cells into neuronal determination and migration within the injured spinal cord. The resultant increase of BDNF at the injured site might form a distinct neurogenic niche which induces a final neuronal differentiation of these neural stem cells. Enhancing Sox11 expression to induce neurogenic differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells after injury may be a promising strategy in restorative therapy after SCI in mammals.
