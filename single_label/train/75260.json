{"id":75260,"title":"Parkinson disease: Can a new trial end controversy over when to use levodopa?","abstract":"Levodopa is the standard therapy for Parkinson disease, but prolonged use promotes the development of adverse motor effects. A new trial compared the effectiveness of levodopa administration early in the disease with therapies that used alternative dopaminergic agents before levodopa. No clinically relevant differences were found between the treatment strategies.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134709","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.637649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"L-DOPA","weight":0.403889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.115427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Internal combustion engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Can (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)"},{"name":"New trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_trial"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"}]}
