{"id":52393,"title":"Unilateral ovarian agenesis and clear cell type epithelioid leiomyoma of uterus mimicking ovarian malignancy.","abstract":"A case of unilateral absent ovary together with clear cell type epithelioid leiomyoma of uterus mimicking ovarian malignancy discovered during laparotomy is presented. Unilateral absence of an ovary is an extremely rare finding. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanism is not known, it could result from a defect in embryological development or asymptomatic torsion of ovary. Clear cell type epithelioid leiomyoma of uterus is also a rare variant, composed of round or polygonal 'clear' cells rather than typical spindle-shaped cells and ultra structurally differs from non-uterine counterparts.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605720","annotations":[{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.795841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Embryology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryology"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.744401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.687633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.572136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.47494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.411315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.262222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Agenesis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenesis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Polygon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon"},{"name":"Testicular torsion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_torsion"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
