{"id":37315,"title":"[Why use long-term macrolide therapy in pediatric pulmonology?].","abstract":"Macrolides are well-known antibiotics exerting antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Since the observation of a dramatic improvement in lung disease and survival in patients with diffuse panbronchiolitis, macrolides have been used over the long term in several chronic respiratory diseases. This review describes the results of trials that have evaluated long-term macrolides in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, and asthma, particularly focusing on the impact on children. It also provides new insights on the potential effects of macrolides on diffuse parenchymal lung diseases.
