{"id":69280,"title":"Uroflowmetry in a large population of Brazilian men submitted to a health check up program and its correlation with IPSS and prostate size.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the uroflowmetry data in a large population of asymptomatic Brazilian men submitted to a health check up program and their correlation to IPSS and prostate size.Asymptomatic men underwent a health check-up program between January and December 2012. The inclusion criteria were men between 40 and 70 years, IPSS ? 7, without bladder, prostate, urethral surgery, neurological diseases, urinary tract infection, PSA < 4.0 ng/dL and urinary volume higher than 150 mL. Urological assessment consisted of clinical history, IPSS, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate specific antigen (PSA), urinalysis, ultrasonography and uroflowmetry.A total of 1041 asymptomatic men were included in this study. The average age was 49 years and average maximum flow rate was 17.4 mL/s. In spite of IPSS and prostate size increase with aging, they had a weak correlation with Qmax cutoffs (10 mL/s and 15 mL/s). A total of 85 men (8.3%) had more than 60 years, and even in this group, Qmax was higher than 15 mL/s. Out of 1041 men, 117 had IPSS less than 8 and Qmax less than 10 mL/s.In asymptomatic men there is a weak correlation between IPSS, prostate size and uroflowmetric data. The establishment of different normal cutoffs seems to be complicated and uroflowmetry data should be interpreted with caution in order to avoid misdiagnosis.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456775","annotations":[{"name":"Rectal examination","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectal_examination"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Urinalysis","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinalysis"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.875198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.45839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Urine flow rate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine_flow_rate"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
