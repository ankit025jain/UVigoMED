{"id":35570,"title":"Improvement in LDL-cholesterol levels of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia: can we do better? Analysis of results obtained during the past two decades in 1669 French subjects.","abstract":"Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (heFH) is an autosomal disease that affects about 1/500 people. It is characterized by markedly elevated plasma LDL-cholesterol (C) levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to measure changes in LDL-C levels in heFH patients over two decades, and to evaluate if patients achieved LDL-C targets.Data from 1669 heFH patients in five academic French centers were recorded between 1988 and 2011.The mean LDL-C concentrations under medical care improved between 1988 and 2011 (245 mg/dL before 1995, 164 mg/dL after 2009; p < 0.0001). However, mean LDL-C level and the number of patients treated with statins (79.3%) have not improved since 2005. In patients registered and treated after 2005 (n = 616), only 10.4% reached target LDL-C levels of <100 mg/dL. Indeed, 29.4% (n = 181) were treated with a maximal therapy (statins with a potency of >45% LDL-C reduction plus at least another lipid-lowering agent). Despite maximal treatment, only 18.8% of these heFH patients (n = 34/181) reached target LDL-C levels of <100 mg/dL. In addition, 75.3% of patients with CVD did not reach the LDL-C of <100 mg/dL.This study demonstrates that after significant improvement over the past two decades, the mean LDL-C levels in heFH French patients has remained stable since 2005. We also show that most heFH patients are not achieving their recommended LDL-C goals: this highlights the need for improved treatment and for new therapeutics in this population.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637413","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.813282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.803783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.723523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.472295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.43674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.35394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"France","weight":0.329453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.304854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.273852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Familial hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.0922799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"1500","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"1669","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1669"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Mac OS X Tiger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Tiger"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
