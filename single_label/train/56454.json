{"id":56454,"title":"Suppression of retinal neovascularization by small interfering RNA targeting PGC-1?.","abstract":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? coactivator-1? (PGC-1?) is a key coordinator of gene programs in metabolism and energy homeostasis in mammals. The aim of this study was to determine whether PGC-1? is involved in the transcriptional regulation of retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). The expression of PGC-1? in the retina of mice with OIR was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot analysis. Mice with OIR were administered small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PGC-1? by intravitreal injection, and the effects of PGC-1? siRNA were confirmed by fluorescein angiography and quantification of pre-retinal neovascular nuclei in the retinal sections. PGC-1? was upregulated at both the mRNA and protein level under hypoxic conditions. Retinal neovascularization was inhibited by PGC-1? siRNA. Furthermore, PGC-1? mRNA and protein levels were also reduced by PGC-1? siRNA, which were detected by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. The downregulation of PGC-1? expression resulted in the reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the mice. In conclusion, siRNA targeting PGC-1? inhibits retinal neovascularization by downregulating the expression of PGC-1? and VEGF in the murine retina. Therefore, PGC-1? represents a potential therapeutic target for ischemia-induced retinal diseases and other ocular neovascular diseases.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Eye
