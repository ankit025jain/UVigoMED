{"id":34405,"title":"Mutation screening of TSC1 and TSC2 genes in Chinese Han children with tuberous sclerosis complex.","abstract":"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant neurogenetic disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and is frequently associated with hamartoma formation in multiple organ systems. Here, we report two novel mutations in the TSC2 gene, including a splicing mutation (IVS 29 +1G>C) in intron 29 and a deletion/insertion mutation (C.5090-5092delCCA- inAG) in exon 39 in two Chinese Han children with TSC whose first clinical manifestation was seizure. The identification of these two mutations confirmed the diagnosis of TSC and expands the spectrum of TSC2 mutations causing TSC.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24737435","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Autosomal dominant","weight":0.819649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosomal_dominant"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.754552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Intron","weight":0.674607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.567274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.533539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.526182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.513105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tuberous sclerosis","weight":0.488317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberous_sclerosis"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hamartoma","weight":0.273382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.205801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"TSC2","weight":0.124684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSC2"},{"name":"TSC1","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSC1"},{"name":"Biological system","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Neurogenetics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenetics"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"International Valuation Standards Committee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Valuation_Standards_Committee"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Tuber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuber"}]}
