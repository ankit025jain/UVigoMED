{"id":26583,"title":"Custom-made fenestrated stent grafts to preserve accessory renal arteries in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms.","abstract":"Accessory renal arteries are common and may contribute significantly to renal perfusion. With the current endovascular design and technology, it is possible to preserve accessory renal arteries during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We report two patients with custom-made EVAR devices to preserve accessory renal arteries with good mid- and long-term clinical and radiological results. Conventional EVAR would have occluded their origins. As a result of customized fenestrations in commercially available stentgrafts, the patency of large accessory renal arteries can be maintained, whilst securing a proximal seal.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102708","annotations":[{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.639022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.611753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.455534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.419782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.237819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Pinniped","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped"},{"name":"Accessory nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_nerve"},{"name":"Accessory (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_(band)"},{"name":"Fenestra","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenestra"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Design and Technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_and_Technology"}]}
