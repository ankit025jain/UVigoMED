{"id":86741,"title":"Imaging in pulmonary hypertension: Focus on the role of echocardiography.","abstract":"Patients with pulmonary hypertension must be evaluated using a multimodality approach to ensure a correct diagnosis and basal evaluation as well as a prognostic assessment. Beyond the assessment of pulmonary pressures, the echocardiographical examination allows the evaluation of right ventricular adaptation to elevated afterload. Numbers of variables are commonly used in the assessment of the pulmonary hypertension patient in order to detect changes in right heart geometry, right-to-left interaction and right ventricular dysfunction. Whereas an isolated change in one echocardiographical variable is not meaningful, multiple echocardiographical variable modifications together provide accurate information. In this review, we will link pulmonary hypertension pathophysiological changes with echocardiographical indices and describe the clinical implications of echocardiographical findings.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746538","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.77878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.637187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Right heart","weight":0.285902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_heart"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.208715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Afterload","weight":0.0419679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterload"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0172523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Book of Numbers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
