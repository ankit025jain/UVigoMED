{"id":38452,"title":"Vitamin D status in children with cystic fibrosis. Associations with inflammation and bacterial colonization.","abstract":"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have high rates of vitamin D insufficiency. The relation between vitamin D status and inflammation in patients with CF is poorly understood.To determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in a young CF population and to examine correlations between vitamin D status, disease severity, and inflammatory markers.This was a retrospective chart review of patients with CF under the age of 12 years. Serum laboratory parameters, growth indices, pancreatic status, CFTR genetics, medications, microbiology, and presence of CF-related comorbidities were collected for patients who had fat-soluble vitamin levels measured between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/ml and insufficiency as serum 25(OH)D 20 to 29.9 ng/ml. Associations between serum vitamin D concentration and clinical/inflammatory markers were assessed using Chi-square and t tests.Data were collected for 148 children. The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 32.4 ng/ml (SD, 8.9). Seven percent (10 of 148) were vitamin D deficient, and 36% (53 of 148) were vitamin D insufficient. Among the pancreatic-sufficient patients, 50% (14 of 28) were vitamin D insufficient/deficient, whereas among pancreatic-insufficient patients, 41% (49 of 120) were vitamin D insufficient/deficient. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was a more common pathogen in the patients who were vitamin D insufficient/deficient (18 of 63 vs. 11 of 85, P = 0.018). There was no difference between vitamin D-sufficient versus -insufficient groups in terms of other bacterial colonization or inflammatory markers.Overall, vitamin D insufficiency is common among young children with CF. Vitamin D insufficiency is prevalent even in children who are pancreatic sufficient. In this population, vitamin D insufficiency is associated with a history of Pseudomonas colonization but not with classic markers of systemic inflammation.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423241","annotations":[{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.928562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.847232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.727918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.702836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.693722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.556612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.530283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.51126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.342427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Colony (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_(biology)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","weight":0.0639323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"Colonization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization"},{"name":"Hypovitaminosis D","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovitaminosis_D"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
