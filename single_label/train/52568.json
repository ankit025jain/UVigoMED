{"id":52568,"title":"[Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel switching in smooth muscle participates in atherosclerosis development in diabetic rats].","abstract":"To investigate the changes in aorta morphology and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (KCa) channel expression in the diabetic rats.A diabetic rat model was established by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg) after a modified high fat and glucose diet for 8 weeks. Pathological changes in the aorta were observed with HE staining, elastic fiber staining, Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry. Both the mRNA and protein levels of KCa channels in the aorta were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting.Early atherosclerotic changes were observed in the aorta wall of the diabetic rats. The mRNA and protein levels of KCa1.1 channel ?- and ?-subunits were significantly decreased, while the expression of KCa3.1 channels was obviously enhanced in the middle layer of the aorta in the diabetic rats.KCa channel switching in smooth muscles may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis in diabetic rats.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589593","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Elastic fiber","weight":0.835959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_fiber"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.774734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.483118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Streptozotocin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptozotocin"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Masson's trichrome stain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masson's_trichrome_stain"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"}]}
