{"id":28106,"title":"Electroencephalographic abnormalities and 5-year outcome in first-episode psychosis.","abstract":"To examine the relation of electroencephalographic abnormalities to 5-year outcomes in first-episode psychosis (FEP).Patients (n = 103) had their baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) classified by modified Mayo Clinic criteria. Symptoms and psychosocial functioning were rated after 5 years of treatment.Dysrhythmic EEG was associated with persistence in positive and negative symptoms of psychoses and poorer psychosocial functioning at 5-year follow-up, independently of other characteristics, such as duration of untreated illness or premorbid adjustment. A higher percentage of people with comorbid substance use disorder had normal EEG.Abnormal baseline EEG in FEP is associated with poorer 5-year symptomatic and functional outcome.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007282","annotations":[{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Psychosis","weight":0.851775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Mayo Clinic","weight":0.797289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.642352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.639347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.590766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.531421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.177566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Fluorinated ethylene propylene","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinated_ethylene_propylene"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"}]}
