{"id":26569,"title":"[Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 serum levels in patients from different categories of cardiovascular risk].","abstract":"To compare levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in blood serum of patients from different cardiovascular risk categories.Patients from Moscow prospective study database (n = 519) were divided into 4 cardiovascular risk categories according to present clinical recommendations (low, moderate, high, very high). Measurement of Lp-PLA2 concentration (mass) was performed using PLAC Test ELISA Kit. Measurement of Lp-PLA2 activity was made using PLAC Test for Lp-PLA2 Activity. Blood serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and uric acid were also determined.Preliminary analysis showed that associations between Lp-PLA2 mass and activity became more obvious in patients not treated with statins and patients without diabetes mellitus. So patients receiving statins and diabetics were excluded from final analysis. Lp-PLA2 mass and activity were lower in low cardiovascular risk category patients. There were no significant differences in Lp-PLA2 mass and activity between patients from moderate, high and very high risk categories. There was moderate correlation between Lp-PLA2 mass and Lp-PLA2 activity (r = 0.38, p < 0.00001). We did not find any correlation between Lp-PLA2 and hsCRP, Lp(a) levels, but detected moderate correlation between Lp-PLA2 mass and activity and TC, LDL-C. We also found a mild positive correlation between Lp-PLA2 mass and HDL-C levels. There was a positive correlation between Lp-PLA2 activity and TG, uric acid and negative correlation between Lp-PLA2 activity and HDL-C levels.In this group of nondiabetic patients not treated with statins both Lp-PLA2 activity and mass were similarly related to categories of cardiovascular risk.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102750","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood serum","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_serum"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.78748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Phospholipase A2","weight":0.682648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_A2"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.540748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.500559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.245686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"}]}
