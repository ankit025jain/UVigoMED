{"id":80743,"title":"Mansonella ozzardi (Nematoda: Onchocercidae) in the riverine population of the Tefé River, State of Amazonia, Brazil.","abstract":"This study assessed the prevalence of Mansonella ozzardi in riverine communities of the Tefé River, Amazonas, Brazil.The prevalence of M. ozzardi was estimated by microscopic examination of thick blood smears.The M. ozzardi prevalence rate was 6.3% (19/300). Filarial infection was found in 8 of the 11 communities surveyed, with prevalence rates varying from 2.5% to 22.2%.Tefé is a region of oil and natural gas exploration, in which there is a high turnover of workers. Migration patterns may facilitate the dissemination of mansonelliasis to other regions.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553803","annotations":[{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.766577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Amazon Rainforest","weight":0.728218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest"},{"name":"Natural gas","weight":0.684821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.556969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.43096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Amazonas (Brazilian state)","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazonas_(Brazilian_state)"},{"name":"River","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.158969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Filariasis","weight":0.118284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filariasis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Mansonella perstans","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansonella_perstans"},{"name":"Mansonelliasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansonelliasis"},{"name":"Hydrocarbon exploration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon_exploration"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Revenue","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue"},{"name":"Dissemination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissemination"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"}]}
