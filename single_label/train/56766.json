{"id":56766,"title":"Massive exudative retinal detachment following photodynamic therapy for retinal hemangioma in von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome.","abstract":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a common treatment on retinal capillary hemangioma. We applied PDT to a patient with von Hippel-Lindau(VHL) syndrome and she developed severe massive exudative retinal detachment the next day, which is a rare complication for PDT. After intraocular anti-VEGF agent and peribulbar dexamethasone several times to the patient, her subretinal fluid disappeared and hemangiomas atrophied. Treatment with Anti-VEGF agent and corticosteroid is effective for such complication.
