{"id":27735,"title":"Yin and Yang: unsilencing synapses to control cocaine seeking.","abstract":"In this issue of Neuron, Ma et al. (2014) show that long-term depression of two independent prefrontal cortical inputs to nucleus accumbens modifies behavioral responses controlling incubation of cocaine craving. Intriguingly, one input increases while the other attenuates behavioral responses, hinting that both \"prorelapse\" and \"antirelapse\" pathways are strengthened after cocaine self-administration.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25233302","annotations":[{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.605897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Nucleus accumbens","weight":0.554984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.451803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.239976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Prefrontal cortex","weight":0.137115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Font hinting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting"},{"name":"Craving (withdrawal)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craving_(withdrawal)"},{"name":"Incubation (ritual)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_(ritual)"}]}
