{"id":78379,"title":"Topical nasal lysine aspirin in aspirin-sensitive and aspirin-tolerant chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis.","abstract":"Chronic rhinosinusitis patients with nasal polyps can be aspirin sensitive or aspirin tolerant. The majority belong to the latter group. They tolerate intake of aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, whereas aspirin-sensitive patients have an adverse reaction (asthma, rhinitis and/or urticaria). Diagnosis of aspirin sensitivity is important for the patient, but is rarely undertaken in routine ENT or respiratory medicine practice. Treatment of nasal polyps is by a combination of medical therapy and surgery. Oral and topical steroids form the mainstay of medical therapy, which is aimed at reducing inflammation and symptom improvement. Surgery helps with polyps causing severe nasal obstruction. Despite these therapies, recurrences are common in aspirin sensitive patients. Any adjunctive therapy to prevent or prolong recurrence would be welcome. One such possibility is topical nasal lysine-aspirin. This is an area under current debate and this non-systematic review aims to provide evidence of its use, to date, in aspirin sensitive and aspirin tolerant nasal polyp patients.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684687","annotations":[{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.765382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.753341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.718269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.705078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.6891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Lysine","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.55181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.437795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Nasal polyp","weight":0.293056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp"},{"name":"Salicylate sensitivity","weight":0.242024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylate_sensitivity"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0512665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Polyposis","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyposis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
