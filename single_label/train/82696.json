{"id":82696,"title":"Genipin inhibits IL-1?-induced CCL20 and IL-6 production from human periodontal ligament cells.","abstract":"Genipin, the aglycon of geniposide found in gardenia fruit has long been considered for treatment of various diseases in traditional oriental medicine. Genipin has been used as a blue colorant in food industry. Genipin has recently been reported to have some pharmacological functions, such as antimicrobial, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to examine whether genipin could modify CCL20 and IL-6, which are related to bone resorption in periodontal disease, expression in human periodontal ligament cells (HPDLCs).CCL20 and IL-6 productions from HPDLCs were determined by ELISA. Western blot analysis was used for the detection of signal transduction molecules expressions in HPDLCs.Genipin prevented IL-1?-mediated CCL20 and IL-6 production in HPDLCs. Moreover, genipin could suppress nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) p65, extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) phosphorylations in IL-1?-stimulated HPDLCs. NF-?B inhibitor and ERK inhibitor significantly inhibited IL-6 and CCL20 productions from IL-1?-stimulated HPDLCs.These data provide a novel mechanism through which genipin could be used to provide direct benefits in periodontal disease to inhibit IL-6 and CCL20 productions in periodontal lesions.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Stomatognathic
