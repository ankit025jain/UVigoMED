{"id":63197,"title":"Focal adhesion protein expression in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","abstract":"Focal adhesions have been associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types, but their prognostic value in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression patterns and the prognostic value of the focal adhesion proteins FAK, Pyk2, p130Cas and HEF1 in DLBCL.Focal adhesion protein expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in normal lymphoid tissues and in 60 DLBCL patient samples. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the correlation of focal adhesion protein expression with patient prognosis. FAK, Pyk2, p130Cas and HEF1 expression was mostly found in the germinal centres of normal human lymphoid tissues. When assessed in DLBCL samples, FAK, Pyk2, p130Cas and HEF1 were highly expressed in 45%, 34%, 42% and 45% of the samples, respectively. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that decreased FAK expression was a significant independent predictor of poorer disease outcome.FAK expression is an independent prognostic factor in DLBCL. Our results suggest that the addition of FAK immunostaining to the current immunohistochemical algorithms may facilitate risk stratification of DLBCL patients.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467224","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.79786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.772597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.740728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.550962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.540941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.436156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.303908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.167475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.151332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"PTK2","weight":0.138662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTK2"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.121041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"BCAR1","weight":0.117191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCAR1"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Focal adhesion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_adhesion"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"PTK2B","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTK2B"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"}]}
