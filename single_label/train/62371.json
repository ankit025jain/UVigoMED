{"id":62371,"title":"Complex IGH rearrangements in multiple myeloma: Frequent detection discrepancies among three different probe sets.","abstract":"Primary IGH translocations involving seven recurrent partner loci and oncogenes are present in about 40% of multiple myeloma tumors. Secondary IGH rearrangements, which occur in a smaller fraction of tumors, usually are complex structures, including insertions or translocations that can involve three chromosomes, and often with involvement of MYC. The main approach to detect IGH rearrangements is interphase-but sometimes metaphase-FISH strategies that use a telomeric variable region probe and a centromeric constant region/ E? enhancer or 3' flanking probe to detect a separation of these two probes, or a fusion of these probes with probes located at nonrandom partner sites in the genome. We analyzed 18 myeloma cell lines for detection discrepancies among Vysis, Cytocell, and in-house IGH probe sets that hybridize with differing sequences in the IGH locus. There were no detection discrepancies for the three telomeric IGH probes, or for unrearranged IGH loci or primary IGH translocations using the centromeric IGH probes. However, the majority of complex IGH rearrangements had detection discrepancies among the three centromeric IGH probes.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585545","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Insertion (genetics)","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Variable region","weight":0.728216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_region"},{"name":"Telomere","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Enhancer (genetics)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_(genetics)"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.363352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Flanking maneuver","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanking_maneuver"},{"name":"IGH@","weight":0.0152416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGH@"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
