{"id":29720,"title":"The use of the ADHD self-rating scale (ASRS-6) in the homeless: psychometric properties, alcohol use, and self-nurse agreement.","abstract":"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is prevalent in homeless populations, but no studies have assessed the psychometric properties of assessment instruments for this population.Self-other agreement on the ADHD Self-Rating Scale 6 was studied using a cohort of admissions to an outreach clinic for the homeless (n = 72). Alcohol use was assessed with the fast alcohol screening test. Other drug use was assessed by interview.For the six-item ASRS-6, the self-nurse correlation was .63 (p < .001). Discriminant correlations were low. Higher ASRS-6 scores as rated by both nurse and self-report were associated with illicit drug use but not alcohol problems. Concordance was lower at higher levels of alcohol problems (p < .05) CONCLUSION: The observations of experienced nurses converge well with self-reported symptoms of ADHD. Further research is needed to assess the relative contribution of clinical observation and self-report in assessing homeless patients.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621489","annotations":[{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.606228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.554015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.462795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.400503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.379482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.299842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.140725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
