{"id":75498,"title":"A modified Imhäuser osteotomy: an assessment of the addition of an open femoral neck osteoplasty.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine whether an osteoplasty of the femoral neck performed at the same time as an intertrochanteric Imhäuser osteotomy led to an improved functional outcome or increased morbidity. A total of 20 hips in 19 patients (12 left, 8 right, 13 male, 6 female), who underwent an Imhäuser intertrochanteric osteotomy following a slipped capital femoral epiphysis were assessed over an eight-year period. A total of 13 hips in 13 patients had an osteoplasty of the femoral neck at the same time. The remaining six patients (seven hips) had intertrochanteric osteotomy alone. The mean age was 15.3 years (13 to 20) with a mean follow-up of 57.8 months (15 to 117); 19 of the slips were severe (Southwick grade III) and one was moderate (grade II), with a mean slip angle of 65.3° (50° to 80°); 17 of the slips were stable and three unstable at initial presentation. The mean Non-Arthritic Hip Scores (NAHS) in patients who underwent osteoplasty was 91.7 (76.3 to 100) and the mean NAHS in patients who did not undergo osteoplasty was 76.6 (41.3 to 100) (p = 0.056). Two patients required a subsequent arthroplasty and neither of these patients had an osteoplasty. No hips developed osteonecrosis or chondrolysis, and there was no increase in complications related to the osteoplasty. We recommend that for patients with a slipped upper femoral epiphysis undergoing an intertrochanteric osteotomy, the addition of an osteoplasty of the femoral neck should be considered.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086130","annotations":[{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.493667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.467821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.323266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.298737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.251491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.231345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.104316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Slip angle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_angle"},{"name":"Slipped capital femoral epiphysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipped_capital_femoral_epiphysis"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Fielding (cricket)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Capital city","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_city"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"National Art Honor Society","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Art_Honor_Society"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Uncial 056","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_056"}]}
