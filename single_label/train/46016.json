{"id":46016,"title":"The importance of gender in patients with peritoneal metastases of appendiceal origin treated by cytoreduction and intraperitoneal chemotherapy: an analysis of 257 consecutive patients from an Australian centre.","abstract":"In the setting of colorectal cancer, female gender has been associated with superior long-term outcomes. Our aim is to investigate the gender differences for metastatic epithelial neoplasms of the appendix treated by cytoreductive surgery (CS) and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC).The survival outcomes of patients treated with CS/IPC from 1996 to 2013 at St. George Hospital, Sydney, Australia, for peritoneal metastases of appendiceal origin were retrospectively analysed.Two hundred and fifty-seven consecutive patients were followed for a median of 35.3 months. Baseline characteristics between genders were comparable, including age (p = 0.13) and peritoneal cancer index (p = 0.94). Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached (NR) and 44.4 months, with a 3-, 5- and 10-year survival of 82, 74 and 64 %. OS and PFS for females was NR and 50.7 months, compared to NR (p = 0.007) and 31.5 months for males (p = 0.07). Three-, 5- and 10-year survival rates for females were 88, 84 and 72 % compared to 74, 61 and 53 % for males.Observed gender differences for neoplasms of the appendix may direct future research in gender-specific tumour markers and the development of adjuvant therapies to improve patient outcomes.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652408","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Primary peritoneal carcinoma","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_peritoneal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.777071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.746655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Vermiform appendix","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermiform_appendix"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.690137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.509272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.436874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Sydney","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0651984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1996","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
