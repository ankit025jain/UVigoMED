{"id":46728,"title":"The risk of colorectal cancer after an attack of uncomplicated diverticulitis.","abstract":"According to clinical guidelines, a colonoscopy is recommended after an attack of diverticulitis in order to exclude colorectal cancer (CRC). This is based on studies prior to the use of computerized tomography (CT) for confirmation of the diagnosis. We aimed to investigate the findings of a subsequent colonoscopy after an attack of uncomplicated diverticulitis.The study cohort consisted of all patients with the diagnosis of uncomplicated diverticulitis, who underwent a subsequent colonoscopy 6-8 weeks later during a 6-years period in the National University Hospital of Iceland. The diagnosis of diverticulitis was based on clinical symptoms verified with a CT of the abdomen. Relevant clinical information was obtained from medical records and from the Icelandic Cancer Registry.A total of 282 patients had uncomplicated diverticulitis and 199 patients underwent endoscopy. Two patients had CRC (0.7%), diagnosed with diverticulitis but did not recover clinically. All other patients recovered clinically. Colonic polyps were found in 33 of 195 (17%) cases. In 19/33 (58%) cases the histology demonstrated hyperplastic polyps, and in 13/33 (39%) adenoma with mild dysplasia. Only 1/33 (3%) of the colonic polyps were >1 cm in size.Among patients experiencing an attack of uncomplicated diverticulitis the frequency of CRC was equal to what might be expected compared to the average risk in the population. In these patients a routine colonoscopy in the absence of other clinical signs of CRC seems hardly necessary, if the clinical course is uneventful and the patient recovers.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621325","annotations":[{"name":"Diverticulitis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulitis"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.573334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.441371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.411358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Iceland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
