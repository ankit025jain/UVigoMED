{"id":47650,"title":"Long-term use of probiotics Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium has a prophylactic effect on the occurrence and severity of pouchitis: a randomized prospective study.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the long-term use of the composite probiotics in patients after restorative proctocolectomy.Forty-three patients (20 females and 23 males, aged 21 to 68 years) after restorative proctocolectomy were included in the study. After randomization patients were divided into placebo group and treatment group with oral intake of probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium bifidus. Patients were investigated during initial visit and during final visit after 9 months. All patients were subjected to standard clinical and endoscopic examination with microscopic study of the specimens. Concentrations of calprotectin and pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2-PK were determined in all cases.The average severity of pouchitis and the number of patients with pouchitis significantly decrease after 9 months of the probiotic taking. The concentrations of calprotectin and pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2-PK significantly decreased after the therapy.Nine months of the probiotic treatment (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium bifidus) reduced the number of patients with pouchitis, decreased the PDAI score, and also decreased the fecal pyruvate kinase and calprotectin. The long-term probiotics use is safe and well accepted and can be an effective method of the pouchitis prevention.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579075","annotations":[{"name":"Lactobacillus acidophilus","weight":0.865565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_acidophilus"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.844041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus","weight":0.757284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_delbrueckii_subsp._bulgaricus"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.753905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Lactobacillus","weight":0.7123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.680981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Pyruvic acid","weight":0.615205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvic_acid"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.49495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.489597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bifidobacterium","weight":0.396877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.171842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Pyruvate kinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvate_kinase"},{"name":"Pouchitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouchitis"},{"name":"Proctocolectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctocolectomy"},{"name":"Isozyme","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isozyme"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"}]}
