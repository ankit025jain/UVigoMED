{"id":73627,"title":"CD271+ osteosarcoma cells display stem-like properties.","abstract":"Cancer stem cell (CSC) theory has been proposed and verified in many cancers. The existence of osteosarcoma CSCs has been confirmed for many years and multiple surface markers have been employed to identify them. In this study, we identified CD271(+) subpopulation of osteosarcoma displaying stem-like properties. CD271, known as the neural crest nerve growth factor receptor, is the marker of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human melanoma-initiating cells. We discovered that CD271 was expressed differentially in diverse types of human osteosarcoma and stabilized cell lines. CD271(+) osteosarcoma cells displayed most of the properties of CSC, such as self-renewal, differentiation, drug resistance and tumorigenicity in vivo. Nanog, Oct3/4, STAT3, DNA-PKcs, Bcl-2 and ABCG2 were more expressed in CD271(+) cells compared with CD271- cells. Our study supported the osteosarcoma CSC hypothesis and, to a certain extent, revealed one of the possible mechanisms involved in maintaining CSCs properties.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893164","annotations":[{"name":"Nerve growth factor","weight":0.929752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_growth_factor"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Neural crest","weight":0.875996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_crest"},{"name":"Homeobox protein NANOG","weight":0.873144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox_protein_NANOG"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.798286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.736829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.637738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Subpopulation","weight":0.102975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpopulation"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"}]}
