{"id":9646,"title":"Experimental study of image-guided percutaneous microwave ablation in rabbit lung VX2 tumor model.","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous microwave ablation.Twenty-six rabbits with lung VX2 tumor were randomly divided into experimental and control group. In the experimental group, microwave ablation guided by ultrasound or CT was performed based on location of the tumor. Enhanced CT scan was carried out immediately before and after the ablation for all animals. Two animals from each group were sacrificed immediately or 1 week after the ablation respectively and the others were followed for the rest of their lives.CT scan revealed that the tumor was greatly reduced or ablated after ablation. Pathological examination immediately after ablation also confirmed the tumor reduction or ablation. The survival time of the animals in the experimental group was significantly longer than that in the control group.Microwave ablation is a safe and effective method for treating lung cancer in rabbits, showing potential clinical applicability.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696709","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.882315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.752843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.685924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.647072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Microwave","weight":0.543828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.499973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.475955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.301218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.273852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"VX (nerve agent)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX_(nerve_agent)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Filming location","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filming_location"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Human sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice"}]}
