{"id":52997,"title":"Clinical presentation and comparison of surgical outcome for segmental resection vs. Whipple's procedure for solid pseudopapillary tumor: Report of six new cases & literature review of 321 cases.","abstract":"Report 6 new cases of solid-pseudopapillary-pancreatic-tumor, comprehensively review 321 cases reported in American literature, and compare outcomes for segmental resection vs.. Whipple's procedure.Cases of solid-pseudopapillary-tumor at William Beaumont Hospital, 1999-2011, identified by computerized analysis of pathology reports. Comprehensive review of all American cases identified by computerized literature review. Segmental resection includes open/laparoscopic central pancreatectomy and anatomic distal pancreatectomy, but excludes enucleation.Six cases of solid-pseudopapillary-pancreatic-tumors (0.5% of all solid pancreatic lesions), occurred during 1999-2011 at the hospital. Mean age at diagnosis = 27.7 years. All 6 were female. All patients had abdominal pain. Mean symptom duration = 10.0 days. All patients had normal routine blood tests. Mean APACHE II score at diagnosis = 1.8. All six patients had single heterogeneous lesions, with cystic/solid components. All patients underwent surgery: segmental resection-4, Whipple's procedure-2. Tumors were uniformly diagnosed by surgically resected tissue. Mean tumor size = 5.7 cm. Mean postoperative length of stay = 4.0 days for segmental resection (N = 4) vs. 14.0 days for Whipple's procedure (N = 2). All 6 patients are alive and well to-date, without evident local recurrence or metastasis. In a literature review, 45 patients undergoing Whipple's procedure versus 34 patients undergoing segmental resection, had significantly longer mean postoperative hospitalization (16.4 vs. 4.3 days, p = 0.01), and had increased unadjusted mortality (20.2% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.018). However, this mortality difference became insignificant when adjusting for longer mean follow-up of Whipple's procedure patients (Kaplan-Meier-survival-curve, p = 0.75).This work suggests segmental resection of these pancreatic tumors localized to the body/tail may have a better surgical outcome than Whipple's procedure for tumors localized to the pancreatic head. Further studies are necessary.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555981","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Pancreatectomy","weight":0.731024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatectomy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.672562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.633844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.430036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.287876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Enucleation of the eye","weight":0.081755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enucleation_of_the_eye"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0495813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"APACHE II","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APACHE_II"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
