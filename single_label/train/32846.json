{"id":32846,"title":"Surgical treatment of aortic valve endocarditis: a 26-year experience.","abstract":"We have retrospectively analyzed the results of the operations made for aortic valve endocarditis in a single center in 26 years.From June 1985 to January 2011, 174 patients were operated for aortic valve endocarditis. One hundred and thirty-eight (79.3%) patients were male and the mean age was 39.3±14.4 (9-77) years. Twenty-seven (15.5%) patients had prosthetic valve endocarditis. The mean duration of follow-up was 7.3±4.2 years (0.1-18.2) adding up to a total of 1030.8 patient/years.Two hundred and eighty-two procedures were performed. The most frequently performed procedure was aortic valve replacement with mechanical prosthesis (81.6%). In-hospital mortality occurred in 27 (15.5%) cases. Postoperatively, 25 (14.4%) patients had low cardiac output and 17 (9.8%) heart block. The actuarial survival rates for 10 and 15 years were 74.6±3.7% and 61.1±10.3%, respectively. In-hospital mortality was found to be associated with female gender, emergency operation, postoperative renal failure and low cardiac output. The long term mortality was significantly associated with mitral valve involvement. Male gender was found to be a significant risk factor for recurrence in the follow-up.Surgery for aortic valve endocarditis has significant mortality. Emergency operation, female gender, postoperative renal failure and low cardiac output are significant risk factors. Risk for recurrence and need for reoperation is low.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896158","annotations":[{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Cardiac output","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_output"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.796656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Artificial heart valve","weight":0.433564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_heart_valve"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.304304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Heart block","weight":0.17755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_block"},{"name":"Aortic valve replacement","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_replacement"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"1030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1030"},{"name":"977","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/977"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Actuarial science","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"}]}
