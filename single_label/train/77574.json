{"id":77574,"title":"[Recent topics of vibration syndrome in Japan--changes of finger systolic blood pressure due to segmental local cooling].","abstract":"Exposure to hand-arm vibration can lead to a complex condition with vascular, sensorineural and musculo skeletal disorders. The vascular disorder has been known as vibration induced white finger (VWF). From the clinical and medico-legal points, objective diagnostic tests for VWF are needed. Measurement of finger systolic blood pressure after finger cooling (FSBP test) is considered to be the most accurate diagnostic laboratory method for an objective confirmation of VWF. In 2005, the FSBP test was standardized internationally. Rosai-hospital group performed a multi-centre study on the FSBP test for diagnosis of VWF and confirmed the diagnostic validity of the FSBP test.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605523","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.62001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.509264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Von Willebrand factor","weight":0.262206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.210525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.179998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Thermoregulation","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Bone disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_disease"},{"name":"Vibration white finger","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration_white_finger"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_law"}]}
