{"id":19859,"title":"Different phenotypes of CD8+ T cells associated with bacterial load in active tuberculosis.","abstract":"Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that affects millions of people worldwide with an annual mortality rate of 1.3 million. The mechanisms contributing to the loss of balance of immune responses and progression to active tuberculosis disease are unknown. Although CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and the cytokines they produce are crucial for protection against tuberculosis they have different roles in tuberculosis immunology. The function of CD4+ T cells has been extensively studied; however, less is known about the phenotype and function of CD8+ T cells. This study evaluated the specific expression of IFN-?, IL-17, IL-10, and TGF-? and ex vivo expression of perforin and granzyme-B by CD8+ T cells from active tuberculosis individuals compared with latent infected individuals and non-latent infected individuals. Tuberculosis responses were correlated with the baciloscopy score. We observed that the presence of IL-10 and TGF-? expression and down-expression of granzyme-B in CD8+ T cells correlated with increased sputum bacillary load in active tuberculosis individuals. These findings provide new insights into the role of CD8+ T cells in Mycobacterium tuberculosis disease.
