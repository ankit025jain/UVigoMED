{"id":42945,"title":"Non- or full-laxative CT colonography vs. endoscopic tests for colorectal cancer screening: a randomised survey comparing public perceptions and intentions to undergo testing.","abstract":"Compare public perceptions and intentions to undergo colorectal cancer screening tests following detailed information regarding CT colonography (CTC; after non-laxative preparation or full-laxative preparation), optical colonoscopy (OC) or flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS).A total of 3,100 invitees approaching screening age (45-54 years) were randomly allocated to receive detailed information on a single test and asked to return a questionnaire. Outcomes included perceptions of preparation and test tolerability, health benefits, sensitivity and specificity, and intention to undergo the test.Six hundred three invitees responded with valid questionnaire data. Non-laxative preparation was rated more positively than enema or full-laxative preparations [effect size (r)?=?0.13 to 0.54; p?<?0.0005 to 0.036]; both forms of CTC and FS were rated more positively than OC in terms of test experience (r?=?0.26 to 0.28; all p-values?<?0.0005). Perceptions of health benefits, sensitivity and specificity (p?=?0.250 to 0.901), and intention to undergo the test (p?=?0.213) did not differ between tests (n?=?144-155 for each test).Despite non-laxative CTC being rated more favourably, this study did not find evidence that offering it would lead to substantially higher uptake than full-laxative CTC or other methods. However, this study was limited by a lower than anticipated response rate.• Improving uptake of colorectal cancer screening tests could improve health benefits • Potential invitees rate CTC and flexible sigmoidoscopy more positively than colonoscopy • Non-laxative bowel preparation is rated better than enema or full-laxative preparations • These positive perceptions alone may not be sufficient to improve uptake • Health benefits and accuracy are rated similarly for preventative screening tests.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24817084","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Sigmoidoscopy","weight":0.710201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoidoscopy"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.705853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.699994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.687646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.643002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.511873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.47511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Enema","weight":0.351026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enema"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.225773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Colon cleansing","weight":0.145927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_cleansing"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.0613743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"901","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/901"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Public university","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university"},{"name":"Invitee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invitee"},{"name":"Ferrovie dello Stato","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrovie_dello_Stato"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential"},{"name":"Tolerability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerability"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
