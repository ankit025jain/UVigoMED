{"id":92492,"title":"Neuromuscular junction disorders mimicking myopathy.","abstract":"Small-amplitude, short-duration motor unit action potentials are non-specific findings seen in myopathies and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorders. NMJ studies (repetitive nerve stimulation and single-fiber electromyography) can determine if such findings are related to NMJ abnormalities but are not considered routinely in atypical cases.Medical records of 338 patients with confirmed NMJ disorders were reviewed to identify cases with a clinical or electrodiagnostic impression of myopathy during initial evaluation. A history of muscle biopsy with findings that did not support a myopathic process was required for inclusion.Four patients met the inclusion criteria. NMJ studies were abnormal in all cases. One patient had elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Three patients were antibody negative: 2 demonstrated immunotherapy responsiveness, and 1 had a Rapsyn mutation.NMJ disorders may mimic myopathies, and NMJ studies should be performed to clarify so-called \"myopathic\" electromyographic findings to avoid unnecessary testing and delayed diagnosis.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862941","annotations":[{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.81272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Neuromuscular junction","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.597067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.509038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.462025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.378818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.297191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Muscle biopsy","weight":0.208754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_biopsy"},{"name":"RAPSN","weight":0.168048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAPSN"},{"name":"Motor unit","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
