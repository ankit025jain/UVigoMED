{"id":38713,"title":"The pressure cooker technique for the treatment of brain AVMs.","abstract":"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) may be cured by injecting liquid embolic agents such as Onyx. Reflux, however, can sometimes be difficult to control and may jeopardize a complete embolization. The pressure cooker technique (PCT) was designed to create an anti-reflux plug by trapping the detachable part of an Onyx-compatible microcatheter with coils and glue in order to obtain wedge-flow conditions, thereby enabling a better understanding of macrofistulous AVMs and a more comprehensive, forceful and controlled Onyx embolization. The PCT might enlarge the range of AVMs amenable to endovascular cure. Three illustrative cases are presented.
