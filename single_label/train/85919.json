{"id":85919,"title":"Role of imaging in diagnosis, staging and follow-up of lung cancer.","abstract":"Primary lung cancer is still the number one cause of cancer death worldwide. Screening, detection and staging of lung cancer are important because the only potentially curative therapy today is surgical resection of early-stage lung cancer.Different imaging techniques can be used in these different processes. Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) technology have allowed investigation of novel methods for the evaluation of lung cancer. Recent advances in magnetic resonance technology and administration of contrast media have further improved the image quality and diagnostic capability of magnetic resonance. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT has been shown to be superior to stand-alone PET or CT in the evaluation of lymph nodes and in the detection of distant metastases.The current recommended imaging required for lung cancer staging is CT of the thorax and PET/CT from skull base to mid-thigh. However, with the recent developments in the armamentarium of imaging techniques, the choice of one of these techniques can be directed by the presence of a technique in a local hospital and/or by the presence of an experienced person at that time.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837705","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Contrast medium","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_medium"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.722756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medical equipment","weight":0.58336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_equipment"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.582717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.569465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.233301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.142562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Nucleobase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"}]}
