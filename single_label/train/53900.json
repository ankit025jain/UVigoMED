{"id":53900,"title":"Expression of stress-induced phosphoprotein1 (STIP1) is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Stress-induced phosphoprotein1 (STIP1) is a candidate biomarker in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In this study, we investigated in detail the expression of STIP1, as well as its functions, in EOC. STIP1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the results were compared with clinicopathologic factors, including survival data. The effects of STIP1 gene silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) were examined in EOC cells and a xenograft model. The expression of STIP1 protein in EOC was significantly higher than in the other study groups (P?<?0.001), and this increase of expression was significantly associated with tumor stage (P?=?0.005), tumor grade (P?=?0.029), and lymph node metastasis (P?=?0.020). In multivariate analysis, overall survival in EOC was significantly shorter in cases with high STIP1 expression (HR?=?2.78 [1.01-7.63], P?=?0.047). STIP1 silencing in EOC cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, in vivo experiments using STIP1 siRNA clearly showed a strong inhibition of tumor growth and a modulation of expression of prosurvival and apoptotic genes, further suggesting that STIP1 silencing can prevent cell proliferation and invasion. In conclusion, increased STIP1 expression is associated with poor survival outcome in EOC, and STIP1 may represent a useful therapeutic target in EOC patients.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488757","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.709756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.580803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.461975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.350122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.201691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Caretaker gene","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_gene"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Hop (protein)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_(protein)"},{"name":"Phosphoprotein","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoprotein"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
