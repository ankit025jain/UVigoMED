{"id":16628,"title":"Imported toxigenic cutaneous diphtheria in a young male returning from Mozambique to Norway, March 2014.","abstract":"Six outbreaks of infectious syphilis in the United Kingdom, ongoing since 2012, have been investigated among men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual men and women aged under 25 years. Interventions included case finding and raising awareness among healthcare professionals and the public. Targeting at-risk populations was complicated as many sexual encounters involved anonymous partners. Outbreaks among MSM were influenced by the use of geospatial real-time networking applications that allow users to locate other MSM within close proximity.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970370","annotations":[{"name":"Syphilis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Men who have sex with men","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men"},{"name":"Heterosexuality","weight":0.800383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Human sexual activity","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.681782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.501239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.440443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.392335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Mozambique","weight":0.38911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Diphtheria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Tornado outbreak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak"},{"name":"Geospatial analysis","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_analysis"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"}]}
