{"id":85374,"title":"Eosinophil-associated lung diseases. A cry for surfactant proteins A and D help?","abstract":"Surfactant proteins (SP)-A and SP-D (SP-A/-D) play important roles in numerous eosinophil-dominated diseases, including asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and allergic rhinitis. In these settings, SP-A/-D have been shown to modulate eosinophil chemotaxis, inhibit eosinophil mediator release, and mediate macrophage clearance of apoptotic eosinophils. Dysregulation of SP-A/-D function in eosinophil-dominated diseases is also not uncommon. Alterations in serum SP-A/-D levels are associated with disease severity in allergic rhinitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, oligimerization of SP-A/-D, necessary for their proper function, can be perturbed by reactive nitrogen species, which are increased in eosinophilic disease. In this review, we highlight the associations of eosinophilic lung diseases with SP-A and SP-D levels and functions.","date":"2014-11-01","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24960334","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Surfactant","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.793981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.581773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.417045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis","weight":0.385962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_bronchopulmonary_aspergillosis"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.276834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Aspergillosis","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillosis"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.155638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Eosinophilic","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0970692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Reactive nitrogen species","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_nitrogen_species"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"}]}
