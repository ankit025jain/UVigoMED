{"id":42801,"title":"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation with concomitant boost radiotherapy associated to capecitabine in rectal cancer patients.","abstract":"The primary end-points were complete pathological response and local control. Secondary end-points were survivals, anal sphincter preservation, and toxicity profile.Patients with T3/T4 and or N+ rectal cancer (n = 65) were treated with preoperative concomitant boost radiotherapy (55 Gy/25 fractions) associated to concurrent chemotherapy with oral capecitabine.All patients completed the programmed treatment. The complete pathological response was achieved by 17 % of the patients. Anal sphincter preservation surgery was possible for 86 % of the patients with low rectal cancer (? 5 cm from the anal verge). The T-stage and N-stage downstaging were achieved by 40 and 58 % of the patients, respectively. Circumferential radial margin was involved (close/positive) in eight patients. After a median follow-up of 26 months, local and distant recurrence occurred in two and 11 patients, respectively. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 86.8 and 81 %, respectively. Non-hematological ? grade 3 toxicities were observed in 15 % of the patients. On univariate analysis N-downstaging and positive circumferential radial margin were significantly associated with worse overall survival (p = 0.003 and p = 0.023, respectively), disease-free survival (p = 0.001 and p = 0.036, respectively), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) (p = 0.001 and p = 0.038, respectively).On multivariate analysis, the N-downstaging were significantly associated with better overall survival (OS) (p = 0.022).Our data support the efficacy of preoperative treatment for rectal cancer in terms of local outcomes. Radiation treatment intensification may have a biological rationale; longer follow-up is needed.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825722","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Capecitabine","weight":0.576026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capecitabine"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.553165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.495717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.387905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.348425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.243394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.147506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"3T","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3T"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"T4 (Channel 4)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T4_(Channel_4)"}]}
