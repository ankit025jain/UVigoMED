{"id":14821,"title":"The Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor SEA0400 limits intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and improves recovery of ventricular function when added to cardioplegia.","abstract":"The Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor SEA0400 prevents myocardial injury in models of global ischemia and reperfusion. We therefore evaluated its potential as a cardioplegia additive.Isolated rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to hypoxia (45 min) followed by reperfusion. During hypoxia, cells were protected using cardioplegia with (n=25) or without (n=24) SEA0400 (1 ?M), or were not protected with cardioplegia (hypoxic control, n=8). Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured using Ca2+ sensitive dye (fura-2 AM). Isolated rat hearts were arrested using cardioplegia with (n=7) or without (n=6) SEA0400 (1 ?M) then reperfused after 45 min of ischemia. Left ventricular (LV) function, troponin release, and mitochondrial morphology were evaluated.Cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia without cardioplegia had poor survival (13%). Survival was significantly improved when cells were protected with cardioplegia containing SEA0400 (68%, p=0.009); cardioplegia without SEA0400 was associated with intermediate survival (42%). Cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia alone had a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ (305 ± 123 nM after 20 minutes of ischemia). Increases in intracellular Ca2+ were reduced in cells arrested with cardioplegia without SEA0400; however cardioplegia containing SEA0400 was associated with the lowest intracellular Ca2+ levels (110 ± 17 vs. 156 ± 42 nM after 45 minutes of ischemia, p=0.004). Hearts arrested with cardioplegia containing SEA0400 had better recovery of LV work compared to cardioplegia without SEA0400 (23140 ± 2264 vs. 7750 ± 929 mmHg.?l, p=0.0001). Troponin release during reperfusion was lower (0.6 ± 0.2 vs. 2.4 ± 0.5 ng/mL, p=0.0026), and there were more intact (41 ± 3 vs. 22 ± 5%, p<0.005), and fewer disrupted mitochondria (24 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 3%, p<0.05) in the SEA0400 group.SEA0400 added to cardioplegia limits accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ during ischemic arrest in isolated cardiomyocytes and prevents myocardial injury and improves recovery of LV function in isolated hearts.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401610","annotations":[{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.777624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.752798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.688541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.596574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dye","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.34538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.283248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.281821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cardioplegia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioplegia"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Latvia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia"},{"name":"Left-wing politics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"305","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/305"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Arrest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest"},{"name":"Heart of Midlothian F.C.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C."},{"name":"Reaction intermediate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_intermediate"},{"name":"AM broadcasting","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
