{"id":61067,"title":"Livin, a novel marker in lymphoma type distinction.","abstract":"Despite advances in immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostics, there are persistent difficulties in differentiating between several subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL). Considering high level of livin expression in hematologic malignancies, we aimed to examine the utility of livin expression ratio, as an ancillary biomarker, in distinguishing CHL from NHL in ambiguous cases. We evaluated livin expression in 38 CHL, 23 NHL, and 39 nonneoplastic lymph nodes in paraffin-embedded blocks. Tissue microarray-based semiquantitative immunoflourecent staining was applied for protein expression. Criterion standard of diagnosis was based on selection of only definite cases and not the cases suspected by hemathopathologists. A significant difference was found in the livin/GAPDH mean ratio (M.R) of expression between NHL and CHL cases. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed 0.6370 to be the best diagnostic cut-off value for the livin/GAPDH expression M.R in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (area under the curve = 0.944); it yielded 92% sensitivity, 94% specificity, likelihood ratios positive 17.5, and likelihood ratios negative 0.07 for diagnosing DLBCL from CHL. Mean ratio of livin/Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression seems to be a valuable index in differentiating DLBCL from CHL. We suggested an optimal cut-off point for livin/GAPDH expression M.R with a high sensitivity and specificity. Thus, in diagnostically difficult cases of DLBCL and CHL, focus on livin as marker may provide useful corroborative information.
