{"id":11578,"title":"The effect of systemic administration of sclerostin antibody in a mouse model of distraction osteogenesis.","abstract":"Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a successful technique for bone lengthening, but one problem is the need to keep an external fixator in place until bone completely regenerates. We hypothesized that the systemic administration of sclerostin antibodies (Scl-Ab) can accelerate bone regeneration in a mouse model of DO. A total of 110 mice were randomized to receive one intravenous injection per week of either Scl-Ab (100 mg per kg body weight) or saline after DO surgery. Mice were sacrificed on day 11, 17, 34 or 51 post-surgery. Microcomputed tomography showed that bone volume per tissue volume of the Scl-Ab treated group was significantly higher on day 11 (P=0.009). Histological examinations indicated that chondrocytes and fibrocartilage predominated in the Scl-Ab group at day 11. The radiographic score of bone healing was also higher in Scl-Ab treated animals at day 11. There was a trend towards higher ultimate force and work to failure in Scl-Ab treated groups on day 34 and 51 (P>0.05). These data suggest the potential utility of Scl-Ab to reduce the time during DO when an external fixator is required.
