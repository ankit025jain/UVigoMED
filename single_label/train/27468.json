{"id":27468,"title":"[Cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis: what is common?].","abstract":"The review analyzes the possible effect of cardiac drugs on the course of osteoporosis (OP). The fact that atherosclerosis and OP share the mechanisms of development, among which the enhanced activity of the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system and endothelial dysfunction are most important, is beyond question now. In this connection, beta-adrenoblockers, nebivolol in particular, attract attention. Nebivolol is known to be a selective beta1-adrenoblocker that has an additional vasodilator property, by stimulating the synthesis of nitric oxide. This may serve to increase bone mineral density and slow down the progression of OP. At the same time, most investigations in this area are retrospective therefore final conclusions call for randomized prospective studies that will be able to evaluate more objectively the effect of cardiac drugs on the prevention of OP or its progression delay.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026813","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.746234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.592859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.1416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Endothelial dysfunction","weight":0.0575759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelial_dysfunction"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Nebivolol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebivolol"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"}]}
