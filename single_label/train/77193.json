{"id":77193,"title":"A role of nesfatin-1/NucB2 in dehydration-induced anorexia.","abstract":"Nesfatin-1/NucB2, an anorexigenic molecule, is expressed mainly in the hypothalamus, particularly in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Nesfatin-1/NucB2 is also expressed in the subfornical organ (SFO). Because the SON and PVN are involved in body fluid regulation, nesfatin-1/NucB2 may be involved in dehydration-induced anorexia. To clarify the effects of endogenous nesfatin-1/NucB2, we studied changes in nesfatin-1/NucB2 mRNA levels in the SFO, SON, and PVN in adult male Wistar rats after exposure to osmotic stimuli by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Significant increases in nesfatin-1/NucB2 mRNA levels, ?2- to 3-fold compared with control, were observed in the SFO, SON, and PVN following water deprivation for 48 h, consumption of 2% NaCl hypertonic saline in drinking water for 5 days, and polyethylene glycol-induced hypovolemia. In addition, nesfatin-1/NucB2 expression was increased in response to water deprivation in a time-dependent manner. These changes in nesfatin-1/NucB2 mRNA expression were positively correlated with plasma sodium concentration, plasma osmolality, and total protein levels in all of the examined nuclei. Immunohistochemistry for nesfatin-1/NucB2 revealed that nesfatin-1/NucB2 protein levels were also increased after 48 h of dehydration and attenuated by 24 h of rehydration. Moreover, intracerebroventricular administration of nesfatin-1/NucB2-neutralizing antibody after 48 h of water deprivation resulted in a significant increase in food intake compared with administration of vehicle alone. These results suggested that nesfatin-1/NucB2 is a crucial peptide in dehydration-induced anorexia.
