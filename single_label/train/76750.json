{"id":76750,"title":"Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency management.","abstract":"In recent years, vitamin D deficiency has been recognized increasingly often in patients, and different supplement regimens have been prescribed to treat it. There has been no consensus on treatment regimens. This study was conducted to determine the management of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in outpatient adults in northeast Tennessee.A retrospective record review was conducted in an internal medicine teaching clinic for patients seen from July 2007-July 2008 in Johnson City, Tennessee. A total of 626 nonelectronic charts listed with vitamin D measurements were used in the analysis. Data regarding the level of vitamin D, whether treatment was prescribed, dose and duration of treatment prescribed, and repeat levels of vitamin D, if any were ordered, were collected. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as levels <20 ng/mL; vitamin D insufficiency was defined as levels ranging from 20 to 29.9 ng/mL.Of the 626 patients, 325 (52%) were vitamin D deficient or insufficient. Of these 325 patients, 184 were given a low-dose supplement and 54 received a high-dose supplement. Eighty-seven were either not prescribed any replacement or the dose was unknown (not documented in the chart). The mean change in serum vitamin D levels was significantly different for the high dose compared with the low dose prescribed. There was no significant sex difference in response to the dose given. On average, those who were vitamin D deficient experienced a greater change than those who were insufficient and a greater change, on average, was observed in those who received a higher dose.Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are highly prevalent. Clinicians tended to prescribe a high dose of treatment for lower levels of serum vitamin D. The response is higher in high-dose treatment. Documentation regarding whether vitamin D supplements were given or the dose of supplements was given and followed up with repeat levels of vitamin D after treatment was poor.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926668","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Internal medicine","weight":0.807902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.638131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.54,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Tennessee","weight":0.517848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.509264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.33322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.320801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0583776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Johnson City, Tennessee","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_City,_Tennessee"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"325","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/325"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Lyndon B.
