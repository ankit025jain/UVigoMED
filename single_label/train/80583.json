{"id":80583,"title":"CD41 is a reliable identification and activation marker for murine basophils in the steady state and during helminth and malarial infections.","abstract":"Basophils, a rare leukocyte population in peripheral circulation, are conventionally identified as CD45(int) CD49b(+) Fc?RI(+) cells. Here, we show that basophils from blood and several organs of na√Øve wild-type mice express CD41, the ? subunit of ?(IIb)?? integrin. CD41 expression on basophils is upregulated after in vivo IL-3 treatment and during infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb). Moreover, CD41 can be used as a reliable marker for basophils, circumventing technical difficulties associated with Fc?RI for basophil identification in a Nb infection model. In vitro anti-IgE cross-linking and IL-3 basophil stimulation showed that CD41 upregulation positively correlates with augmented surface expression of CD200R and increased production of IL-4/IL-13, indicating that CD41 is a basophil activation marker. Furthermore, we found that infection with Plasmodium yoelii 17X (Py17x) induced a profound basophilia and using Mcpt8(DTR) reporter mice as a basophil-specific depletion model, we verified that CD41 can be used as a marker to track basophils in the steady state and during infection. During malarial infection, CD41 expression on basophils is negatively regulated by IFN-? and positively correlates with increased basophil IL-4 production. In conclusion, we provide evidence that CD41 can be used as both an identification and activation marker for basophils during homeostasis and immune challenge.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610714","annotations":[{"name":"Parasitic
