{"id":2848,"title":"Prevalence and pattern of eye disorders among commercial motorcycle riders in Ile-Ife, Osun state.","abstract":"To describe the prevalence and pattern of eye disorders existing among commercial motorcycle riders (CMRs) in Ile-Ife, Osun State. Materials, Subjects and Methods: A total of 1626 registered CMRs operated in 40 registered motorcycle assembly units in Ile-Ife. Using a multi- staged random sampling technique, a total of 322 riders were randomly selected from 10 units. Equal number of 322 was selected from the sample space as control. Structured questionnaires were administered and ocular examination carried out.SA total of 312 (96.9%) CMRs had normal vision (better than 6/18) in the better eye. The observed prevalence of subnormal visual acuity (<6/18-3/60) was 3.1% (10 CMRs) while prevalence of monocular vision was 2.8% (9 riders). Cataract and glaucoma were the major causes of visual impairment and blindness. The common ocular conditions seen were presbyopia (11.8%), allergic conjunctivitis (11.5%), glaucoma suspect (8.1%), pterygium (4.7%), pingueculum (4.0%), uncorrected refractive error (3.7%) and cataract (2.8%). It was also observed that the longer the years of riding experience of these riders, the higher the occurrence of pterygium with a significant statistical impact of p value of 0.009. Presbyopia was also the commonest disorder amongst the control group (11.2%).Presbyopia was the most common finding from the study while the commonest anterior segment disorder was pterygium which was an occupation- related ocular disorder. Causes of blindness seen were avoidable.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25331244","annotations":[{"name":"Presbyopia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyopia"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Conjunctivitis","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Allergic conjunctivitis","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.833809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.751881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.589989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Pterygium (conjunctiva)","weight":0.518729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygium_(conjunctiva)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.441668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.329404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.316544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.228847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"Monocular","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocular"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"},{"name":"Monocular vision","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocular_vision"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Motorcycle","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle"}]}
