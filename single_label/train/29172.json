{"id":29172,"title":"Cardioprotective role of leaves extracts of Carissa opaca against CCl4 induced toxicity in rats.","abstract":"Carissa opaca are used traditionally in Pakistan for the treatment of various human ailments. Therefore, the study is arranged out to assess the cardio protective potential of different fractions of Carissa opaca leaves on CCl4-induced oxidative trauma in kidney.The parameters studied in this respect were the cardiac function test (CK (U/l), CKMB (U/l), genotoxicity (% DNA fragmentation), characteristic morphological findings and antioxidant enzymatic level of cardiac tissue homogenate.The protective effects of various fractions of Carissa opaca (C. opaca) leaves extract against CCl4 administration was reviewed by rat cardiac functions alterations. Chronic toxicity caused by eight week treatment of CCl4 to the rats significantly changed the cardiac function test, decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione contents whereas significant increase was found in lipid peroxidation comparative to control group. Administration of various fractions of C. opaca leaves extract with CCl4 showed protective ability against CCl4 intoxication by restoring the cardiac functions alterations, activities of antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation in rat. CCl4 induction in rats also caused DNA fragmentation and histopathalogical abnormalities which were restored by co-admistration of various fraction of C. opaca leaves extract.Results revealed that various fraction of C. opaca are helpful in cardiac dysfunctions.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716654","annotations":[{"name":"Genotoxicity","weight":0.851267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotoxicity"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.615555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.569809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.558832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.435994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic toxicity","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_toxicity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Human heart","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_heart"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Homogenization (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(biology)"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
