{"id":86860,"title":"Treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a systematic review.","abstract":"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neurocutaneous malignancy that frequently arises in sun-exposed areas of the head and neck. Standard therapy focuses on wide local excision (WLE) with adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy. However, treatment is often complicated by concerns for cosmesis and for preservation of the head and neck neurovasculature.To explore treatment-related outcomes of the head and neck MCC.A MEDLINE and Google Scholar search was performed for studies focusing on the head and neck MCC treatment.The search terms produced 100 articles. Seventeen studies met eligibility/screening criteria, yielding 868 patients. Three of the 6 relevant studies found a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between surgery and surgery plus adjuvant radiation. Two studies found no difference in DFS or overall survival (OS) in patients receiving chemotherapy. Two studies found no difference in DFS between radiotherapy and surgery with adjuvant radiation. No difference in OS was found between WLE and Mohs surgery.In an uncomplicated head and neck MCC, treatment with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy is effective in increasing survival and reducing recurrence. Radiotherapy alone may be appropriate for inoperable regions. Primary chemotherapy seems to have a limited role; however, few studies explored this treatment modality.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25350122","annotations":[{"name":"Merkel cell carcinoma","weight":0.910859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkel_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Mohs surgery","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_surgery"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Wide local excision","weight":0.681947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_local_excision"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.585409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.574945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Marylebone Cricket Club","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marylebone_Cricket_Club"},{"name":"Google Scholar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar"},{"name":"Cosmesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmesis"},{"name":"Merkel cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkel_cell"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Hebrew language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"},{"name":"Mohs scale of mineral hardness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness"},{"name":"868","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Search engine technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_technology"},{"name":"Scholar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"}]}
