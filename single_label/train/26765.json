{"id":26765,"title":"Root remodeling and aortic valve repair for unicuspid aortic valve.","abstract":"Unicuspid aortic valve (UAV) anatomy is occasionally encountered in adolescents or young adults and not infrequently associated with aneurysm of the ascending aorta and aortic root. To manage both defects without aortic valve replacement we propose a combination of remodeling of the aortic root combined with bicuspidization of the UAV.Between 1 December 2007 and November 2013, 25 patients (23 males; mean age, 38 ± 12 years; range, 21 to 65 years) with aortic regurgitation as a result of UAV and aortic root dilatation underwent remodeling of the aortic root and bicuspidization of the UAV. The dilated aortic root tissue was resected, leaving the wall adjacent to the normal commissure and at 180 degrees orientation and similar height for the new commissure. The graft was configured to create two symmetric tongues of graft and sutured to the remnants of the aortic root wall. The dysplastic right coronary cusp was resected, and autologous pericardial patches augmented the deficiency of cusp tissue between the left and noncoronary cusps. A suture annuloplasty was used in 20 cases. All patients were followed clinically and echocardiographically at 3, 6, and 12 months and at yearly intervals. Cumulative follow-up was 677 months (mean, 27 ± 18 months).No early or late death occurred. Intraoperative echocardiography revealed minimal or no aortic regurgitation in all patients; at discharge, systolic mean gradient was 6 ± 3 mm Hg. There was no bleeding or thromboembolic event during the follow-up. One patient exhibited endocarditis and underwent reoperation. Two patients experienced relevant recurrent aortic regurgitation for limited suture dehiscence between the patch and the cusp and were reoperated on between 16 and 32 months postoperatively. One patient underwent biologic valve replacement, and two valves were re-repaired. At 5 years, freedom from reoperation and aortic valve replacement was 81% and 91%, respectively.In the presence of UAV and aortic root dilatation, the concept of valve bicuspidization and root remodeling can be applied with satisfactory hemodynamic results. The hemodynamic function of an aortic valve preserved by this concept is good. If sufficient stability can be achieved, aortic valve replacement can be avoided in young patients with aortic regurgitation caused by UAV and root aneurysm.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25085562","annotations":[{"name":"Aortic insufficiency","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_insufficiency"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.847682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.672147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.610151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.575058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.528546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.433165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Aortic valve replacement","weight":0.241472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_replacement"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.204334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.177041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Heart valve repair","weight":0.0267806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve_repair"},{"name":"Regurgitation (circulation)","weight":0.0265917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(circulation)"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"}]}
