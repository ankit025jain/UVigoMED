{"id":46862,"title":"MicroRNA-143 suppresses gastric cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis by targeting COX-2.","abstract":"To investigate the function of microRNA-143 (miR-143) in gastric cancer and explore the target genes of miR-143.A quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed to evaluate miR-143 expression in gastric cancer cell lines. After transfecting gastric cancer cells with miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p precursors, Alamar blue and apoptosis assays were used to measure the respective proliferation and apoptosis rates. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assays after miR-143 transfection. Reporter plasmids were constructed, and a luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the miR-143 binding site on COX-2.Both miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p were significantly downregulated in multiple gastric cancer cell lines. Forced miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p expression in gastric cancer cells produced a profound cytotoxic effect. MiR-145-5p transfection into gastric cancer cells resulted in a greater growth inhibitory effect (61.23% ± 3.16% vs. 46.58% ± 4.28%, P < 0.05 in the MKN-1 cell line) and a higher apoptosis rate (28.74% ± 1.93% vs. 22.13% ± 3.31%, P < 0.05 in the MKN-1 cell line) than miR-143-3p transfection. Further analysis indicated that COX-2 expression was potently suppressed by miR-143-5p but not by miR-143-3p. The activity of a luciferase reporter construct that contained the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of COX-2 was downregulated by miR-143-5p (43.6% ± 4.86%, P < 0.01) but not by miR-143-3p. A mutation in the miR-145-5p binding site completely ablated the regulatory effect on luciferase activity, which suggests that there is a direct miR-145-5p binding site in the 3'-UTR of COX-2.Both miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p function as anti-oncomirs in gastric cancer. However, miR-143-5p alone directly targets COX-2, and it exhibits a stronger tumor suppressive effect than miR-143-3p.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616567","annotations":[{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.862549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.718164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.608904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.484048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.439153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.404389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.382247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.366407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.351051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Five prime untranslated region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_prime_untranslated_region"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
