{"id":54183,"title":"Testosterone and type 2 diabetes in men.","abstract":"To assess from observational data if low testosterone in men is an independent risk factor for high fasting glucose (FG) and for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D).Multivariate analysis of data from 991 male US Air Force veterans who completed six medical examinations over 20 years.Low testosterone was moderately related to high FG, independent of age and obesity. Low testosterone is a very weak predictor of a diagnosis of T2D.In men, low testosterone is an independent risk factor for high FG, comparable to aging and obesity. Low testosterone is a weak predictor of a diagnosis of T2D.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471529","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.710287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.5365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.430148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.384709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"United States Air Force","weight":0.38185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.29466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.274248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.254608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.044683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Veteran","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/991"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"US Airways","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Douglas T2D","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_T2D"}]}
