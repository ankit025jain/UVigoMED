{"id":68301,"title":"Surgical outcomes in the management of isolated nodal recurrences: a multicenter, international retrospective cohort.","abstract":"We report a multicenter international cohort representing what is to our knowledge the largest surgical experience with managing isolated retroperitoneal nodal recurrence of renal cell carcinoma, a unique subset of locoregional disease, yet to be described in detail.Patients with isolated nodal recurrence of pTanyN+M0 disease after nephrectomy were identified by retrospective chart review at 3 independent institutions. Progression-free survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and used to compare survival outcomes between primary T(1-2)N(any)M0 and T3N(any)M0 tumors as well as clear cell and nonclear cell histology renal cell carcinoma.A total of 22 patients met study inclusion criteria. Median time to local postoperative recurrence was 31.5 months (IQR 12.9-43.3). After resection of isolated nodal recurrence 10 patients (46%) had a secondary recurrence at a median of 11.2 months (IQR 8.1-18.4), of whom 2 (9%) died of the disease. Overall median progression-free survival was 12.7 months, including 24.8 months for T(1-2)N(any)M0 tumors, 9.9 months for T3N(any)M0 tumors, and 13.4 and 17.6 months for clear and nonclear cell renal cell carcinoma, respectively.Surgical resection represents the best curative option for patients who present with isolated retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence of renal cell carcinoma. Durable postoperative progression-free survival is attainable in many patients regardless of histology or clinical TNM stage. In addition, our cohort showed a lower renal cell carcinoma related mortality rate than in previous series of local metastasis. As such, all patients free of precluding comorbidities should be considered candidates for complete surgical resection performed by an experienced genitourinary surgeon.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530987","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.789674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.481252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.437146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.431916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.319491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.256946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0615741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"}]}
