{"id":53470,"title":"miR-335 represents an independent prognostic marker in epithelial ovarian cancer.","abstract":"To investigate the clinical significance of miR-335 expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).Expression of miR-335 in normal ovaries, EOC, and omental metastases was determined by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were examined using KaplanMeier curves and the Cox proportional hazards regression model.miR-335 expression level was reduced in malignant tissue samples, especially in omental metastases. Low miR-335 levels in EOC were associated with shorter OS (P < .001) and RFS (P = .002). In the multivariate analyses, low miR-335 levels emerged as an independent prognostic factor for poor OS (P = .005) and RFS (P = .016). miR-335 was downregulated in the recurrence group compared with the nonrecurrence group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.818 (95% confidence interval, 0.675-0.961).Our results indicate that miR-335 relates to the prognosis of patients with EOC and is a promising predictor of EOC recurrence.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Endocrine System
