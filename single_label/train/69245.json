{"id":69245,"title":"Long-term graft outcome after renal arterial reconstruction during living related kidney transplantation.","abstract":"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the repair of vascular variations/pathologies in living donor kidney transplantations in a single centre over a 15-year period.Between 01/1997 and 05/2012, 338 living donor renal transplantations were performed in the Department for Endovascular and Vascular Surgery, University of Düsseldorf, Germany. Twenty-four of them showed disorders, like multiple renal arteries (MRA), atherosclerotic stenosis or fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) needing vascular repair before transplantation.Mean age of donors was 51 ± 11.2, in recipient's 44 ± 13.9 years. In seven transplantations, renal artery (RA) repair was performed because of MRA. Atherosclerotic stenosis of the RA was apparent in 12 cases needing a repair with disobliteration. FMD was the reason in five transplantations for vascular repair. Complications like renal vessel thrombosis, lymphocele, heamorrhage, distal urinary leakage and ureteral obstruction was not significantly associated with RA reconstruction. Comparison of renal function in kidneys with reconstructed RA compared with kidneys without vascular repair showed no significant difference in primary function and serum creatinine up to the first year after transplantation. Mean follow-up was 75.6 ± 48.1 months. The 5-year graft survival rate for kidneys with RA repair was 88.5 vs. 93.4 % without reconstruction.We could show that RA pathologies, suitable repaired, are not a contraindication for transplantation with acceptable 5-year-graft-survival rates.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24458549","annotations":[{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Vascular surgery","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_surgery"},{"name":"Fibromuscular dysplasia","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromuscular_dysplasia"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.758055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.734757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.704215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.670269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.524967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.522993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.515006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.167811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0583839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance angiography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_angiography"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"}]}
