{"id":72839,"title":"[Nectins and nectin-like receptors DNAM-1 and CRTAM: new ways for tumor escape].","abstract":"Nectin and nectin-like (Necl) are cell adhesion molecules expressed in various tumors. They were alternatively reported as involved in tumor suppressor or oncogenic functions that led to their use as histological or serological cancer markers. Gene inactivation in lung carcinoma but overexpression in leukemia were reported for Necl-2. DNAM-1 and CRTAM are emerging NK receptors of immune cells that were described to interact with nectin and Necl. DNAM-1, constitutively expressed by CD8(+) T cells, NK or ?? T lymphocytes, is a ligand of Necl-5. It participates to tumor immunosurveillance promoting Necl-5 expressing tumor cell lysis. CRTAM, only expressed after lymphocyte activation, is a ligand of Necl-2. Engagement of CRTAM with Necl-2 has opposite effects depending on the type of lymphocyte. For NK or CD8(+) T cells, it promotes cytotoxicity and IFN? secretion favoring immunosurveillance. By contrast, CRTAM/Necl-2 interaction triggers cell death of activated TVg9Vd2 ?? T cells favoring immune escape. Nectin and Necl-mediated interactions appear to be crucial for the delicate balance between tumor escape and antitumor response.
