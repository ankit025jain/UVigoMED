{"id":25739,"title":"[Cardioprotective capabilities of drug meldonium in secondary prevention after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with documented myocardial ischemia].","abstract":"The purpose of research — analysis of capabilities in cytoprotective drug m?ldonium, in complex in the cardioprotective effect of secondary prevention after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with stable coronary heart disease (n=35 ) aged ?65 years with incomplete revascularization at 6 months after PCI and positive exercise test (SFI) were randomized 1:1 to groups controlled physical training (CPT) with intensity 80% and a duration of 2 weeks (10 SFI): group 1 (n=17; 53,9±6,2 years) and group 2 (n=18; 56,1±4,8 years). Patients in Group 1, in addition to SFI m?ldonium administered at a dose of 1000 mg/ml intravenously. In the 1st group on the background m?ldonium adjunctive therapy showed a significant increase in the duration from 15±2 to 32±7 min for the 10th CPT (p<0.05). Index of maximum oxygen consumption after 10 intense CPT increased to 20.8±1.06 ml/kg/min compared to baseline (18.6±1.1 ml/kg/min, p<0.05) and the control group (18.5±1.5 ml/kg/min, p<0.05). Use of meldonium was also associated with decrease of maximum ST-segment depression (from -0.18±0.1 to 0.10±0.2 mV), increases of exercise duration (from 364±22 to 556±29 s) threshold heart rate (from 118±12 to 132±5 bpm), decrease of time of ST segment recovery to baseline (from 385±32 to 242±22 s, p<0.05). Final level of free fatty acids in the meldonium group was significantly lower than that in the control group (0.248±0.047 vs. 0.265±0.031 mg/dl). Inclusion of meldonium in complex treatment after PCI potentiates cardioprotective effect of intensive CPT as evidenced by the positive dynamics of ECG and biochemical markers of myocardial ischemia.","date":"2014-09-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177815","annotations":[{"name":"Percutaneous coronary
