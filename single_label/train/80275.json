{"id":80275,"title":"Detection of Echinococcus multilocularis in faeces by nested PCR with the use of diluted DNA samples.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to choose the optimal variant of PCR examination of faeces to detect Echinococcus multilocularis infection which would allow to reduce the influence of different inhibitors in faeces. The investigation was carried out by comparison of 3 different methods of DNA isolation from faeces and different DNA dilutions used in PCR. Thirty five intestines of red foxes were used. Small intestines were examined by the sedimentation and counting technique (SCT). Faeces were collected from the rectum for PCR and flotation. DNA were isolated with the use of 3 different methods. Two methods were dedicated for faeces: method 1 (M1)--for larger samples and method 2 (M2) - for standard samples. The third method, method 3 (M3), was not dedicated for faeces. DNA samples were tested by nested PCR in 6 variants: not diluted (1/1) and 5 diluted (1/2.5, 1/5, 1/10. 1/20, 1/40). E. multilocularis was found by SCT in 18 from 35 (51.4%) intestines. Taenia-type eggs were detected only in 20.0% of faecal samples. In PCR the highest number of positive results (45.7%) were obtained during examination of DNA isolated by M1 method, and then 40.0% and 34.3%, respectively, for M2 and M3. In some samples positive results in PCR were obtained only in diluted DNA. For example, 8 from 12 positive samples isolated by M3 method gave the PCR negative results in non-diluted DNA and positive only after dilution 1:2.5, 1:10 or 1:20. Also 3 samples isolated by methods dedicated for stool gave positive results only after DNA dilution. The investigation has revealed that in copro-PCR for detection of E. multilocularis infection additional using of diluted DNA (besides non diluted) can avoid false negative results causing by PCR inhibition. In the best method of DNA isolation (M1), the use of non diluted DNA sample together with diluted in proportion 1:10 seems to be optimal.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724473","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.818674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.696909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.583205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.467585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.307319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA profiling","weight":0.30613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling"},{"name":"Echinococcus multilocularis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_multilocularis"},{"name":"Red Fox","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Fox"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Echinococcus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fox","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting"},{"name":"Dilution gene","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_gene"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Buoyancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"M1 motorway","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_motorway"}]}
