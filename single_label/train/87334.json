{"id":87334,"title":"Treatment of intracranial foreign body.","abstract":"Craniospinal penetrating foreign body (FB) injuries are interesting, but rarely observed, cases. They are important in terms of the complications that they may cause. The etiologies of craniospinal penetrating injuries and intracranial FB are also different. Though a sewing needle is more rarely seen in an intracranial FB, it may occur as atttempted infanticide or as a result of an accident especially in early childhood before the closure of fontanels. We detected an intracranial sewing needle in the head radiograph of a case admitted to the emergency department for another reason. We present this case since this is a rare injury and the etiologies of craniospinal penetrating foreign body have different characteristics.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255596","annotations":[{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.815354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.701299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.489419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.447438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Penetrating trauma","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrating_trauma"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Infanticide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Fontanelle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle"},{"name":"Sewing needle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewing_needle"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Early childhood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood"},{"name":"Fullback (gridiron football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)"},{"name":"Sewing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewing"}]}
