{"id":69418,"title":"VHL and HIF-1?: gene variations and prognosis in early-stage clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Von Hipple-Lindau gene (VHL) inactivation represents the most frequent abnormality in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?) expression is regulated by O2 level. In normal O2 conditions, VHL binds HIF-1? and allows HIF-1? proteasomal degradation. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been found located in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain at codon 582 (C1772T, rs11549465, Pro582Ser). In hypoxia, VHL/HIF-1? interaction is abolished and HIF-1? activates target genes in the nucleus. This study analyzes the impact of genetic alterations and protein expression of VHL and the C1772T SNP of HIF-1? gene (HIF-1?) on prognosis in early-stage ccRCC (pT1a, pT1b, and pT2). Mutational analysis of the entire VHL sequence and the genotyping of HIF-1? C1772T SNP were performed together with VHL promoter methylation analysis and loss of heterozygosis (LOH) analysis at (3p25) locus. Data obtained were correlated with VHL and HIF-1? protein expression and with tumor-specific survival (TSS). VHL mutations, methylation status, and LOH were detected in 51, 11, and 12% of cases, respectively. Our results support the association between biallelic alterations and/or VHL silencing with a worse TSS. Moreover, we found a significant association between the HIF-1? C1772C genotype and a worse TSS. The same association was found when testing the presence of HIF-1? protein in the nucleus. Our results highlight the role of VHL/HIF-1? pathway in RCC and support the molecular heterogeneity of early-stage ccRCC. More important, we show the involvement of HIF-1? C1772T SNP in ccRCC progression.","date":"2014-01-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446253","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell
