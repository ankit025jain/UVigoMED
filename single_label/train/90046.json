{"id":90046,"title":"Patterns of accidental genital trauma and factors associated with surgical management in girls visiting the emergency department of a referral center.","abstract":"To examine our experience with the management of accidental genital trauma (AGT) and to identify variables associated with surgical management or admission in girls aged ?15 y.A retrospective, observational study.Tertiary referral hospital.Girls with AGT visiting the emergency department (ED) between 2003 andÂ 2011.None.Admission rate and surgery rate.AGT was the cause in 159 out of 327 girls (49%) who visited the Gynecologic Division of ED; and in girls aged ?10 years, AGT accounted for 78% of the visits (145/187). Twenty girls (13%) were admitted to the hospital and 38 girls (24%) underwent surgical management. Girls who visited the ED during daytime and those with laceration-type or large lesions tended to receive surgical management. Girls with large lesions also tended to be admitted to the hospital.AGT is the major gynecologic cause of ED visits in girls. Time of visit, type and size of lesion were associated with surgical management. Lesion size was also a determinant for admission in girls with AGT. Gynecologists must be familiar with the evaluation and management of girls with AGT.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656698","annotations":[{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.744301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.283953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.240845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"}]}
