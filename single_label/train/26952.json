{"id":26952,"title":"[Role of bone marrow-derived CD133+ stem cells in cardiac regeneration: from experimental to clinical trials].","abstract":"Recent advances in coronary revascularization techniques have improved the outcomes of ischemic heart disease in both acute and chronic settings. As a drawback, an increase in patients with an advanced stage of ischemic cardiomyopathy refractory to optimal medical treatment has been observed. Among the therapeutic alternatives under investigation, cell therapy showed considerable anti-ischemic potential. Although several types of cells have been used, bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells are among the most appealing therapeutic agents due to their angiogenic properties. In particular, endothelial progenitors expressing the transmembrane protein CD133 have been in vitro and in vivo extensively characterized and clinically tested. The aim of this paper is to discuss the translational process that allowed the clinical application of CD133+ endothelial progenitor cells in the context of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
