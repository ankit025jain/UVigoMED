{"id":83423,"title":"Reversible ketomethylene-based inhibitors of human neutrophil proteinase 3.","abstract":"Neutrophil serine proteases, proteinase 3 (PR3) and human neutrophil elastase (HNE), are considered as targets for chronic inflammatory diseases. Despite sharing high sequence similarity, the two enzymes have different substrate specificities and functions. While a plethora of HNE inhibitors exist, PR3 specific inhibitors are still in their infancy. We have designed ketomethylene-based inhibitors for PR3 that show low micromolar IC50 values. Their synthesis was made possible by amending a previously reported synthesis of ketomethylene dipeptide isosteres to allow for the preparation of derivatives suitable for solid phase peptide synthesis. The best inhibitor (Abz-VADnV[?](COCH2)ADYQ-EDDnp) was found to be selective for PR3 over HNE and to display a competitive and reversible inhibition mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the interactions between enzyme and ketomethylene-containing inhibitors are similar to those with the corresponding substrates. We also confirm that N- and C-terminal FRET groups are important for securing high inhibitory potency toward PR3.
