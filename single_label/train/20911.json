{"id":20911,"title":"Serum interleukin-6 levels in murine models of Candida albicans infection.","abstract":"Two Balb/C mouse models of Candida infection were used to detect serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) responses. The first model used systemic infection by Candida albicans ATCC 10231 strain infected through the lateral tail vein of mice without any specific pretreatment. The median Candida burdens of the kidneys were 1.5 × 106 CFU/ml 24 h postinoculation (p.i.) and 1.2 × 107 CFU/ml 72 h p.i., while median serum IL-6 levels were 479.3 pg/ml and 934.5 pg/ml, respectively. The Candida burden showed significant correlation with serum IL-6 24 h p.i. (R2 = 0.6358; P = 0.0082) but not 72 h p.i.The second model was a mouse vaginitis model applying intravaginal inoculation of mice pretreated with subcutaneous estradiol-valerate (10 mg/ml) 3 days before infection. Candida cell count in vaginal lavage fluid was 2.8 × 106 CFU/ml 24 h p.i. and 1.4 × 108 CFU/ml 72 h p.i. Serum IL-6 response was detected in 4 of 15 mice 24 h p.i. and 9 of 15 mice 72 h p.i. Even the responders had low IL-6 serum levels (mean values 29.9 pg/ml and 60.1 pg/ml, respectively) not correlating with Candida cell count in vaginal lavage fluid.In conclusion, serum IL-6 had strong relationship with systemic C. albicans infection while the local C. albicans infection of the vagina led to partial, prolonged and limited serum IL-6 response.
