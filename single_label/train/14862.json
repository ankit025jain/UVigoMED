{"id":14862,"title":"Antioxidant potential of melatonin enhances the response to L-dopa in 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-parkinsonian mice.","abstract":"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain pathogenesis characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta, and can be modeled by the neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The current research was directed to investigate the role of melatonin in preventing the gradual decrease in the response to L-dopa in MPTP-induced parkinsonism in mice.Eighty four male Swiss mice were divided into seven groups. Group I is the saline group. The other six groups were injected with MPTP (20 mg/kg/2 h). Group II is the MPTP control group. Group III was treated with L-dopa/carbidopa (100/10 mg/kg, po). Group IV and V were treated with melatonin (5 or 10 mg/kg, po), respectively. Group VI and VII received L-dopa/carbidopa in combination with melatonin in the same above-mentioned doses, respectively.Results showed that MPTP-treated mice exhibited low striatal dopamine level accompanied by motor impairment and increased oxidative stress. Treatment with L-dopa improved the motor performance of mice. Addition of melatonin to L-dopa therapy improved the motor response to L-dopa and increased striatal dopamine level. This combination reduced lipid peroxidation, ameliorated reduced glutathione and improved antioxidant enzyme activities (p ? 0.05).Overall, our study suggests that the antioxidant potential of melatonin makes it a promising candidate to L-dopa in treating Parkinson's disease.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399717","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.890526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Melatonin","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin"},{"name":"Substantia nigra","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantia_nigra"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Parkinsonism","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonism"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Dopaminergic","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.76088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.680803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"MPTP","weight":0.667039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPTP"},{"name":"Pars compacta","weight":0.648712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_compacta"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.621664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Phenyl group","weight":0.579191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenyl_group"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.571019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.558325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.401498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.223323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.202638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.181638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.0644769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
