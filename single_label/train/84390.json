{"id":84390,"title":"[Correction of minor breast ptosis by subfascia breast augmentation with periareolar incision and anatomic mammary implant].","abstract":"To correct the minor breast ptosis with minimal breast scar.32 cases with minor breast ptosis were corrected by subfascia breast augmentation with periareolar incision and anatomic mammary implant.Breast ptosis was completely or mostly corrected in all the patitents with periareola scar, avoiding the vertical breast scar. Except for short-time effusion in 2 cases, no other complication happened.Subfascia breast augmentation with periareolar incision and anatomic mammary implant can effectively correct minor breast ptosis with minimal breast scar and less complication.","date":"2014-08-12","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112007","annotations":[{"name":"Ptosis (breasts)","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptosis_(breasts)"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Areola","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areola"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Mammary gland","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.449525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Ptosis (eyelid)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptosis_(eyelid)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
