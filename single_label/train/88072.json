{"id":88072,"title":"[Total arch replacement for ruptured Stanford type B aortic dissection with thrombosed pseudolumen presenting hemodynamic deterioration].","abstract":"We report 2 cases of ruptured type B aortic dissection with thrombosed pseudolumen presenting hemodynamic deterioration which is a life-threatening condition. In such cases, surgical treatment often resulted in high mortality rates. We underwent total arch replacement via median sternotomy. In both cases, postoperative courses were uneventful. This approach ensured us wider operative field to establish cardiopulmonary bypass quickly, and to perform distal anastomosis without much difficulty.
