{"id":88785,"title":"Quantitative computer tomography in children and adolescents: the 2013 ISCD Pediatric Official Positions.","abstract":"In 2007, International Society of Clinical Densitometry Pediatric Positions Task Forces reviewed the evidence for the clinical application of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) in children and adolescents. At that time, numerous limitations regarding the clinical application of pQCT were identified, although its use as a research modality for investigation of bone strength was highlighted. The present report provides an updated review of evidence for the clinical application of pQCT, as well as additional reviews of whole body QCT scans of the central and peripheral skeletons, and high-resolution pQCT in children. Although these techniques remain in the domain of research, this report summarizes the recent literature and evidence of the clinical applicability and offers general recommendations regarding the use of these modalities in pediatric bone health assessment.
