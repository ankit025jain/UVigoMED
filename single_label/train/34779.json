{"id":34779,"title":"Using high-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplements to lower triglyceride levels in 10- to 19-year-olds.","abstract":"Omega-3 fatty acids supplements lower triglyceride (TG) levels in adults; little pediatric information is available. We evaluated their effect in hypertriglyceridemic adolescents.Twenty-five patients aged 10 to 19 years with TG levels 150 to 1000 mg/dL were randomized to 6 months double-blind trial of Lovaza (~3360 mg docosahexaenoic acid + eicosapentaenoic acid per day) versus placebo.Baseline mean TG levels were 227 mg/dL (standard deviation = 49). TG levels declined at 3 months in the Lovaza group by 54 ± 27 mg/dL (mean ± standard error; P = .02) and by 34 ± 26 mg/dL (P = .16) in the placebo group. The difference in TG lowering between groups was not significant (P = .52). There were no between-group differences in endothelial function, blood pressure, body mass index, C-reactive protein, or side effects.High-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplements are well tolerated in adolescents. However, declines in TG levels did not differ significantly from Placebo in this small study.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707021","annotations":[{"name":"Docosahexaenoic acid","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.887764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.862063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Eicosapentaenoic acid","weight":0.669715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.581145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.450522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Placebo-controlled study","weight":0.376921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.224556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.179634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Standard error (statistics)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error_(statistics)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Omega","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"227 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/227_(TV_series)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
