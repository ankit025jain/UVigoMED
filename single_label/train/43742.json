{"id":43742,"title":"[Case of small bowel angioectasia in which the resection site was angiographically detected using intraoperative dye infusion].","abstract":"A 37-year-old Japanese man undergoing treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy was presented with weakness and melena. He had conjunctival pallor and difficulty in standing;his blood pressure was 81/62 mmHg. Abdominal computed tomography revealed contrast dye leakage into the small intestine. He was diagnosed with hemorrhagic shock secondary to intestinal bleeding;we administered large volumes of intravenous fluid along with performing a blood transfusion. We then performed angiography to determine the site of bleeding angioectasia and placed a catheter into the affected artery. We identified the resection site using an intraoperative dye infusion via the catheter, and successfully performed small bowel resection. He was subsequently discharged without complications.
