{"id":88062,"title":"Dislocated dental bridge covering the larynx: usefulness of tracheal tube guides under video-assisted laryngoscopy for induction of general anesthesia, thus avoiding tracheostomy.","abstract":"To describe a case with dislodgement of dental bridge with clasps covering the vocal cords, in a patient who was successfully intubated using tube exchanger under video-assisted laryngoscopy.Clinical case record with a video clip.University hospital.A 83-year-old woman presented with dislodgement of her dental bridge whilst eating. Laryngoscopy revealed a foreign body almost entirely covering the vocal cords, with the clasps of the dislodged partial denture piercing the pharyngeal wall. Before induction of general anesthesia, a tracheal tube introducer combined with video-assisted laryngoscopy was introduced into the trachea in the awake condition, followed by successful endotracheal intubation. Thereafter, the dislodged denture was extracted via the oral cavity.Tracheal tube introducers combined with video-assisted laryngoscopy appear to be useful for airway management, decreasing the number of avoidable tracheostomies performed.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919781","annotations":[{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Tracheotomy","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.790158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Airway management","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway_management"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.530194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.324421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Body piercing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_piercing"}]}
