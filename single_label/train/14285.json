{"id":14285,"title":"Frequency of intestinal parasites in pet dogs from an urban area (Greater Oporto, northern Portugal).","abstract":"The present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in dogs with no clinical signs (n=175; group H) and in dogs with gastrointestinal disease (n=193; group D) that were admitted to a veterinary hospital. In group H, the overall prevalence of intestinal parasites (i.e. the presence of at least one species) was 20.6%. Cystoisospora canis was the most prevalent protozoon (8.0%) followed by Giardia spp. (7.4%); Toxocara canis (5.1%) was the most frequent helminth, followed by Trichuris vulpis (1.1%) and Toxascaris leonina (0.6%). Among group H, age ? 6 months was found to be a risk factor for infection with C. canis and with at least one agent (odds ratio [OR]=3.4). In group D parasites were found in 33.7% of the dogs, with Giardia spp. (15.5%) being the most prevalent species, followed by C. canis (13.5%), T. canis (7.8%), T. vulpis (2.6%) and T. leonina (0.5%). In group D dogs, age ? 6 months was a risk factor for infection with Giardia spp. (OR=3.2), with C. canis (OR=32.7) and with at least one agent (OR=7.2). This study reveals a remarkable number of dogs infected but with no clinical signs.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433853","annotations":[{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.932147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Protozoa","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.762391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.587328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.528555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"Pet","weight":0.517041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.487855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Giardia","weight":0.450458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giardia"},{"name":"Intestinal parasite","weight":0.423569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_parasite"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.337999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Dog flea","weight":0.314973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_flea"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Toxocaridae","weight":0.219609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxocaridae"},{"name":"Toxocara canis","weight":0.216559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxocara_canis"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.211611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0895501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Porto","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto"},{"name":"Toxascaris leonina","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxascaris_leonina"},{"name":"Digestive disease","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_disease"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Trichuris","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Canis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis"}]}
