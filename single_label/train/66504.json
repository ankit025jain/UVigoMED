{"id":66504,"title":"In vitro evaluation of LithAssist: a novel combined holmium laser and suction device.","abstract":"The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate and compare a novel intracorporeal lithotripter, LithAssist (LA; Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN), with the Swiss LithoClast Ultra (SLU; Boston Scientific, Boston, MA) for the fragmentation and removal of artificial stones made of gypsum-based cement.Ten soft and 20 hard ultracal-30 (U-30) stones were fragmented using two lithotripters. We recorded the stone weight (grams) prior to placing them into a 60-mL syringe for fragmentation. We inserted a 30F percutaneous access sheath into the syringe and positioned the stone within its lumen. Next, we inserted the lithotripter into a right-angled nephroscope. We recorded the times required for first and complete stone disintegration, disintegration to 2?mm, and complete stone removal for each device. In addition, we recorded the stone mass following each minute of stone fragmentation.In total, we subjected 5 soft and 10 hard stones to SLU and LA, respectively. All soft stones were completely disintegrated and removed with both the SLU and LA device. For soft stones, disintegration to 2?mm (2.83±0.41 vs. 4.15±0.70 minutes, p=0.049), complete disintegration (3.18±0.20 vs. 6.40±1.95 minutes, p=0.038), and complete removal (3.30±0.22 vs. 8.82±1.05 minutes, p=0.001) were faster for the SLU compared with the LA. For hard stones, fragmentation was not accomplished with the SLU, whereas with the LA, mean time for first disintegration, disintegration to 2?mm, complete disintegration, and complete removal was 3.60±1.36, 7.25±3.33, 7.54±2.94, and 8.64±2.78 minutes, respectively.In this in vitro study, the SLU was more efficient for softer artificial stones, and the LA was more efficient for harder artificial stones.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Male Urogenital
