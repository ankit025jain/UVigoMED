{"id":71375,"title":"The role of interim 18F-FDG PET/CT in predicting early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to prove the diagnostic value of interim 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) scan for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) compared to other factors in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Twenty-seven patients with breast cancer were included in this retrospective study. They all underwent scheduled neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients underwent PET/CT at baseline, mid-point (interim), and preoperatively (after completion of chemotherapy). The metabolic response was calculated as follows: ?Standardized uptake value (SUV)(%)=(1st SUV(max)-2nd SUV(max))/1st SUV(max) Ã— 100.The change in SUVmax between baseline and interim PET/CT scans was significantly larger than between interim and preoperative PET/CT scan. An optimal cut-off ?SUV value of 78.3% was proposed for discriminating patients with pCR from those without pCR. Metabolic CR, defined as a change of SUV(max) greater than the cut-off value, can predict pCR according to univariate analysis (p=0.012; Relative risk (RR)=25.3). Furthermore, metabolic CR was the most powerful factor for predicting pCR than other possible factors according to multivariate analysis (p=0.003).It is possible to use interim (18)F-FDG PET-CT as an effective method to predict early response in patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075084","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.444253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.422783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.414053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.389409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.317942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.251888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Sport utility vehicle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Midpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Nd (digraph)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nd_(digraph)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"}]}
