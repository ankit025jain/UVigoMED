{"id":38455,"title":"18F-FDG PET/CT as a predictor of hereditary head and neck paragangliomas.","abstract":"Hereditary head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) account for at least 35% of all HNPGLs, most commonly due to germline mutations in SDHx susceptibility genes. Several studies about sympathetic paragangliomas have shown that (18)F-FDG PET/CT was not only able to detect and localize tumours, but also to characterize tumours ((18)F-FDG uptake being linked to SDHx mutations). However, the data concerning (18)F-FDG uptake specifically in HNPGLs have not been addressed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between (18)F-FDG uptake and the SDHx mutation status in HNPGL patients.(18)F-FDG PET/CT from sixty HNPGL patients were evaluated. For all lesions, we measured the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), and the uptake ratio defined as HNPGL-SUVmax over pulmonary artery trunk SUVmean (SUVratio). Tumour sizes were assessed on radiological studies.Sixty patients (53.3% with SDHx mutations) were evaluated for a total of 106 HNPGLs. HNPGLs-SUVmax and SUVratio were highly dispersed (1.2-30.5 and 1.0-17.0, respectively). The HNPGL (18)F-FDG uptake was significantly higher in SDHx versus sporadic tumours on both univariate and multivariate analysis (P = 0.002). We developed two models for calculating the probability of a germline SDHx mutation. The first one, based on a per-lesion analysis, had an accuracy of 75.5%. The second model, based on a per-patient analysis, had an accuracy of 80.0%.(18)F-FDG uptake in HNPGL is strongly dependent on patient genotype. Thus, the degree of (18)F-FDG uptake in these tumours can be used clinically to help identify patients in whom SDHx mutations should be suspected.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24422786","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.88057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Sympathetic nervous system","weight":0.480041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.220727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.181224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Paraganglioma","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraganglioma"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Magnetic susceptibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility"},{"name":"Biological dispersal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_dispersal"}]}
