{"id":89275,"title":"Outcomes of total hip arthroplasty in spastic patients.","abstract":"Patients with spasticity and hip arthritis can present challenges to treatment. This investigation evaluated the effectiveness and safety of THA in patients with upper motor neuron disease. Twenty-seven consecutive patients with history of cerebral palsy (CP) or acquired spasticity (AS) underwent 30 THAs for treatment of hip arthritis. They were followed for an average 2.5 years (range 2.1-12.1). Patients with CP were more likely to require hip adductor release and hip flexor lengthening at the time of THA. Statistically significant improvements were made in Harris Hip Scores, pain scores, range of motion, ambulatory status, and the use ambulatory-assistive devices. There were no dislocations in this group. Patients with spasticity can benefit from THA in terms of pain relief and improved mobility with relatively low complications.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736289","annotations":[{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Spasticity","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Upper motor neuron","weight":0.783573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_motor_neuron"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Cerebral palsy","weight":0.762063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.676274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.606327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.574442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Spastic","weight":0.3352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic"},{"name":"Motor neurone disease","weight":0.231605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neurone_disease"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.147116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.139629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Hip flexors","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_flexors"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
