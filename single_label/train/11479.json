{"id":11479,"title":"Systemic and renal haemodynamic effects of fluid bolus therapy: sodium chloride versus sodium octanoate-balanced solution.","abstract":"Solutions with high chloride concentrations, like normal saline (NS), may adversely affect renal blood flow (RBF). We compared the systemic and renal haemodynamic effects of a bolus of NS with those of a novel isotonic solution containing a physiological concentration of chloride and sodium octanoate (SOct) in healthy conscious sheep.We performed an experimental double-blind cross-over animal study. After chronic pulmonary and renal artery flow probe insertion, animals were randomly assigned to receive rapid intravenous infusion (1 L over 30 minutes) of either NS or SOct. Haemodynamic parameters were recorded continuously before and after treatment.NS and SOct had similar dilutional effects on the haematocrit. Both induced a short-lived increase in cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral conductance which dissipated by 60 minutes. However, SOct increased RBF more than NS (peak values, 213.4±34.3mL/min v 179.3±35.6mL/min; P < 0.001) with a greater RBF/CO ratio (peak values, 12.2%±3.7% v 10.6%±3.6%; P < 0.001).NS and SOct appear to have similar systemic haemodynamic effects. However, OS significantly increases RBF compared with normal saline.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588433","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium chloride","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"},{"name":"Cardiac output","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_output"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.736259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.723799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.711457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.670234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.622606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.515082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.50234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.427193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.225681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.220727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"60 Minutes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Systemic circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_circulation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Renal blood flow","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_blood_flow"},{"name":"Tropical cyclone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"}]}
