{"id":84590,"title":"Effects of cinnamon on perineal pain and healing of episiotomy: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.","abstract":"Analgesic and wound-healing effects of cinnamon, a widely used spice, have been shown in laboratory rats. However, we found no human studies in this area.The aim of this study was to assess the effect of cinnamon on perineal pain and healing of episiotomy incision.In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 144 postpartum women were allocated into two groups, using stratified block randomization, 1 h after completion of episiotomy repair. They received cinnamon or placebo ointment, 2 mL every 12 h for 10 d.Perineal pain and wound healing were assessed using visual analogue scale (0-10) and Redness, Edema, Ecchymosis, Discharge, Approximation scale (0-15), respectively. General linear model was used to compare the groups on the outcomes adjusted for baseline values and stratified factors.Follow-up rate was 100% up to the 8 h time point in both groups, and 86% (62 of 72) in the cinnamon group and 85% (61 of 72) in the placebo group at day 10-11 after delivery. Pain score in the cinnamon group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group at (4±1) h (adjusted difference: -0.6, 95% confidence interval: -1.0 to -0.2) and (8±1) h (-0.9, -1.4 to -0.3) after intervention, and on the 10-11th day after delivery (-1.4, -2.0 to -0.7). Also the cinnamon group showed significantly more improvement than the control group in healing score at (8±1) h (-0.2, -0.4 to -0.04) and the 10-11th day after delivery (-1.6, -2.0 to -1.1).Cinnamon can be used for reducing perineal pain and improving healing of episiotomy incision.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
