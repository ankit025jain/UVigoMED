{"id":53284,"title":"Preventive effect of Zea mays L. (purple waxy corn) on experimental diabetic cataract.","abstract":"Recently, substances possessing antioxidant can prevent cataractogenesis of diabetic cataract. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the anticataract effect of Zea mays L. (purple waxy corn), a flavonoids rich plant, in experimental diabetic cataract. Enucleated rat lenses were incubated in artificial aqueous humor containing 55 mM glucose with various concentrations of Zea mays L. (purple waxy corn) ranging between 2, 10, and 50 mg/mL at room temperature for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, the evaluation of lens opacification, MDA level, and the activities of SOD, CAT, GPx, and AR in lens were performed. The results showed that both medium and high doses of extract decreased lens opacity together with the decreased MDA level. In addition, medium dose of extract increased GPx activity while the high dose decreased AR activity. No other significant changes were observed. The purple waxy corn seeds extract is the potential candidate to protect against diabetic cataract. The mechanism of action may occur via the decreased oxidative stress and the suppression of AR. However, further research in vivo is still essential.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24527449","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.85154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Maize","weight":0.775718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.775346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.702753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.691466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.47633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.423162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.406281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.30435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.238155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Room temperature","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.133549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Aqueous humour","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"},{"name":"Waxy corn","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxy_corn"},{"name":"Purple","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Wax","weight":0.0181577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax"},{"name":"Arkansas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"},{"name":"Humour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"}]}
