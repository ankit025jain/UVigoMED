{"id":46104,"title":"miR-1303 targets claudin-18 gene to modulate proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells.","abstract":"MicroRNAs have emerged as important gene regulators and are recognized as important molecules in carcinogenesis. However, the effects of microRNA-1303 (miR-1303) on gastric cancer (GC) cells and the upstream regulation of GC-associated claudin-18 gene (CLDN18) remain unclear. miR-1303 may be involved in the tumorigenesis of GC by targeting CLDN18.The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of miR-1303 targeting of CLDN18 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of human GC cells.The expression of miR-1303 and claudin-18 in GC tissues and gastric cancer cell lines were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. CCK8 and colony formation assays were performed to study the influence of miR-1303 on the proliferation of the GC cell lines. Transwell and wound-healing assays were carried out to investigate the effect of miR-1303 on the invasion and migration of GC cell lines. Luciferase reporter assays, restore assays and western blotting were used to demonstrate whether CLDN18 is a direct target of miR-1303.miR-1303 was significantly overexpressed whereas claudin-18 was downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines, which was significantly associated with tumor size, location invasion, histologic type and tumor-node-metastasis stage. Cell proliferation rates were reduced, and cell invasion and migratory ability was significantly restricted in miR-1303 inhibitor-transfected groups. miR-1303 could bind to the putative binding sites in CLDN18 mRNA 3'-UTR and visibly lower the expression of claudin-18. The introduction of claudin-18 without 3'-UTR restored the miR-1303 promoting migration function.Downregulation of miR-1303 can inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells by targeting CLDN18.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647998","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.8572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.825552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.804735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.76801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.767944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.74092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.595181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.453533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.210315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Claudin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudin"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Cholecystokinin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Bird migration","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
