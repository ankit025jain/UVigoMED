{"id":72721,"title":"Current organisation of follow-up does not meet cancer patients' needs.","abstract":"For cancer patients, traditional follow-up care is considered unsuitable and unsustainable. The patient perspective seems often to be absent in the ongoing debate about alternative strategies for follow-up care. Based on a national survey from 2012, the objective of this study was to examine cancer patients' support needs regarding physiological and emotional problems during follow-up and to identify factors associated with their needs and any unmet needs.Patients diagnosed with cancer in the period from April to September 2010 were invited to participate. A total of 4,401 patients responded (response rate = 64%). The risks in terms of prevalence rate ratios of having needs and unmet needs for both physiological and emotional problems were estimated using the Poisson regression.The study showed that 60% of the patients had needs for support regarding physiological and emotional problems, and half of the patients reported unmet needs. Younger patients and patients with co-morbidity were more likely to report needs and unmet needs for physiological and emotional support. Treatment complexity and setting of follow-up were not associated with unmet needs.The study underlines that the current organisation of follow-up does not meet cancer patients' needs. Several factors are associated with both needs and unmet needs. Hence, a more sustainable approach for follow-up care may consist in stratification tailored to the patients' different needs. In such an approach, more focus should be on age-specific needs and the impact of co-morbidity.The study is funded by the Danish Cancer Society.The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (J. no. 2010-41-4694). According to the Danish Act on Research Ethics Review of Health Research Projects (S. 8(3) of Act No. 402 of 28 May 2003), no ethical approval was needed.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947626","annotations":[{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.695352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.563836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ethics","weight":0.482719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.468014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.441581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.440757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.368039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Home care","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Medical ethics","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ethics"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Privacy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Global warming controversy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy"},{"name":"May 28","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_28"},{"name":"402","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/402"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"}]}
