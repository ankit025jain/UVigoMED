{"id":78185,"title":"Evidence for genotype-phenotype correlation for OTOF mutations.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the auditory phenotype in subjects with OTOF gene mutations to describe genotype-phenotype correlations.Twenty-two affected members from three families with homozygous OTOF mutations were included. Nine subjects were evaluated audiologically with otoscopic examination, pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry with acoustic reflex testing, auditory brain stem responses, and otoacoustic emission tests.Homozygous c.4718T>C (p.Ile1573Thr) mutation was associated with the auditory neuropathy/auditory dys-synchrony (AN/AD) phenotype and with progressive sensorineural hearing loss in four siblings in one family, while homozygous c.4467dupC (p.I1490HfsX19) was associated with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss without AN/AD in four relatives in another family. Homozygous c.1958delC (p.Pro653LeufsX13) mutation was associated with moderate sensorineural hearing loss without AN/AD in one affected person in an additional family.The audiological phenotype associated with different OTOF mutations appears to be consistently different suggesting the presence of a genotype-phenotype correlation.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746455","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.936098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Acoustic reflex","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_reflex"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.735628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Audiometry","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiometry"},{"name":"Otoacoustic emission","weight":0.637842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otoacoustic_emission"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.536901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.505744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.466329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Tympanometry","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanometry"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.206224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"},{"name":"Reflex","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0324486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"OTOF","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTOF"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"1573","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1573"},{"name":"653","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/653"},{"name":"1490","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1490"},{"name":"Isoleucine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Threonine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
