{"id":89287,"title":"Novel layer-by-layer structured nanofibrous mats coated by protein films for dermal regeneration.","abstract":"Layer-by-layer coating technique is effective in modifying the surface of nanofibrous mats, but overmuch film-coating makes the mats less porous to hardly suit the condition for tissue engineering. We developed novel nanofibrous mats layer-by-layer coated by silk fibroin and lysozyme on the cellulose electrospun template via electrostatic interaction. The film-coating assembled on the mats was not excessive because the charge of the proteins varied in the coating process due to different pH value. In addition, pure nature materials made the mats nontoxic, biodegradable and low-cost. The morphology and composition variation during layer-by-layer coating process was investigated and the results showed that the structure and thickness of film-coatings could be well-controlled. The antibacterial assay and in vitro cell experiments indicated that the mats could actively inhibit bacteria and exhibit excellent biocompatibility. In vivo implant assay further verified the mats cultured with human epidermal cells could promote wound healing and avoid wound infection. Therefore, these mats showed promising prospects when performed for dermal reconstruction.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Wounds and
