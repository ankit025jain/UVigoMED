{"id":60767,"title":"CD5 negative mantle cell lymphoma: a different clinical entity?","abstract":"We report herein a 77-year-old patient with CD5 negative mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We further review the existing literature on clinicolaboratory features of this rare MCL subtype. Although most of the patients in the literature (including ours) had advanced stage at diagnosis, splenomegaly, and bone marrow involvement, they displayed prompt and durable responses to conventional treatment. We postulate that CD5 surface antigen expression could have prognostic implications in MCL. Further research and a larger number of patients are necessary in order to validate these findings.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830117","annotations":[{"name":"Splenomegaly","weight":0.842679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.805725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.714064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Axiom","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom"},{"name":"Mantle cell lymphoma","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Medial collateral ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"CD5 (protein)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD5_(protein)"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
