{"id":65765,"title":"Fc? receptor IIIa single-nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes affect human IgG binding and are associated with lupus nephritis in African Americans.","abstract":"To investigate whether the Fc? receptor IIIa-66L/R/H (Fc?RIIIa-66L/R/H) polymorphism influences net effective receptor function and to assess if the FCGR3A combined genotypes formed by Fc?RIIIa-66L/R/H and Fc?RIIIa-176F/V, as well as copy number variation (CNV), confer risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis.Fc?RIIIa variants, expressed on A20 IIA1.6 cells, were used in flow cytometry-based human IgG-binding assays. Using Pyrosequencing methodology, FCGR3A single-nucleotide polymorphism and CNV genotypes were determined in a cohort of 1,728 SLE patients and 2,404 healthy controls.The Fc?RIIIa-66L/R/H (rs10127939) polymorphism influenced ligand binding capacity in the presence of the Fc?RIIIa-176V (rs396991) allele. There was a trend toward an association of the low-binding Fc?RIIIa-176F allele with lupus nephritis among African Americans (P = 0.0609) but not among European Americans (P > 0.10). Nephritis among African American patients with SLE was associated with Fc?RIIIa low-binding haplotypes containing the 66L/R/H and 176F variants (P = 0.03) and with low-binding genotype combinations (P = 0.002). No association was observed among European American patients with SLE. The distribution of FCGR3A CNV was not significantly different among controls and SLE patients with or without nephritis.Fc?RIIIa-66L/R/H influences ligand binding. The low-binding haplotypes formed by 66L/R/H and 176F confer enhanced risk of lupus nephritis in African Americans. FCGR3A CNVs are not associated with SLE or lupus nephritis in either African Americans or European Americans.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782186","annotations":[{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.77845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.756407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.741196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.584258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.534824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.512999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.416068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Fc receptor","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fc_receptor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.297026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Fragment crystallizable region","weight":0.124839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.0932836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"A20 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A20_road_(England)"},{"name":"European American","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_American"},{"name":"Pyrosequencing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrosequencing"},{"name":"Lupus nephritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_nephritis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"L.
