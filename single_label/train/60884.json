{"id":60884,"title":"Comparative effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin from different manufacturing processes on Kawasaki disease.","abstract":"The comparative effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for Kawasaki disease was regarded as inconclusive in the international guidelines. However, several new evidences have been published in recent years.A literature search of PubMed was conducted using key words of \"Kawasaki disease or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome\" and \"immunoglobulin\" in combination. Only original articles published after 2004 were selected. A total of 813 papers were found in PubMed. These papers were screened manually by their titles and abstracts.Patients treated with IVIG prepared by betapropiolactonation might have worse outcome (a higher non-responsive rate in one report and a higher rate of coronary aneurysm in two reports). Storage of IVIG in acidic solution might be correlated with a higher rate of coronary aneurysm (two reports).Different processes of preparation and conditions of preservation of IVIG may have profound effects on its clinical effectiveness. Randomized controlled studies are needed to further elucidate this issue.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24801230","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.857106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.772104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.705498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Intravenous immunoglobulin","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_immunoglobulin"},{"name":"Kawasaki disease","weight":0.405556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_disease"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.379087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.37611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.102313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Coronary artery aneurysm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_aneurysm"},{"name":"Food preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation"},{"name":"813","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/813"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Keyword (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Scientific journal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"}]}
