{"id":14641,"title":"PEP-1-PEA-15 protects against toxin-induced neuronal damage in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.","abstract":"PEA-15 is abundantly expressed in both neurons and astrocytes throughout the brain. It is a multifunctional protein with the ability to increase cell survival via anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative properties. However, the function of PEA-15 in neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of PEA-15 on neuronal damage induced by MPP(+) in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and BV2 microglia cells and in a MPTP-induced PD mouse model using cell-permeable PEP-1-PEA-15.PEP-1-PEA-15 was purified using affinity chromatography. Cell viability and DNA fragmentation were examined by MTT assay and TUNEL staining. Dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the animal model was examined by immunohistochemistry.PEP-1-PEA-15 transduced into the SH-SY5Y and BV2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Transduced PEP-1-PEA-15 protected against MPP(+)-induced toxicity by inhibiting intracellular ROS levels and DNA fragmentation. Further, it enhanced the expression levels of Bcl-2 and caspase-3 while reducing the expression levels of Bax and cleaved caspase-3. We found that PEP-1-PEA-15 transduced into the substantia nigra and prevented dopaminergic neuronal cell death in a MPTP-induced PD mouse. Also, we showed the neuroprotective effects in the model by demonstrating that treatment with PEP-1-PEA-15 ameliorated MPTP-induced behavioral dysfunctions and increased dopamine levels in the striatum.PEP-1-PEA-15 can efficiently transduce into cells and protects against neurotoxin-induced neuronal cell death in vitro and in vivo.These results demonstrate the potential for PEP-1-PEA-15 to provide a new strategy for protein therapy treatment of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including PD.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Animal
