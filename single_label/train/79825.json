{"id":79825,"title":"Graphene and carbon nanotube composite enabling a new prospective treatment for trichomoniasis disease.","abstract":"We report the synthesis and application of novel graphene oxide and carbon nanotube oxide (GCN-O) composite. First, pristine multi-walled carbon nanotube was prepared by chemical vapour deposition furnace and then exfoliated and oxidised simultaneously by oxygen plasma etching. The superficial and volumetric compositions of GCN-O were measured by XPS spectroscopy and EDX spectroscopy, respectively. Both XPS and EDX analyses evidence that the GCN-O is composed of up to 20% of oxygen atoms. As a result, GCN-O forms a stable colloidal aqueous solution and shows to have strong interaction with the cell membrane of Tritrichomonas foetus protozoa, making easy its application as a drug carrier. Trichomoniasis infection of cattle is a devastating disease for cattle producers, causing some damages to females and fetus, and the abortion is the most serious result of this disease. There is no effective treatment for trichomoniasis infection yet. Therefore, new treatment, especially one with no collateral effects in animals, is required. With this goal in mind, our results suggest that water dispersible composite is a novel nanomaterial, promising for Trichomoniasis infection treatment and as therapeutic delivery agent as well.
