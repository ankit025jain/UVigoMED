{"id":43710,"title":"A soluble form of IL-27R? is a natural IL-27 antagonist.","abstract":"IL-27 is a cytokine of the IL-12 family that plays a key role in the regulation of inflammatory and T cell responses. Its receptor is composed of IL-27R? and gp130 and activates the STAT pathway. We show in this study, using an ELISA that we developed, that a naturally occurring soluble form of IL-27R? (sIL-27R?) is produced by human activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, and various cell lines. sIL-27R? is present at a mean concentration of 10,344 Â± 1,274 pg/ml in the sera from healthy individuals. Biochemical studies showed that sIL-27R? is released as two N-glycosylated variants of ? 90 and ? 70 kDa. In IL-27R?-transfected COS7 cells, primary cells, and cell lines, production of sIL-27R? is inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitors GM6001 and TAPI-0. Importantly, natural sIL-27R? binds rIL-27, inhibits IL-27 binding to its cell surface receptor, and is a potent inhibitor of IL-27 signaling, as shown by its ability to specifically block IL-27-mediated STAT activation, at low molar excess over IL-27. Also, we found that serum levels of sIL-27R? were elevated in patients with Crohn's disease, a Th1-mediated disease. These findings suggest that sIL-27R? may play important immunoregulatory functions under normal and pathological conditions.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771852","annotations":[{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.848007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.810514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Cell surface receptor","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_surface_receptor"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.737169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.711457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.702841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.659865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.601962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.533855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.531077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.522564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.163251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Myelocyte","weight":0.102975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelocyte"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"}]}
