{"id":35328,"title":"A common factor suppresses thickening in young women with malar area port wine stains and delays low density lipoprotein elevation: is it estrogen?","abstract":"Port wine stains in the malar area of the face can develop thickening in early adult life. We began a study with a hypothesis that this thickening can be associated with elevation of low density lipoprotein. In a retrospective review, we divided 53 subjects with malar port wine stains into 4 groups, adults 25-39 years of age with thickening, that age group without thickening, adults 40+ years of age with thickening, and that age group without thickening. Low density lipoprotein levels in the subjects were compared to age and sex matched controls randomly selected from the general Dermatology clinic. The younger subjects with thickening demonstrated significantly higher low density lipoprotein levels than their controls (p .0082) and without thickening lower low density lipoprotein levels than their controls with great significance (p .00058). The subjects without thickening also consisted mainly of women. The low density lipoprotein levels in the older age groups, whether thickened or not, demonstrated no significant difference in low density lipoprotein levels between subjects and controls. This led to a new hypothesis that there is a factor in a subgroup of young adult women with malar port wine stains that suppresses thickening and delays the elevation of low density lipoprotein and that this factor might be estrogen. The implications of this hypothesis are that it could define a marker for a subset of the population that might be protected from the diseases associated with early elevation of low density lipoprotein and provide a source of cutaneous tissue for studying the basic science of this protection (although limited by cosmetic considerations). Future laboratory research to test the new hypothesis might include testing blood of women with malar port wine stains with or without thickening for estrogen and other sex hormones. It might also include skin biopsies to study receptors for estrogen, other sex hormones, and angiogenic factors in malar port wine stains with or without thickening. Future clinical research might include a long term prospective project to study the development of low density lipoprotein related diseases in women with malar port wine stains with or without thickening over years.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661938","annotations":[{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.704693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.581383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.574425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.568225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.479772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.42438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.351959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Sex steroid","weight":0.330015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_steroid"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.288149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.27488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Wine","weight":0.194318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.159783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Port wine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_wine"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Port","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Thickening agent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening_agent"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
