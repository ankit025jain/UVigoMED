{"id":38247,"title":"Peristeen integrated transanal irrigation system successfully treats faecal incontinence in children.","abstract":"Faecal incontinence secondary to myelomeningocele, Hirschsprung disease, and anorectal anomalies remains a significant and common problem. We aimed to report our 5-year experience with the Peristeen trans-anal irrigation system (TAIS) to manage such children.This study was a combination of a retrospective case note review and assessment using a validated quality of life questionnaire (QOL) to determine pre- and post-TAIS bowel function and continence. QOL scores and functional outcomes before and during TAIS use were compared using Wilcoxon matched pairs test (p < 0.05 significant).Twenty-four children (median age 6 years) were managed with the TAIS 2006-2011 to treat faecal incontinence. Three did not tolerate the system. Median QOL scores in 20 out of 21 patients using TAIS demonstrated significant improvement in bowel management and continence. Two discontinued use due to failure to improve continence; one underwent the Malone antegrade continence enema (MACE) procedure and one returned to oral/rectal medications. Nineteen of 24 patients (79%) continue to use TAIS.The Peristeen TAIS is an effective, safe, non-operative alternative to MACE in children with faecal incontinence, if initial compliance can be achieved.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439630","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.606065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.564734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hirschsprung's disease","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.33035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Enema","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enema"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Spina bifida","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_bifida"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Malone antegrade continence enema","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malone_antegrade_continence_enema"},{"name":"Note","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note"},{"name":"Racial segregation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"},{"name":"Toshiba","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.0165534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pair skating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_skating"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
