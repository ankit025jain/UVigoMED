{"id":91423,"title":"Transthoracic minimally invasive closure for the treatment of ruptured sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm: a case report.","abstract":"Ruptured sinus of the valsalva aneurysm (RSVA ) is a rare cardiac anomaly. Nearly 80% of patients will have symptom when RSVA ruptures into one of the cardiac chambers. The conventional treatment of RSVA is surgical repair under cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) or percutaneous catheter closure. Here, we present one case of RSVA undergo transthoracic minimally invasive closure, which is a novel methods for the treatment of RSVA. We describe a thirty four-year-old Asian man with chest pain and palpitation for 3 days. Echocardiography showed that RSVA presented in the right coronary cusp. The sinus opened into the right atrium, and the diameter of the opening was 5 mm. The opening was successfully closed by transthoracic minimally invasive closure with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) occluder.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506848","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Palpitation","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitation"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Right atrium","weight":0.841184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_atrium"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.801736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.743642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Aortic sinus","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_sinus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Valsalva maneuver","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.575932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.545346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.417797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.410915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Heart chamber","weight":0.213079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_chamber"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Ruptured spleen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruptured_spleen"}]}
