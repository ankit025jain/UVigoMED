{"id":83505,"title":"[Clinical efficacy evaluation of needle-knife for lumber disc herniation based on surface electromyography signals].","abstract":"To apply needle-knife to treat lumber disc herniation (LDH) and surface electromyography were used to analyze biomechanical characteristic of patient's lumber muscle to make a comprehensive evaluation on its efficacy.Thirty patients who met the inclusive criteria were selected and treated with needle-knife, once a week for 2 weeks. Visual analogue scale (VAS), ASLR and JOA score before and after treatment were observed. Surface electromyography was applied to test the surface electromyography signals. AEMG, MFs and MPF were calculated before and after the treatment.After treatment, VAS was significantly reduced, ASLR, JOA, AEMG and MPF were obviously increased, and the absolute value of MFs was lowed (all P < 0.01).The needle-knife could significantly relieve lumbar muscle strength, muscle tone and muscle fatigue, improve in the imbalance of lumbar extensor muscle group, leading to the recovery of biomechanical characteristic, and the clinical efficacy is superior.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335263","annotations":[{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.732188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.606408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.477171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.349608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.277478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.260156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.256612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.172202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.124397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Absolute value","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value"},{"name":"Address space layout randomization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_Preservation_Act_of_1970"},{"name":"Signal (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(physiology)"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Lumber","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
