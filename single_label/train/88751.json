{"id":88751,"title":"Issues of cultural diversity in acquired brain injury (ABI) rehabilitation.","abstract":"With the general population in the United States becoming increasingly diverse, it is important for rehabilitation professionals to develop the capacity to provide culturally sensitive treatment. This is especially relevant when working with minority populations who have a higher risk for brain injury and poorer rehabilitation outcomes.This article presents a number of clinical vignettes to illustrate how cultural factors can influence behavior in patients recovering from brain injury, as well as rehabilitation staff. The main objectives are to raise awareness among clinicians and stimulate research ideas by highlighting some real world examples of situations where a specialized, patient-centered approach needs to consider factors of cultural diversity.Because one's own world view impacts the way we see the world and interpret behavior, it is important to understand one's own ethnocentrism when dealing with a diverse population of patients with brain injury where behavioral sequelae are often expected. Being able to see behavior after brain injury with an open mind and taking into account cultural and contextual factors is an important step in developing culturally competent rehabilitation practices.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796439","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.815553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.664123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.634161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.449299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Ethnocentrism","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnocentrism"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"World view","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_view"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.237726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.22596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.208226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Cultural anthropology","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.149309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.146641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Cultural diversity","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_diversity"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Sketch comedy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy"},{"name":"Application binary interface","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"},{"name":"Issues (Korn album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issues_(Korn_album)"},{"name":"Cultural competence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_competence"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"}]}
