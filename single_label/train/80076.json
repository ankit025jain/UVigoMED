{"id":80076,"title":"[Investigation on the current situation of human soil-borne nematode infection in Shapingba district of Chongqing].","abstract":"By stratified cluster sampling method, 2 urban and 2 rural fields were selected from Shapingha district of Chongqing for survey in December 2009 to February 2010. According to the Administrating Regulations of National Investigation on Important Human Parasitic Diseases, Kato-Katz method was used to examine human intestinal soil-borne nematode eggs, and adhesive cellophane anal swab method was applied to examine Enterobius infection for children under 12 years old. 203 cases were found positive in 2121 subjects, with an infection rate of 9.6% (203/2 121), and the infection rate of hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura with mild infection mostly was 9.3% (197/2 121), 0.4% (8/2 121) and 0.1% (2/2 121), respectively. The rate among people over 50 years old was 15.5% (160/1 030), and the farmers was with 22.3%(113/506). The higher the education level, the lower the infection rate (P < 0.01), and there was a significant difference in the prevalence between urban (2.1%) and rural people (17.3%) (chi2 = 140.443 5, P < 0.01). The infection rate of soil-borne nematodes in Shapingba of Chongqing was much lower than the standard of II regions and most infected subjects were with hookworm infection.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809189","annotations":[{"name":"Hookworm","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm"},{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Ascaris lumbricoides","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris_lumbricoides"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.773461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Trichuris trichiura","weight":0.73874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris_trichiura"},{"name":"Enterobius","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobius"},{"name":"Ascaris","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.565941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.339591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Trichuris","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Cluster sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_sampling"},{"name":"Cellophane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellophane"},{"name":"Chongqing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing"},{"name":"Shapingba District","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapingba_District"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"1601","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1601"},{"name":"2032","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2032"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"}]}
