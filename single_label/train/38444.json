{"id":38444,"title":"[Rett syndrome].","abstract":"Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene, encoding MeCP2 protein. This protein is essential for the transcription and repression of other genes and is important for the development and plasticity of the central nervous system. Children with Rett syndrome initially develop normally but after a few months their development deteriorates.The case describes a girl aged 3 years 7 months whose development had initially been normal but then stagnated and was followed by a phase of regression. Her speech was lost and she developed severe dyspraxia with stereotypic hand movements characteristic of the condition. The clinical diagnosis of Rett syndrome was confirmed through genetic testing. Later on she developed epileptic seizures and a severe scoliosis for which surgical correction and stabilisation was carried out.Rett syndrome is a severe neurological developmental disorder that occurs almost exclusively in females and for which there is still no causal treatment. The treatment is multidisciplinary and based on clinical experience.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423488","annotations":[{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"Rett syndrome","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rett_syndrome"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.515152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Developmental disorder","weight":0.406604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disorder"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.370166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Neuroplasticity","weight":0.235995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"},{"name":"Developmental dyspraxia","weight":0.187122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_dyspraxia"},{"name":"MECP2","weight":0.0491452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECP2"},{"name":"Stereotype","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Repressor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor"},{"name":"Social movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
