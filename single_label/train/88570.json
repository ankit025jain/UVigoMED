{"id":88570,"title":"[Minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis for the treatment of 53 patients with complex ankle fractures].","abstract":"To explore the surgical method and its clinical effects of minimally invasive osteosynthesis on the treatment of complex ankle fractures.From January 2007 to December 2011, 53 patients with complex ankle fractures were treated with minimally invasive osteosynthesis. There were 31 males and 22 females, with an average age of 38.2 years old (ranged, 18 to 65). According to the system of Lauge-Hansen, 32 fractures were supination external rotation injury (grade WV), 13 fractures were pronation external rotation (grade III or IV), 5 fractures were pronation abduction (grade III); and 3 fractures can not be classified due to serious comminution fracture of fibula. According to the system of Denis-Weber, there were 4 cases with type A, 34 cases with type B and 15 cases with type C. Seven cases were open fractures. The duration from injuries to operation ranged from 2 hours to 14 days with an average of 5 days. The sequence of reduction and fixation of ankle fractures was firstly posterior malleolus, then medial malleolus and lateral malleolus, and inferior tibiofibular syndesmosis lastly. The fractures of posterior malleolus were reduced and fixed through anterior ankle approaches; the fractures of medial and lateral malleolus were percutaneously fixed with bolts or blade plate or tensile force band; and inferior tibiofibular syndesmosis were firmly fixed if necessary. Baird-Jackson scoring system was used to evaluate clinical effects.Forty-eight patients were followed up from 10 to 36 months with an average of 13 months. The fractures got healing with an average time of 12 weeks (ranged, 10 to 18). According to the Baird-Jackson scoring system, the mean score of ankle function was 94.7 +/- 4.2, and 28 cases obtained excellent results, 15 good, 3 fair and 2 poor. One case experienced superficial infections and was cured by changing dressings, 2 cases experienced fixed syndesmosis screw breakage.The surgical method of minimally invasive osteosynthesis can ensure the anatomical join restoration, protect the blood supply of fracture end, rebuild the function of ankle joint, obtain satisfactory clinical results in treating complex ankle fractures.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24826483","annotations":[{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.898264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Malleolus","weight":0.877127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleolus"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"External rotation","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_rotation"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Pronation","weight":0.735098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronation"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Supination","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supination"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.684946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.664089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.37274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.316985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Reduction (orthopedic surgery)","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(orthopedic_surgery)"},{"name":"Lower extremity of tibia","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_tibia"},{"name":"Syndesmosis","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndesmosis"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.113871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0863578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0421407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Sword","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
