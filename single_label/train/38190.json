{"id":38190,"title":"Connective tissue disorders and cardiovascular complications: the indomitable role of transforming growth factor-beta signaling.","abstract":"Marfan Syndrome (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (LDS) represent heritable connective tissue disorders that cosegregate with a similar pattern of cardiovascular defects (thoracic aortic aneurysm, mitral valve prolapse/regurgitation, and aortic root dilatation with regurgitation). This pattern of cardiovascular defects appears to be expressed along a spectrum of severity in many heritable connective tissue disorders and raises suspicion of a relationship between the normal development of connective tissues and the cardiovascular system. Given the evidence of increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) signaling in MFS and LDS, this signaling pathway may represent the common link in this relationship. To further explore this hypothetical link, this chapter will review the TGF-? signaling pathway, heritable connective tissue syndromes related to TGF-? receptor (TGFBR) mutations, and discuss the pathogenic contribution of TGF-? to these syndromes with a primary focus on the cardiovascular system.
