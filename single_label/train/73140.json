{"id":73140,"title":"[Brain metastases: epidemiology, diagnosis and imaging].","abstract":"The incidence of brain metastases is poorly documented but seems to be increasing. Brain metastases occur in 10% of patients with cancer. Extending the life of patients and improved diagnostic techniques seem to be the cause of this increase. The diagnosis is made either on systematic reviews of sick patients, either before the onset of a neurological disorder. Brain MRI is the gold standard to evaluate the number, size and location of brain metastases. Achieving an histological examination should be performed in cases of diagnostic uncertaintly. Inaugural metastases occure in 20% of cases. The general practionner should investigate primary cancer quickly to refer the patient to an appropriate specialist. The management of brain metastases is multidisciplinary and requires coordination of different practitioners.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923057","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.776157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.726497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Brain metastasis","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Motor coordination","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_coordination"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"}]}
