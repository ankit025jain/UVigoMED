{"id":83707,"title":"[Certain regular features of \"fountaining\" blood stain formation depending on the height, angle of incidence, and properties of the barrier material].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms of formation and morphological features of blood stains during arterial hemorrhage. \"Fountaining\" blood stains were simulated with the use of the specially designed device with an output pressure of 116.5 mm Hg. Blood droplets were allowed to fall down at different angles onto the surfaces differing in the stain-receptive properties. A total of 2200 blood stains were simulated and analysed. The data obtained indicate that traces of blood may be significantly different depending on the character of the blood-receptive surface, the height of fall and the angle of incidence of blood droplets. The results of the study can be used to improve the quality of forensic medical expertise of material evidence and reconstruct the circumstances of an event or offence.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25271347","annotations":[{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.475548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.430849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.381271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Angle of incidence","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.200316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.153297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.129769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Drop (liquid)","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_(liquid)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Objective (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_(optics)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Bloodstain pattern analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodstain_pattern_analysis"},{"name":"Medical jurisprudence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_jurisprudence"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Materiality (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materiality_(law)"},{"name":"Output","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"}]}
