{"id":55569,"title":"In vivo confocal laser microscopy of morphologic changes after simultaneous LASIK and accelerated collagen crosslinking for myopia: one-year results.","abstract":"To evaluate the safety of corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) combined with laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).Shinagawa LASIK Center, Tokyo, Japan.Case series.Bilateral myopic LASIK patients had unilateral accelerated CXL (KXL System) in the nondominant eye. After LASIK, riboflavin 0.1% was instilled in the residual stromal bed for 60 seconds. After the riboflavin was washed out and the flap placed in its original position, ultraviolet-A light (30 mW/cm(2)) was administered for 60 seconds. The LASIK-CXL eyes and the LASIK-only eyes were compared. The uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities, manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), keratometry values, endothelial cell density (ECD), pachymetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), keratoconus match index (KMI), and 37 parameters from a dynamic bidirectional applanation device (Ocular Response Analyzer) were analyzed. Morphologic changes were evaluated using confocal microscopy.No significant differences in UDVA, CDVA, MRSE, ECD, dynamic bidirectional applanation readings (eg, CH, CRF, KMI), or 37 additional parameters were found between the 2 groups (P>.05). Increased hyperreflectivity and a demarcation line similar to that seen after CXL were observed in the LASIK-CXL eyes. The demarcation line (mean depth 200.04 ?m Â± 27.01 [SD]; range 178 to 278 ?m) was present in 23 eyes (95.8%); the line was well defined in 2 eyes (8.3%) and faint in 21 eyes (87.5%).Combined LASIK-CXL was safe, causing insignificant corneal biomechanical and morphologic changes similar to those with CXL treatment only.No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857441","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence
