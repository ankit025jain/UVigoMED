{"id":42766,"title":"Limoniastrum guyonianum aqueous gall extract induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells by inhibiting calpain activity.","abstract":"Several studies have reported that plant-derived natural products have cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties. The aim of the present study was to determine the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic potential of Limoniastrum guyonianum aqueous gall extract (G extract) on human colorectal cancer BE cell line and, if so, to characterize the mechanism involved. The G extract-induced growth inhibitory effect was associated with an arrest of cell cycle progression in G2/M phase as shown by the cell phase distribution. In addition, G extract promoted in a concentration-dependent manner these cells towards apoptosis as indicated by the presence of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In order to characterize the mechanism involved in the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic signaling pathway activated by G extract, calpain activity and the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4A) were determined. The present findings indicated that G extract exhibited significant inhibitory activity against calpain and caused a marked and concentration-dependent upregulation of p16(INK4A). These effects could be ascribed to the presence of condensed tannins and polyphenols such as epicatechin and epigallocatechin gallate in G extract.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828012","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.806052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"M phase","weight":0.726801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_phase"},{"name":"Calpain","weight":0.661871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calpain"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.641092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.601962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.569068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Catechin","weight":0.506199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechin"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Epigallocatechin gallate","weight":0.372697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigallocatechin_gallate"},{"name":"Tannin","weight":0.354399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.305469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.255282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"G2 phase","weight":0.165536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G2_phase"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Phenolic compounds in wine","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenolic_compounds_in_wine"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Gallic acid","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_acid"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"P16 (gene)","weight":0.0239641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P16_(gene)"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Ink","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink"},{"name":"Gall","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Gallocatechol","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallocatechol"}]}
