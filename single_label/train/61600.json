{"id":61600,"title":"Laboratory diagnostics of inherited platelet disorders.","abstract":"Abstract Inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) are the general and common denomination of a broad number of different rare and congenital pathologies affecting platelets. Even if these disorders are characterized by widely heterogeneous clinical presentations, all of them are commonly present as defects in hemostasis. Platelet number and/or function are affected by a wide spectrum of severity. IPDs might be associated with defects in bone marrow megakaryocytopoiesis and, rarely, with somatic defects. Although in the last few years new insights in the genetic bases and pathophysiology of IPDs have greatly improved our knowledge of these disorders, much effort still needs to be made in the field of laboratory diagnosis. This review discusses the laboratory approach for the differential diagnosis of the most common IPDs, suggesting a common multistep flowchart model which starts from the simpler test (platelet count) ending with the more selective and sophisticated analyses.
