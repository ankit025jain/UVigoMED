{"id":43301,"title":"PLC?1: a potential target of RNA interference therapy for gastric cancer.","abstract":"Phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLC?1) has been recently identified as a novel potential biomarker for gastric cancer because of its critical role in inflammation and tumorigenesis. Until now, there are no further reports to investigate the feasibility of gene therapy by suppressing PLC?1 expression for gastric cancer. In this study, a small interfering RNA (shRNA) targeting PLC?1 was firstly transfected into gastric cancer cells in order to silence PLC?1 expression. Both mRNA and protein expression of PLC?1 in gastric cancer cells significantly reduced by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Moreover, subsequent results revealed that PLC?1 shRNA depressed the in vitro and in vivo growth of gastric cancer cells by using MTT assay and tumor xenograft experiment. Furthermore, after PLC?1 shRNA transfection, the expression of proinflammatory molecules including tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), interleukin (IL)-6 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)-1 were unaffected, but only chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)-2 expression decreased in the gastric cancer cells. It is implied that PLC?1 may inhibit the growth of gastric cancer cells via CCL-2 protein mediated pathway. These results suggest that PLC?1 might be an alternative molecular target for gastric cancer gene therapy.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Digestive System
