{"id":81526,"title":"Is erosive tooth wear an oral disease?","abstract":"Erosive tissue loss is part of the physiological wear of teeth. Clinical features are an initial loss of tooth shine or luster followed by flattening of convex structures; with continuing acid exposure, concavities form on smooth surfaces, or grooving and cupping occur on incisal/occlusal surfaces. Dental erosion must be distinguished from other forms of wear, but can also contribute to general tissue loss by surface softening, thus modifying physical wear processes. The determination of dental erosion as a condition or pathology is relatively easy in the case of pain or endodontic complications, but is ambiguous in initial stages and in terms of function or esthetics. The impact of dental erosion on oral health is discussed. However, it can be concluded that in most cases dental erosion is best described as a condition, with the acid being of nonpathological origin.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993254","annotations":[{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.667324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.553642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Endodontics","weight":0.409197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.309099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth disease","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_disease"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Acid erosion","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_erosion"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Fire cupping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_cupping"},{"name":"Flattening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening"},{"name":"Glossary of boiler terminology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_boiler_terminology"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Lustre (mineralogy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(mineralogy)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
