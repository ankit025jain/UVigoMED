{"id":82187,"title":"HMGB1 localization during experimental periodontitis.","abstract":"This study sought to investigate the in vitro expression profile of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in murine periodontal ligament fibroblasts (mPDL) stimulated with LPS or IL-1? and in vivo during ligature- or LPS-induced periodontitis in rats.For the in vivo study, 36 rats were divided into experimental and control groups, and biopsies were harvested at 7-30?d following disease induction. Bone loss and inflammation were evaluated. HMGB1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and Western blot.Significant increases in mPDL HMGB1 mRNA occurred at 4, 8, and 12?h with protein expression elevated by 24?h. HMGB1 mRNA expression in gingival tissues was significantly increased at 15?d in the LPS-PD model and at 7 and 15?d in the ligature model. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a significant increase in the number of HMGB1-positive cells during the experimental periods.The results show that PDL cells produce HMGB1, which is increased and secreted extracellularly after inflammatory stimuli. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HMGB1 may be associated with the onset and progression of periodontitis, suggesting that further studies should investigate the potential role of HMGB1 on periodontal tissue destruction.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692854","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.779805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.762962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.647806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.599018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.579085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Periodontal fiber","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_fiber"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression_profiling"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.332706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.281209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.146247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"HMGB1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGB1"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
