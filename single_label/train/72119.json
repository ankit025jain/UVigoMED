{"id":72119,"title":"Transferrin-conjugated nanodiamond as an intracellular transporter of chemotherapeutic drug and targeting therapy for cancer cells.","abstract":"PEGylated fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) conjugated with Tf (FND-PEG-Tf) was investigated for targeted drug delivery.Human hepatoma (HepG2) and normal (L-02) cell lines were used to investigate the difference in cellular uptake of FND-PEG-Tf and its loading drug system. Nanoparticle uptake was evaluated by flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy.FND-PEG-Tf showed highly specific TfR-mediated uptake by HepG2 cells, relative to negative controls (L-02 cell), which was a strong correlation among TfR density on the cell surface. The mechanism of TfR-mediated uptake was attested by free Tf with FeÂ³? as a competitive agent. The difference in cell viability between L-02 and HepG2 cells treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) nanoparticles (FND-PEG-Tf-DOX) can be explained by FND-PEG-Tf, which can target drug delivery to cancer cells.FND-PEG-Tf can potentially be utilized in targeted cancer cell imaging and effective drug delivery for cancer therapy.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998271","annotations":[{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.912617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.675724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.610331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.602327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.484469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.440443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.430164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.409084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Targeted drug delivery","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.223495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.214558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.104334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Hydrochloride","weight":0.0430264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloride"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Confocal laser scanning microscopy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_laser_scanning_microscopy"},{"name":"Aggregated diamond nanorod","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregated_diamond_nanorod"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"}]}
