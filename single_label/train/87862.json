{"id":87862,"title":"[Treatment of proximal humeral fractures with percutaneous locking plate fixation through lateral deltoid approach].","abstract":"To investigate the effects of locking plate fixation through lateral deltoid approach for proximal humeral fracture combined with micro-invasive percutaneous plating (MIPPO) technique.From April 2009 to March 2012,26 patients with proximal humeral fractures were treated with proximal humeral locking system plate fixation through lateral deltoid approach, including 17 males and 9 females with an average age of 58 years old ranging from 28 to 76 years old. The time from injury to operation was 3 to 10 days (averaged 5.6 days). According to Neer typing for the proximal humeral fractures, 7 cases had 2 parts of fracture,15 had 3 parts of fracture,and 4 had 4 parts of fracture. The Neer score for shoulder function was evaluated.All patients were followed up,and the duration ranged from 10 to 21 months (averaged 13.6 months). All patients were achieved bony union,the average healing time was 12.5 weeks (ranged from 10 to 21 weeks). No humeral head necrosis and axillary nerve injury occurred. According to Neer scoring system,the total score was 88.36 +/- 7.82, pain 30.82 +/- 3.24, function 23.76 +/- 5.71, activity 17.59 +/- 5.36, anatomical position 7.03 +/- 2.39; the result was excellent in 18 cases, good in 5 cases, fair in 2 cases, poor in 1 case.Lateral deltoid approach combined with locking plate fixation for treatment of proximal humeral fracture has advantages of small invasion,less blood lossing, short operative time, stable fixation, high rate of fracture healing, and satisfactory functional recovery.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974431","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.726609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.688541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.639876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.430919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Deltoid muscle","weight":0.264229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoid_muscle"},{"name":"Axillary artery","weight":0.116707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_artery"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Upper extremity of humerus","weight":0.0574532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_extremity_of_humerus"},{"name":"Axillary nerve","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_nerve"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Typing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Neer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neer"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
