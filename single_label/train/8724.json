{"id":8724,"title":"Aberrant self-renewal and quiescence contribute to the aggressiveness of glioblastoma.","abstract":"Cancer cells with enhanced self-renewal capacity influence tumour growth in glioblastoma. So far, a variety of surrogate markers have been proposed to enrich these cells, emphasizing the need to devise new characterization methods. Here, we screen a large panel of glioblastoma cultures (n = 21) cultivated under stem cell-permissive conditions and identify several cell lines with enhanced self-renewal capacity. These cell lines are capable of matrix-independent growth and form fast-growing, orthotopic tumours in mice. Employing isolation, re-plating, and label-retention techniques, we show that self-renewal potential of individual cells is partitioned asymmetrically between daughter cells in a robust and cell line-specific fashion. This yields populations of fast- and slow-cycling cells, which differ in the expression of cell cycle-associated transcripts. Intriguingly, fast-growing cells keep their slow-cycling counterparts in a reversible state of quiescence associated with high chemoresistance. Our results suggest that two different subpopulations of tumour cells contribute to aberrant growth and tumour recurrence after therapy in glioblastoma.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756862","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.219329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.203847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0742319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"G0 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0_phase"},{"name":"Keep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Solitary confinement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Aberrant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberrant"}]}
