{"id":33989,"title":"Continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep in a child with karyotype 47, XYY.","abstract":"The XYY syndrome is a sex chromosome aneuploidy occurring in one of 1,000 live male births. Only few data exist regarding the correlation between this syndrome and epilepsy. An EEG pattern suggestive of benign focal epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes has recently been described in four XYY patients. We report the first patient with XYY trisomy, rolandic spikes, and atypical evolution with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWSS). The present report suggests that the association between an EEG pattern similar to that of BECTS and 47, XYY karyotype may not be coincidental. Moreover, we show that an atypical evolution with CSWSS may occur in this chromosomal disorder.
