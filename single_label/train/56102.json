{"id":56102,"title":"Imaging of naive myopic choroidal neovascularization by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"To assess the tomographic features of myopic choroidal neovascularization by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.We consecutively reviewed the charts of patients with pathologic myopia, recent visual acuity deterioration and active macular neovascularization. Specific tomographic changes were studied in 25 eyes by two authors independently.The mean age of patients eligible for the study was 63.4 (Â± 18.2) years. Main tomographic outcomes were the hyperreflectivity of the lesion in 88% of cases (95% CI 0.74-1.02), absence of the external limiting membrane in 88% (95% CI 0.84-1.02), and retinal thickening in 83% (95% CI 0.67-0.99). The internal plexiform layer remained discernible in 83% (95% CI 0.67-0.99) of cases, the inner nuclear layer in 62% (95% CI 0.37-0.80), the external plexiform layer in 48% (95% CI 0.27-0.69). Retinal edema was noted in 48% (95% CI 0.26-0.70) of patients.Myopic choroidal neovascularization appears predominantly hyperreflective, causes thickening of the corresponding retina and mainly involves the external retinal segments. Retinal fluid is infrequent.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751654","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.763324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.720697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.71776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.663822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.663138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.622654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.554331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.518766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Inner nuclear layer","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_nuclear_layer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.17667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.161443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Choroidal neovascularization","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroidal_neovascularization"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"741","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/741"},{"name":"841","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/841"},{"name":"670","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/670"},{"name":"270","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/270"},{"name":"260","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/260"},{"name":"370","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/370"},{"name":"Thickening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"}]}
