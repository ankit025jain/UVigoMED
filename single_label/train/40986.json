{"id":40986,"title":"Ectopic sebaceous glands in the oesophagus: a case report and review of literature.","abstract":"Most ectopic sebaceous glands have been reported in the tissues of ectodermal origin. However, there are relatively a few reports of ectopic sebaceous glands in the oesophagus, an organ of endodermal origin.We report the case of an asymptomatic 54-year-old man with ectopic oesophageal sebaceous glands. These lesions were incidentally observed in the distal oesophagus during screening endoscopy of gastric neoplasm and confirmed by histologic analysis.Surveillance or resection with regard to ectopic sebaceous glands in the oesophagus is generally not required since there is no known malignant potential. However, anti-reflux treatment may be sometimes needed, if such symptoms are present in patients. Also, these lesions should be differentiated from other pathologic lesions of oesophagus that need to be treated. Thus, greater attention of endoscopists is required for detection and differential diagnosis of these lesions. The narrow-band imaging mode and/or endoscopic biopsy may be helpful.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24966210","annotations":[{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.795421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.695988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.584828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.56053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sebaceous gland","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland"},{"name":"Ectoderm","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm"},{"name":"Endoderm","weight":0.0960068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoderm"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"}]}
