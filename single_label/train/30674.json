{"id":30674,"title":"Tactile stimulation and neonatal isolation affect behavior and oxidative status linked to cocaine administration in young rats.","abstract":"We investigated the influence of neonatal handling on cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), anxiety-like symptoms and oxidative status related to drug abstinence in young rats. Pups were submitted to tactile stimulation (TS) or neonatal isolation (NI10 or NI60) after birth, and then were submitted to CPP performed with cocaine. TS group did not show place preference, while unhandled (UH), NI10 and NI60 rats did. Handling was related to anxiety-like symptoms per se in UH and NI60 groups and this behavior was also observed in the cocaine-conditioned rats exposed to the same handlings. Both TS and NI10 pups treated or not with cocaine showed less anxiety-like behavior than animals submitted to other handlings. TS reduced protein carbonyl (PC) in cortex and NI60 increased PC in both striatum and hippocampus of cocaine-treated rats. Among cocaine-treated rats, both times of NI increased plasma lipoperoxidation levels, which was reduced by TS in erythrocytes. TS increased the catalase activity in brain areas, while other handlings did not change this. Both TS and NI10 increased plasma vitamin C levels. These findings indicate that neonatal handling can modify anxiety-like symptoms related to cocaine preference and abstinence, and its protective influence, especially TS, on the antioxidant system.
