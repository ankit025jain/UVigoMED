{"id":4503,"title":"Managing bleeding and emergency reversal of newer oral anticoagulants: a review for primary care providers.","abstract":"The therapeutic landscape for anticoagulation management is undergoing a shift from the use of traditional anticlotting agents such as heparins and warfarin as the only options to the growing adoption of newer target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) with novel mechanisms of action. Dabigatran, the first TSOAC approved for use in the United States, is a direct competitive inhibitor of thrombin. It has predictable kinetics, with an elimination half-life of 12 to 17 hours in healthy volunteers. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are selective inhibitors of factor Xa, and also display first-order kinetics. In younger healthy individuals, apixaban has an apparent half-life of approximately 12 hours, whereas rivaroxaban has an elimination half-life of 5 to 9 hours. Understanding the pharmacologic properties of these newer drugs can lead to better insights regarding their respective safety and efficacy profiles and their application in clinical practice. Laboratory assessments have been developed to measure the anticoagulant efficacy of these newer agents. However, the results of these tests can be highly variable, and are therefore not always useful for monitoring the anticoagulation effects of these agents. In addition, several strategies have been documented for the potential reversal of the anticoagulant effects of these drugs, from the temporary discontinuation of an agent before elective surgery to suggested emergency procedures in the case of major bleeding events. New, specific reversal agents for dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban are currently being developed, and dabigatran has received fast-track designation from the US Food and Drug Administration. Until comprehensive clinical guidelines are developed, institutions involved in emergency care should establish their own procedures for the management of patients undergoing anticoagulation who require emergency treatment. These protocols should include appropriate laboratory testing to assess anticoagulant activity as part of the inpatient workup if time allows, and the potential use of hemodialysis, prohemostatic agents, and reversal agents when available.","date":"2014-12-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and
