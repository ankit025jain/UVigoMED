{"id":51491,"title":"A solid-phase PEGylation strategy for protein therapeutics using a potent FGF21 analog.","abstract":"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine-acting hormone that has the potential to treat metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Development of FGF21 into a therapeutic has been hindered due to its low intrinsic bio-stability, propensity towards aggregation and its susceptibility to in vivo proteolytic degradation. In order to address these shortcomings, we've developed recombinant human FGF21 variants by strategically introducing cysteine residues via site-directed mutagenesis, and have also developed a solid-phase nickel affinity PEGylation strategy, whereby engineered, surface-exposed cysteine residues of immobilized proteins were used as a platform to efficiently and site-selectively conjugate with PEG-maleimide. The engineered PEGylated FGF21 conjugates retained its biological functions, as well as demonstrated an increase in half-life by over 211.3 min. By demonstrating the biological activity of the FGF21 analog as a prototype, we have also provided a \"generalized\" solid-phase approach to effectively increase serum half-life of protein therapeutics.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685265","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.624499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Nickel","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.533581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.49269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Mutagenesis","weight":0.469676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.358737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.318321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.189176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.143256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0437018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Prototype","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
