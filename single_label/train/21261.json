{"id":21261,"title":"High prevalence of closely-related Acinetobacter baumannii in pets according to a multicentre study in veterinary clinics, Reunion Island.","abstract":"Our objective was to study the carriage of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) in pets in Reunion Island (RI), a French territory in Indian Ocean. Overall, 138 pets were sampled (rectum, mouth, wounds if applicable) in 9 veterinary clinics (VC). The prevalence of AB carriage was 6.5% (95%CI; 2.4, 10.6) and 9 carriers were identified from 4 VC. Hospitalization in a VC and antimicrobial treatment administered within the 15 preceding days were significantly associated with AB carriage (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). Despite the VC in which animals have been sampled were located all around RI, most isolates (8/9) were closely-related (>90% similarity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis). Additional studies are needed to improve the understanding about interactions between the different reservoirs of AB in RI.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613079","annotations":[{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Indian Ocean","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"France","weight":0.326262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Reunion Island","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunion_Island"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Acinetobacter baumannii","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter_baumannii"},{"name":"Victoria Cross","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Aircraft carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Pet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet"},{"name":"Rhode Island","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Territory (country subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(country_subdivision)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Ocean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Alberta","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"}]}
