{"id":36586,"title":"Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab for retinopathy of prematurity.","abstract":"To evaluate the outcomes of intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (IVB) for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).IVB was selected to be the first treatment for type 1 ROP in 8 eyes (4 patients). Bevacizumab (0.25 mg/eye) was injected into the vitreous cavity under either general anesthesia or sedation. Fundus photography and fluorescein angiography were performed before the IVB. One infant was observed to the age of 1 year 6 months, the second to 1 year 9 months, the third to 1 year 10 months, and the fourth to 2 years 0 month.Before the IVB, 6 eyes (3 patients) had ROP in zone II and 2 eyes (one patient) had ROP in zone I. The 3 infants with ROP in zone II weighed 652, 476, and 579 g with gestational ages of 24, 27, and 24 weeks at birth, respectively. The infant with ROP in zone I weighed 972 g with a gestational age of 26 weeks at birth. IVB was performed at postmenstrual ages of 33-37 weeks. The IVB was effective in all eyes with ROP in zone II and additional treatment was not required, whereas vitreous hemorrhage and cataract were found at 19 weeks and 5 months after the initial IVB in the two eyes with ROP in zone I. These two eyes required additional IVB, laser photocoagulation, and surgery.Our findings suggest that eyes with type 1 ROP in zone II can be treated with IVB. Further studies are needed with a larger number of eyes.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566819","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.816036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.689735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.667324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.662441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.542106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.532155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Retinopathy of prematurity","weight":0.442693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy_of_prematurity"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.405374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.401005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.3483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.279586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.259143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.195936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.159609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"476","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/476"},{"name":"652","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/652"},{"name":"972","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/972"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Education in Northern Ireland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Northern_Ireland"},{"name":"Life and death","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_and_death"},{"name":"Sixth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_grade"},{"name":"California Association of Regional Occupational Centers and Programs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Association_of_Regional_Occupational_Centers_and_Programs"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Fundus (uterus)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(uterus)"},{"name":"Year Ten","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Ten"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
