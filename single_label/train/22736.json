{"id":22736,"title":"[Impact of an automated rapid MRSA/VRE identification technique in the surveillance of patients transferred from other medical centers].","abstract":"Identification of patients with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) is essential to limit the spread of these agents, through the use of isolation and contact precautions. Traditional microbiology has a long turn around time (3-5 days) extending the time of isolation, increasing complexity and cost of these patients.To implement a new real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) GeneXpert R for SAMR and VRE detection. To compare costs and turn around time of PCR versus traditional cultures.Two periods were compared, in the first, traditional microbiology (standard group) was used, and in the second, only PCR was used (PCR group).MRSA or VRE were identified in 29.9% of patients in the PCR group and in 9.6% in the standard group. Turn around time was 15 ± 9 hours in PCR group and 53 ± 23 hours in standard group. PCR group had a net cost of USD 245 per patient and standard group USD 530 per patient.PCR technique GeneXpert R for MRSA and VRE had a positive impact in the management of these patients and justifies its inclusion.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522305","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.82393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.706187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.49665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.475266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.440823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.417124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.292857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Meticillin","weight":0.0310064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meticillin"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus","weight":0.0255241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin-resistant_Enterococcus"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Forensic identification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Area code 530","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_530"}]}
