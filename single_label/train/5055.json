{"id":5055,"title":"Cementless total hip replacement without femoral osteotomy in patients with severe developmental dysplasia of the hip: minimum 15-year clinical and radiological results.","abstract":"We describe the clinical and radiological results of cementless primary total hip replacement (THR) in 25 patients (18 women and seven men; 30 THRs) with severe developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Their mean age at surgery was 47 years (23 to 89). In all, 21 hips had Crowe type III dysplasia and nine had Crowe type IV. Cementless acetabular components with standard polyethylene liners were introduced as close to the level of the true acetabulum as possible. The modular cementless S-ROM femoral component was used with a low resection of the femoral neck. A total of 21 patients (25 THRs) were available for review at a mean follow-up of 18.7 years (15.8 to 21.8). The mean modified Harris hip score improved from 46 points pre-operatively to 90 at final follow up (p < 0.001). A total of 15 patients (17 THRs; 57%) underwent revision of the acetabular component at a mean of 14.6 years (7 to 20.8), all for osteolysis. Two patients (two THRs) had symptomatic loosening. No patient underwent femoral revision. Survival with revision of either component for any indication was 81% at 15 years (95% CI 60.1 to 92.3), with 21 patients at risk. This technique may reduce the need for femoral osteotomy in severe DDH, while providing a good long-term functional result.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25371455","annotations":[{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.865376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.691498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.690269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.642176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.4389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.418766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.194585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.10801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.0294679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"List of aviation, aerospace and aeronautical abbreviations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aviation,_aerospace_and_aeronautical_abbreviations"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Ocean liner","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_liner"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"}]}
