{"id":83371,"title":"Non-random occurrence of Robertsonian translocations in the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus): is it related to quantitative variation in the minor satellite?","abstract":"The house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, shows extraordinary chromosomal diversity driven by fixation of Robertsonian (Rb) translocations. The high frequency of this rearrangement, which involves the centromeric regions, has been ascribed to the architecture of the satellite sequence (high quantity and homogeneity). This promotes centromere-related translocations through unequal recombination and gene conversion. A characteristic feature of Rb variation in this subspecies is the non-random contribution of different chromosomes to the translocation frequency, which, in turn, depends on the chromosome size. Here, the association between satellite quantity and Rb frequency was tested by PRINS of the minor satellite which is the sequence involved in the translocation breakpoints. Five chromosomes with different translocation frequencies were selected and analyzed among wild house mice from 8 European localities. Using a relative quantitative measurement per chromosome, the analysis detected a large variability in signal size most of which was observed between individuals and/or localities. The chromosomes differed significantly in the quantity of the minor satellite, but these differences were not correlated with their translocation frequency. However, the data uncovered a marginally significant correlation between the quantity of the minor satellite and chromosome size. The implications of these results on the evolution of the chromosomal architecture in the house mouse are discussed.","date":"2014-12-04","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25401386","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.688108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Subspecies","weight":0.68362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.6439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.395781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Gene conversion","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_conversion"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.228444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"House mouse","weight":0.221135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_mouse"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.125893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Robertsonian translocation","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertsonian_translocation"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.082094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0544569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Satellite","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"High frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Fixation (population genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(population_genetics)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Retinoblastoma protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma_protein"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"}]}
