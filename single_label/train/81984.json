{"id":81984,"title":"Food insecurity and dental caries in schoolchildren: a cross-sectional survey in the western Brazilian Amazon.","abstract":"We analyzed the association between food insecurity and dental caries in 7- to 9-yr-old schoolchildren. We performed a cross-sectional survey nested in a population-based cohort study of 203 schoolchildren. The participants lived in the urban area of a small town within the western Brazilian Amazon. Dental examinations were performed according to criteria recommended by the World Health Organization. The number of decayed deciduous and permanent teeth as a count variable was the outcome measure. Socio-economic status, food security, behavioral variables, and child nutritional status, measured by Z-score for body mass index (BMI), were investigated, and robust Poisson regression models were used. The results showed a mean (SD) of 3.63 (3.26) teeth affected by untreated caries. Approximately 80% of schoolchildren had at least one untreated decayed tooth, and nearly 60% lived in food-insecure households. Sex, household wealth index, mother's education level, and food-insecurity scores were associated with dental caries in the crude analysis. Dental caries was 1.5 times more likely to be associated with high food-insecurity scores after adjusting for socio-economic status and sex. A significant dose-response relationship was observed. In conclusion, food insecurity is highly associated with dental caries in 7- to 9-yr-old children and may be seen as a risk factor. These findings suggest that food-security policies could reduce dental caries.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754799","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.915465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.829999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.696382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Food security","weight":0.608119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.569715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.534631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.52625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Wealth","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.419697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.340918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.214446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Security","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Deciduous","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Personal finance","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_finance"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Town","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Amazon.com","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
