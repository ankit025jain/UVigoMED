{"id":89613,"title":"Polyethylene wear and osteolysis is associated with high revision rate of a small sized porous coated THA in patients with hip dysplasia.","abstract":"The outcome of 25 primary THAs in patients with hip dysplasia using the AML Bantam femoral stem (DePuy) is reported. Age at operation averaged 43 ± 10 years. Twenty-two of 25 stems were cementless. All cementless acetabular components had conventional or cross-linked polyethylene and screws. Follow-up averaged 11 ± 5 years (range 4-18). Four cementless stems were revised after 3, 4, 8, and 9 years; 2/3 cemented stems were revised at 8 and 18 years. Femoral revisions demonstrated extensive conventional polyethylene wear, periprosthetic osteolysis and loosening. Five entire cups were revised for wear and loosening; four liners were replaced. Harris Hip Scores for patients with retained stems went from 43 ± 12 to 85 ± 13. High revision rates with the proximally porous coated Bantam stem are due to loss of fixation, often associated with polyethylene wear and osteolysis.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698818","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.402331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.31901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.308715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (canine)","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(canine)"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0829469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Coat (dog)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_(dog)"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ocean liner","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_liner"},{"name":"DePuy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DePuy"}]}
