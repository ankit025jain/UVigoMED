{"id":23749,"title":"Does bacterial infection cause genome instability and cancer in the host cell?","abstract":"Research of the past several decades suggests that bacterial infection can lead to genome instability of the host cell often resulting in cancer development. However, there is still a substantial lack of knowledge regarding possible mechanisms involved in the development of genomic instability. Several questions remain unanswered, namely: Why has the causative relationship between the bacterial infection and cancer been established only for a small number of cancers? What is the mechanism responsible for the induction of genome instability and cancer? Is the infection process required to cause genome instability and cancer? In this review, we present a hypothesis that the bacterial infection, exposure to heat-killed bacteria or even some bacterial determinants may trigger genome instability of exposed and distal cells, and thus may cause cancer. We will discuss the mechanisms of host responses to the bacterial infection and present the possible pathways leading to genome instability and cancer through exposure to bacteria.
