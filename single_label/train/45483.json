{"id":45483,"title":"Adiponutrin: a multimeric plasma protein.","abstract":"The interest in adiponutrin stems from adiponutrin variant I148M, which is strongly associated to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Adiponutrin has to date been considered to be solely an intracellular protein, with a role in lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissue. However, a physiologically relevant role for adiponutrin has not been found. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of adiponutrin in human plasma, a new facet of adiponutrin research. We demonstrate that adiponutrin is present in plasma as disulfide-bond dependent multimers, estimated to circulate at a concentration of 1.25-4 nM. Experiments reveal that adiponutrin is released from HepG2 cells in the presence of oleate. The presence of adiponutrin in plasma makes it accessible for clinical investigations and use as a potential biomarker for metabolic disease.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680680","annotations":[{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Blood proteins","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_proteins"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Oleic acid","weight":0.596945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleic_acid"},{"name":"Oligomer","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomer"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.487823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.333055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Hep G2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hep_G2"},{"name":"Zygapophysial joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygapophysial_joint"}]}
