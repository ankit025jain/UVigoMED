{"id":69583,"title":"GRK3 is essential for metastatic cells and promotes prostate tumor progression.","abstract":"The biochemical mechanisms that regulate the process of cancer metastasis are still poorly understood. Because kinases, and the signaling pathways they comprise, play key roles in regulation of many cellular processes, we used an unbiased RNAi in vitro screen and a focused cDNA in vivo screen against human kinases to identify those with previously undocumented roles in metastasis. We discovered that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3; or ?-adrenergic receptor kinase 2) was not only necessary for survival and proliferation of metastatic cells, but also sufficient to promote primary prostate tumor growth and metastasis upon exogenous expression in poorly metastatic cells in mouse xenograft models. Mechanistically, we found that GRK3 stimulated angiogenesis, at least in part through down-regulation of thrombospondin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2. Furthermore, GRK3 was found to be overexpressed in human prostate cancers, especially in metastatic tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that GRK3 plays an important role in prostate cancer progression and metastasis.
