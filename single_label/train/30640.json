{"id":30640,"title":"[Literature review of application of shenmai injection in special populations (children)].","abstract":"Analyze the characteristic features of Shenmai injections as used in pediatric clinics, to improve the specifications for use in children in order to decrease risks.We preformed statistical analyses on data from the CNKI and VIP databases relevant to the clinical application of Shenmai injections in children. Pediatric indications, usage and dosage, length of treatment, solubility of the drugs in mediums and adverse reactions were summarized.Shenmai injection is widely used in clinical pediatrics, and is reported to show effectivenss for conditions such as viral myocarditis, pneumonia, neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, neonatal scleroderma, diarrhea and other diseases. However, there are no specific specifications regarding usage and dosages, length of treatments, or instructions regarding solvents. Adverse reactions reported include, drug rash, heat, blushing, and chest tightness amongst others.Effective measures should be adopted to standardize the clinical regulations regarding Shenmai injections for use in children, to reduce risks, and thereby raise clinical treatment standards.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471351","annotations":[{"name":"Myocarditis","weight":0.89194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocarditis"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.79151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.743088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Scleroderma","weight":0.708993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleroderma"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.636032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.369202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Cerebral hypoxia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hypoxia"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Flushing (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_(physiology)"},{"name":"Vasoactive intestinal peptide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide"},{"name":"Mediumship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Specification (technical standard)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)"}]}
