{"id":88195,"title":"Hemispheric differences in the surgical outcomes of patients with traumatic acute subdural hematoma.","abstract":"Our assumption that prognosis of patients with traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) does not differ significantly according to the hemispheric laterality has never been verified.A review of the charts/radiographic images of 61 adult traumatic ASDH patients (33 left/28 right) was conducted. Intergroup comparison was made on the demographics, autonomic/laboratory data, and outcomes (90-day mortality rate). Based on the presence of concomitant brain contusion, patients were further quadrichotomized as: left ASDH with contusion (n?=?14), right ASDH with contusion (n?=?16), left ASDH without contusion (n?=?19), and right ASDH without contusion (n?=?12). Comparisons were made on demographic and outcome variables between the left ASDH with contusion and right ASDH with contusion, and between the left ASDH without contusion and right ASDH without contusion. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to identify clinical variables correlated with fatality.There were no significant differences in the demographic, autonomic, and laboratory data between the left and right ASDH patients. However, 90-day mortality rate was significantly higher in the left ASDH patients when concomitant contusion was present (79% vs. 25%, p?=?0.009). However, there were no significant hemispheric differences in the mortality rate among those without contusion (32% vs. 33%, p?=?0.77). Multivariate regression analysis showed that left ASDH was correlated with fatality among those with contusion (OR: 6.620; 95% CI: 1.219-46.249).This study is probably the first to report that the left ASDH patients fared substantially worse than the right-sided counterparts. Future trials on traumatic ASDHs may benefit from considering hemispheric differences in the outcomes.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886328","annotations":[{"name":"Subdural hematoma","weight":0.879079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdural_hematoma"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.741585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.558927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.541068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.401669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.396944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"General linear model","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_model"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cerebral contusion","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_contusion"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.0624174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Laterality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laterality"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"249","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/249"},{"name":"Cerebral hemisphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"},{"name":"Intergroups in the European Parliament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergroups_in_the_European_Parliament"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
