{"id":21954,"title":"[Quality of life of leprosy patients' group in Vietnam].","abstract":"Vietnam has achieved WHO's leprosy elimination goal at a national level, but there are a lot ofex-leprosy patients who have severe physical disabilities in the leprosy treatment centers and resettlement villages. The purpose of this study is to analyze the quality of life (QOL) of ex-leprosy patients in Vietnam. The study was conducted in two leprosy treatment centers in Vietnam. The SF-36v2 QOL survey was used to evaluate the leprosy patients' health related conditions, and as a comparison group, SF-36v2 QOL survey was provided to a random group from the general population to measure the general groups' health related conditions. For those participants aged from 10 to 29 years old, the patients' group scored lower than the general group in each of the following categories; Role physical, Bodily pain, General health perceptions, Vitality, Social functioning, Role emotional. On the other hand, middle aged and elderly participants were found to show no significant difference between the patients' group and the general group. In comparing the two leprosy treatment centers, the score of Role physical and Role emotional were significantly higher in the leprosy treatment center where vocational training programs for leprosy patients are offered. From these results, the use of vocational training program is one of the effective methods for improving the QOL of the patients' group.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579455","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.810373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Vietnam","weight":0.4316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.328885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.14962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Vocational education","weight":0.116989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.100392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Effective results in number theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_results_in_number_theory"},{"name":"Health (gaming)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_(gaming)"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Middle age","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_age"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"}]}
