{"id":43114,"title":"[Research of conjugated bile acids in gallbladder bile of patients with polypoid lesions of gallbladder].","abstract":"To investigate the difference in conjugated bile acids in the gallbladder bile between gallbladder cholesterol polyps and adenomatous polyps patients, and screen the differential diagnosis-markers for polypoid lesions of gallbladder (PLG).From January to June 2013, the 20 cholesterol polyps patients, 10 adenomatous polyps patients and 10 patients without gallbladder diseases were enrolled. High performance liquid chromatography assay with ultraviolet detection was used to test 8 conjugated bile acids in gallbladder bile.The 8 conjugated bile acids were completely analyzed in 10 minutes, and the assay was liner in the range 8-500 µg/ml. The correlation coeffients for linear regression was from 0.9996-0.9999 and the detection limits ranged from 3.90-7.81 µg/ml. The level of taurocholic acid (TCA) in adenomatous polyps group ((75 ± 51) µg/ml) was significantly lower than that in the cholesterol polyps ((228 ± 206) µg/ml, q = 3.120, P = 0.014) and control groups ((104 ± 40) µg/ml, q = 2.950, P = 0.027). The level of taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) in cholesterol polyps group ((604 ± 444) µg/ml) was significantly higher than that in the adenomatous polyps ((310 ± 182) µg/ml, q = 2.560, P = 0.048) and control groups ((308 ± 21) µg/ml, q = 2.970, P = 0.023).The levels of TCA and TCDCA in the gallbladder biles in cholesterol polyps patients were higher than those in adenomatous polyps patients, which may be the differential diagnosis-markers for PLG.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Digestive System
