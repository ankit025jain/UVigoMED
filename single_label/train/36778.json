{"id":36778,"title":"Ring chromosome 9 in a newborn.","abstract":"Ring chromosome 9 in a newborn: Ring chromosome 9 is a rare genetic disorder observed in the children with variable clinical presentation and phenotype. Among several ring formation, individuals with r(9) generally have less distinct clinical features. We examined in a newborn patient with trigonocephaly, upward-slanting palpebral fissures, small face, micrognathia, high arched palate, low set ears, hypertrichosis and broad eyebrows, short neck and we diagnosed this patient as ring chromosome 9 by chromosomal analysis. We compared the clinical findings of our cases with previously reported patients in the literature.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551976","annotations":[{"name":"Micrognathism","weight":0.91782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrognathism"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Marfan syndrome","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.686344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Chromosome 9 (human)","weight":0.57891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_9_(human)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Palpebral fissure","weight":0.526917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpebral_fissure"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.337377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0623561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Trigonocephaly","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonocephaly"},{"name":"Hypertrichosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrichosis"},{"name":"Ring chromosome","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_chromosome"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Eyebrow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyebrow"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Fissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
