{"id":80039,"title":"[Evaluation of an indirect immunofluorescence assay kit for the detection of anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgG].","abstract":"To develop an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) kit for detecting anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgG.Based on the established IFA method, we established an IFA kit for the detection of human T. gondii infection. The optimal working concentrations of T. gondii IgG-positive human serum and FITC-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody were determined. Sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and storage period of this kit were studied, and compared with an imported kit.The optimal working concentration of T. gondii IgG-positive human serum and FITC-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody was 1:40 and 1:100, respectively. The maximum dilution of T. gondii IgG-positive human serum that the kit can detect was 1:640. No cross reaction was observed with sera from patients with vivax malaria, falciparum malaria, schistosomiasis, echinococcosis, or cysticercosis. Cross reaction was observed to the rheumatoid factor positive sera. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, concordance, Youden index of this kit was 90.9%, 100%, 100%, 96.2%, 97.2%, and 0.91, respectively; and that of the imported kit was 100%, 98%, 95.7%, 100%, 98.6%, and 0.98, respectively. There was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between the two kits (P > 0.05).The IFA kit shows adequate sensitivity and specificity for detection of anti-T. gondii IgG.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818387","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.880638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.806321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.79019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.749649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Rheumatoid factor","weight":0.688657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_factor"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.649292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.5764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Cysticercosis","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysticercosis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"640","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/640"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Misanthropy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Irish Football Association","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Football_Association"},{"name":"Concordance (genetics)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_(genetics)"}]}
