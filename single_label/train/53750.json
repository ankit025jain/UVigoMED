{"id":53750,"title":"Multiple functional ingredient approach in formulating dietary supplement for management of diabetes: a review.","abstract":"Food and nutrition science has moved from identifying and correcting nutritional deficiencies to designing foods that promote optimal health and reduce the risk of disease. Diabetes is rapidly emerging as a pandemic. It is also accompanied by several health implications viz. cardiovascular diseases, obesity, hypertension, cancer, depression, and eating disorders. International Diabetes Federation estimates that in 2010, India is home to 50.8 million diabetics and the number is expected to go up to a whopping 87 million by 2030. The primary goal of medical nutrition therapy was to design special dietary products for patients with hyperglycemia, intended in controlling postprandial plasma glucose fluctuations and hypercholesterolemic tendencies. However, an effective way to minimize these health risks could be through modifications in the diet by inclusion of multiple functional ingredients, aimed for their concerted role in management of individuals suffering with diabetes.
