{"id":45766,"title":"The efficacy and morbidity of different surgical treatment techniques for chronic anal fissure: an academic colorectal experience.","abstract":"Up to 40 per cent of chronic fissures will fail to heal with medical treatment alone. Open (OLIS) and closed (CLIS) lateral internal sphincterotomies are considered by many to be the treatment of choice for chronic anal fissures (CAF). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and clinical outcomes of different surgical techniques for treatment of CAF. We performed a retrospective chart review of 387 patients with CAF who underwent surgical intervention performed by colorectal surgeons between 2006 and 2012 at Greenville Hospital System. Of 387 patients, 199 underwent OLIS, 124 CLIS, and 64 patients underwent fissurectomy alone (FE). We investigated the effect of the surgical technique on time of healing, rate of flatus incontinence, wound infection, recurrence, and the need for additional intervention. There was no statistically significant difference among patients undergoing OLIS, CLIS, and FE in demographic characteristic, time of healing, rate of wound infections, and fecal continence, or recurrence rate. Comparison of a combined lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) group with FE showed that there is similar time of healing (P = 0.58), no statistical difference in flatus incontinence rate (P = 0.61), urinary retention (P = 1.0), fissure recurrence (P = 0.11), and prolonged healing (P = 0.2). Patients in FE group more likely required additional treatment to complete wound healing (P = 0.02). LIS is a safe and effective technique for treatment of CAF. Although there was no difference in complications rate and healing time, patients in the FE group required additional surgical or medical treatment more frequently to achieve complete healing.
