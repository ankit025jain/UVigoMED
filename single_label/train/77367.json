{"id":77367,"title":"Increasing trend of sensitization to Methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI).","abstract":"Recent reports have shown increased sensitization to Methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone. We report a retrospective study conducted at the Hospital das Cl√≠nicas--UFMG, based on the results of patch tests with the Brazilian standard series, performed on referred patients. The positive results in 359 patients from November 2009 to October 2012 were analyzed and compared with the previous data collected from March 2006 to October 2009 (447 patients). The data showed 11.14% sensitization to Methylchloroisothiazolinone/ methylisothiazolinone during 2009-2012, contrasting with the previous period (3.35%). A positive association was found between its positivity and the period of 2009-2012.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937839","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Methylisothiazolinone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylisothiazolinone"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"359","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/359"},{"name":"Methylchloroisothiazolinone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylchloroisothiazolinone"},{"name":"Patch (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Period 1 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_1_element"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Sensitization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
