{"id":65450,"title":"Comparative effectiveness of aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment among men with early-stage prostate cancer and differing comorbid disease burdens at diagnosis.","abstract":"This study sought to compare the effectiveness of aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment in reducing cancer-specific mortality for older men with early-stage prostate cancer across differing comorbid disease burdens at diagnosis.In total, the authors sampled 140,553 men aged ? 66 years with early-stage prostate cancer who were diagnosed between 1991 and 2007 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. Propensity-adjusted competing-risks regression analysis was used to compare the risk of cancer-specific mortality between men who received aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment among comorbidity subgroups.In propensity-adjusted competing-risks regression analysis, aggressive treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of cancer-specific mortality among men who had Charlson scores of 0, 1, and 2 but not among men who had Charlson scores ? 3 (subhazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-1.18). The absolute reduction in 15-year cancer-specific mortality between men who received aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment was 6.1%, 4.3%, 3.9%, and 0.9% for men with Charlson scores of 0, 1, 2, and ? 3, respectively. Among men who had well-differentiated and moderately-differentiated tumors, aggressive treatment again was associated with a lower risk of cancer-specific mortality for those who had Charlson scores of 0, 1, and 2 but not for those who had Charlson scores ? 3 (subhazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-1.89). The absolute reduction in 15-year cancer-specific mortality between men who received aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment was 3.8%, 3%, 1.9%, and -0.5% for men with Charlson scores of 0, 1, 2, and ? 3, respectively.The cancer-specific survival benefit from aggressive treatment for early-stage prostate cancer diminishes with increasing comorbidity at diagnosis. Men with Charlson scores ? 3 garner no survival benefit from aggressive treatment.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824511","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.900351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.69026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.63899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.633495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.49659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.424648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.355374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.240727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.20626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.119821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0643303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"1991","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991"},{"name":"553","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/553"},{"name":"701","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/701"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
