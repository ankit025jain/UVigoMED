{"id":45086,"title":"Using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MR imaging to predict lipiodol uptake in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma following transcatheter arterial chemoembolization: a preliminary result.","abstract":"To assess the usefulness of intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) for predicting lipiodol uptake in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).The institutional review board approved this study. 44 HCC patients underwent IVIM-DWI and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI prior to TACE. Using post-TACE CT as a reference standard, each HCC was classified into either lipiodol good uptake (LGU) or poor uptake (LPU) group. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) in HCC were calculated. Arterial enhancement ratio (AER) and IVIM parameters were compared between those two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test.Of the 51 HCCs, 37 (72.5%) were LGU group and 14 (27.5%) were LPU group. AER of HCC was significantly higher in LGU than LPU (0.99±0.54 and 0.67±0.45; P=.034). ADC, D, and f values were not significantly different (P=.073, .059, and .196, respectively) between these two groups. D* was significantly elevated in LGU than LPU (48.10±15.33 and 26.75±9.55; P=.001).Both AER derived from contrast enhanced MRI and D* values derived from IVIM-DWI for HCC were significantly higher in LGU than in LPU. These parameters would be helpful for predicting the lipiodol uptake.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703575","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.773455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.706266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.70277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.485982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.110935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Lipiodol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipiodol"},{"name":"Mass diffusivity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_diffusivity"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"759","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/759"},{"name":"1015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1015"},{"name":"670","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/670"},{"name":"990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/990"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Local government","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Iron sight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_sight"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Drug reference standard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_reference_standard"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Linkin Park discography","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park_discography"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Advanced Engine Research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Engine_Research"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
