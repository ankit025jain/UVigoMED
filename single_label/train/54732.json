Four Cochrane documents addressing treatments for dry eye were obtained from the Cochran Database, but two are still in the protocol phase and two reviews offer limited evidence for the efficacy and safety for punctal occlusion and AS serum eye drops.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195334","annotations":[{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.150838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0783418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"}]}
