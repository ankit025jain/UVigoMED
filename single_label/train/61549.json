{"id":61549,"title":"Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells in IgG4-related lymphadenopathy with comparison with extranodal IgG4-related disease.","abstract":"IgG4-related lymphadenopathy with increased numbers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells has been reported but not fully described. We analyzed 31 cases of IgG4-related lymphadenopathy and 24 cases of extranodal IgG4-related diseases for their possible relationship with EBV. Other types of reactive lymph nodes (22) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) (10) were also studied for comparison. EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization revealed EBER(+) cells in 18 of 31 cases (58%) of IgG4-related lymphadenopathy. Increased EBER(+) cells were found in only 4 of 22 (18.1%) non-IgG4-related reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in patients of a similar age (P=0.002) and in only 5 of 24 (21%) extranodal IgG4-related biopsies (P=0.006). Interestingly, all patients with EBER(+) progressively transformed germinal center-type IgG4-related lymphadenopathy had systemic lymphadenopathy and/or extranodal involvement. AITL also is associated with EBV, and IgG4-related lymphadenopathy sometimes mimics the morphology of AITL; however, the number of IgG4(+) cells in AITL was significantly less than that in IgG4-related lymphadenopathy (P<0.001). Increased numbers of regulatory T cells are seen in IgG4-related disease; however, there was not a significant difference between the EBER(+) and EBER(-) cases. In conclusion, the presence of increased numbers of EBV-infected cells in IgG4-related lymphadenopathy, compared with other reactive lymphadenopathy or extranodal IgG4-related disease, suggests that there may be a relationship at least between nodal IgG4-related disease and EBV. It is important to avoid overdiagnosing these cases as malignant lymphomas or EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705309","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.73345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.71083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.516675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Epstein-Barr virus","weight":0.51107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein-Barr_virus"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.40308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.387637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
