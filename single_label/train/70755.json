{"id":70755,"title":"Leiomyosarcoma of the spermatic cord with scalp metastasis: case report and literature review.","abstract":"Herein we present 82-year-old man with leiomyosarcoma arising from the spermatic cord with scalp metastasis, five years after primary surgical treatment. Complete surgical excision is required in such cases, as well as precise evaluation of further therapy. Paratesticular leiomyosarcoma is a rare entity, malignant mesenchimal tumor of smooth muscle differentiation. Although leiomyosarcomas of different localizations have well-known metastatic potential, cutaneous metastases are extremely rare with only 16 cases described in the literature. To our knowledge there are no reported cases of the paratesticular leiomyosarcoma metastatic to the skin. This article reviews the literature regarding paratesticular leiomyosarcoma presentation, diagnosis and treatment.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145020","annotations":[{"name":"Leiomyosarcoma","weight":0.833031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyosarcoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Spermatic cord","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatic_cord"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Testicular cancer","weight":0.580657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_cancer"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.510662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.338398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.311145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0303278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Reference counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Localization of a ring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_ring"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Spermatic plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatic_plexus"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Myogenesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myogenesis"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
