{"id":13424,"title":"Risk factors for transfusion-associated complications and nonsurvival in dogs receiving packed red blood cell transfusions: 211 cases (2008-2011).","abstract":"To determine whether the number, volume, or age of transfused packed RBC units; volume of other blood products; or pretransfusion PCV was a risk factor for transfusion-associated complications or nonsurvival in dogs.Retrospective case series.211 client-owned dogs receiving stored packed RBC transfusions.Information collected or calculated from the medical record of each dog included the total number, volume, and dose of packed RBC units; mean age of packed RBC units; number of packed RBC units > 14 days old; age of oldest packed RBC unit; volume and dose of other blood products used; pretransfusion PCV; acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation score; transfusion-associated complications; and outcome.The dose (mL/kg) of other blood products transfused was a risk factor for transfusion-associated complications (OR, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.05). The pretransfusion PCV (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.21) and dose of packed RBCs administered (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.07) were risk factors for nonsurvival. Age of transfused packed RBC units was not identified as a risk factor for transfusion-associated complications or nonsurvival, but the study was statistically underpowered to detect this finding.Administration of larger doses of other non-packed RBC blood products was a risk factor for transfusion-associated complications, and a higher pretransfusion PCV and larger dose of packed RBCs administered were risk factors for nonsurvival. Prospective randomized studies are needed to determine whether conservative transfusion strategies will reduce transfusion-associated complications and improve outcome in dogs.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479457","annotations":[{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.903101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.848952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.668355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Statistical power","weight":0.62245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.454724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.449287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.447351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.35386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.3165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Packed red blood cells","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_red_blood_cells"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
