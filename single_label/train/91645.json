{"id":91645,"title":"Modeling of femoral neck cortical bone for the numerical simulation of ultrasound propagation.","abstract":"Quantitative ultrasound assessment of the cortical compartment of the femur neck (FN) is investigated with the goal of achieving enhanced fracture risk prediction. Measurements at the FN are influenced by bone size, shape and material properties. The work described here was aimed at determining which FN material properties have a significant impact on ultrasound propagation around 0.5 MHz and assessing the relevancy of different models. A methodology for the modeling of ultrasound propagation in the FN, with a focus on the modeling of bone elastic properties based on scanning acoustic microscopy data, is introduced. It is found that the first-arriving ultrasound signal measured in through-transmission at the FN is not influenced by trabecular bone properties or by the heterogeneities of the cortical bone mineralized matrix. In contrast, the signal is sensitive to variations in cortical porosity, which can, to a certain extent, be accounted for by effective properties calculated with the Mori-Tanaka method.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486239","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.752993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.590028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.508514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.481978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.445539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.259824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Numerical analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Elastic modulus","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus"},{"name":"Wave propagation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_propagation"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Signal processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Variation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_(music)"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"List of materials properties","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_materials_properties"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Biomineralization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomineralization"},{"name":"Predictive analytics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics"}]}
