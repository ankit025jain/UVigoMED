{"id":63058,"title":"The comprehensive clinical management of multiple myeloma and related-plasma cell disorders.","abstract":"Whilst we think of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders as incurable to date, never before has there been such hope and enthusiasm about advances in the research and treatment of these various diseases. Translational research is very much at the forefront of progress for further refining targeted therapies and continuing to improve clinical efficacy. Whilst some of these advances in the last decade have been truly dramatic in their scope and timing, it is also worth noting that relatively incremental changes have favorably impacted on patient outcome, and this comprehensive clinical management review captures these accordingly. We hope therefore that this concise overview will give readers, be they specialist hemato-oncologists, or other providers and researchers in the field, an enlightening insight into the exciting future of therapeutic opportunities, as well as a practical 'hands on' approach.
