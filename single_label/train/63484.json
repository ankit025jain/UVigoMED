{"id":63484,"title":"Effect of hyperthyroidism on the hypercoagulable state and thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation.","abstract":"To clarify whether hyperthyroidism (HT) itself confers an additional effect on the hypercoagulable state and the risk of ischemic stroke among patients with hyperthyroid atrial fibrillation (AF).We prospectively evaluated plasma D-dimer levels and thromboembolic events among three groups of patients (hyperthyroid AF, n = 62; nonthyroid AF, n = 107, and HT without AF, n = 100). Plasma D-dimer levels were used to evaluate the hypercoagulable state.The D-dimer level was significantly higher in patients with hyperthyroid AF than in nonthyroid AF (0.66 ± 0.06 vs. 0.34 ± 0.02 mg/l, p < 0.001) and HT without AF (0.66 ± 0.06 vs. 0.27 ± 0.02 mg/l, p < 0.001). During a 3-year follow-up, patients with hyperthyroid AF had a significantly higher incidence of ischemic stroke compared with patients with nonthyroid AF (hazard ratio, HR: 3.2, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.01-5.59, p = 0.04). Cox regression analysis revealed that age (HR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21, p = 0.05), CHADS2-VAS score (HR: 5.5, 95% CI: 1.51-7.43, p = 0.01) and anticoagulation (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.07-0.54, p = 0.01) were independent predictors of risk for the occurrence of ischemic stroke.The present study suggests that HT may enhance the hypercoagulable state and the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with AF.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434544","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.639338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.623756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.385633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.28232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Atrial fibrillation","weight":0.269636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Hyperthyroidism","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0958331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.0291129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"CHADS2 score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHADS2_score"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Ventricular fibrillation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation"}]}
