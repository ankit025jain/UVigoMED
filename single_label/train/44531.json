{"id":44531,"title":"[Antireflux surgery more cost-effective than medication after all?].","abstract":"Although fundoplication has been found effective in the treatment of reflux disease, its long-term results have raised doubts due to the large number of patients taking acid blocker medication after the operation. Based on the five-year follow-up of the REFLUX study, reflux symptoms and quality of life associated with reflux were improved after the operation. Laparoscopic fundoplication was found to be a cost-effective form of treatment among those having a chronic reflux disease. The operation can be recommended for treating reflux disease in patients exhibiting a non-optimal PPI drug response.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730198","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.362103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.355673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.101738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Attachment therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_therapy"},{"name":"Nissen fundoplication","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissen_fundoplication"}]}
