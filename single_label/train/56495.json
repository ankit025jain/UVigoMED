{"id":56495,"title":"Autocrine impact of VEGF-A on uveal melanoma cells.","abstract":"Tumor-derived VEGF-A, apart from expediting sufficient vascularization, subsequent tumor growth, and metastatic spread, can act on malignant cells themselves provided that VEGF receptors 1 or 2 (VEGF-R1, -R2) are co-expressed. The study goal was to investigate whether such autocrine VEGF-A signaling exists in uveal melanoma (UM).Primary (MEL-270, OM-431) and metastatic (OMM-2.3, OMM-2.5) UM cell lines were analyzed for VEGF-A, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R2 expression by RT-PCR, ELISA (VEGF-A protein), and immunocytochemistry (VEGF receptors). Proliferation of UM cells incubated with neutralizing anti-VEGF-A antibody bevacizumab (? 2.5 mg/mL), or VEGF-A (? 100 ng/mL) was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) ELISA. It was measured by real-time PCR, whether VEGF-A (100 ng/mL) modulated the expression ratio of VEGF-A itself and its antiangiogenic antagonist pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF).All UM cells expressed VEGF-A, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2 mRNA, and protein. In each cell line, the proliferation was stimulated by VEGF-A or inhibited by blocking VEGF-A, or both: bevacizumab significantly decreased the proliferation in MEL-270 (P = 0.005), OMM-2.3 (P = 0.001), and OMM-2.5 (P = 0.011). Increased VEGF-A signaling significantly raised the proliferation in MEL-270, OM-431 (P < 0.001, respectively), and OMM-2.3 (P = 0.043) in a dose-dependent manner but did not significantly change the VEGF-A/PEDF mRNA expression ratio.Autocrine VEGF-A signaling seems to be present in UM, sustaining the proliferation of both primary and metastatic UM cells. Apparently, VEGF-A signaling in UM cells neither acts retroactively on VEGF-A expression, in the sense of a feedback loop, nor contributes to a pro-angiogenic shift of the VEGF-A/PEDF ratio.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24677103","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Bromodeoxyuridine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromodeoxyuridine"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.862549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Uveal melanoma","weight":0.784336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveal_melanoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.751649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.627802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.608277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.60383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Autocrine signalling","weight":0.542974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocrine_signalling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"FLT1","weight":0.481866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLT1"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.439265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Kinase insert domain receptor","weight":0.430368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase_insert_domain_receptor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.3922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.358625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.229457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Immunocytochemistry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocytochemistry"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Uvea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvea"},{"name":"Turn (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"}]}
