{"id":85941,"title":"Dickkopf-1 is a novel prognostic biomarker for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is a novel prognostic biomarker for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). DKK1 may be a promising strategy for the future treatment of LSCC metastasis and recurrence.DKK1 is reportedly involved in the metastasis and invasion of several tumor types. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of DKK1 in LSCC.DKK1 expression was measured in Hep-2 cell lines, as well as in tumor and peritumoral tissues, using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analyses. The role of DKK1 in LSCC was investigated by depleting DKK1 using small interfering RNAs. Tissue microarrays of 102 LSCC patient samples were employed to immunohistochemically detect expression of DKK1, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), and ?-catenin. Prognostic significance was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates.DKK1 expression was elevated in the Hep-2 cell line and tumor samples. DKK1 depletion decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness. High DKK1 expression was significantly associated with T and clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size (p < 0.05). Increased DKK1 levels in LSCC tissues correlated with elevated VEGF-C and ?-catenin. Multivariate analyses revealed that DKK1 was an unfavorable predictor of overall survival.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834937","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.700939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.638165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.379702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.358494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.181638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
