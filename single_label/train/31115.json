{"id":31115,"title":"Characterization of and protection from neurotoxicity induced by oxaliplatin, bortezomib and epothilone-B.","abstract":"To characterize neurotoxicity induced by oxaliplatin, bortezomib, and epothilone-B as well as protection against their neurotoxicity using an in vitro model.Neurotoxicity was evaluated using the neurite outgrowth method in PC12 rat pheochromo-cytoma cells differentiated towards a mature neuronal phenotype, while neuroprotection was explored by simultaneous exposure to 0.5 mM amifostine. The potential markers of neuronal differentiation, cyclin-B2 (Ccnb2) and baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 (Birc5), were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Bortezomib, epothilone-B, and oxaliplatin reduced neurite length to 68%, 78% and 66%, respectively (p<0.05). The percentage of neurite-forming-cells (discriminating neurotoxicity from general cytotoxicity) decreased from 70% (control) to 55% (bortezomib), 46% (epothilone-B), and 51% (oxaliplatin). Amifostine was neuroprotective against oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity, increasing both neurite length and neurite-forming-cells. Quantitative-RT-PCR showed a 2.7-fold decrease in Ccnb2 expression in differentiated PC12 vs. undifferentiated cells.Oxaliplatin, bortezomib, and epothilone-B are neurotoxic in the PC12 model. Amifostine has a neuroprotective effect only against oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting that these compounds have different mechanisms of neurotoxicity.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403510","annotations":[{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.860887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.818326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.716905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.634572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.503889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.503681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.503658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.441692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.42438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Neurite","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurite"},{"name":"Reverse transcription","weight":0.308238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.274121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.268363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Amifostine","weight":0.168992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amifostine"},{"name":"PC12 cell","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC12_cell"},{"name":"Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Inhibitor of apoptosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitor_of_apoptosis"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Baculovirus","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baculovirus"}]}
