{"id":89539,"title":"Occupational fall injuries presenting to the emergency department.","abstract":"This study was performed to evaluate occupational and fall injuries presenting to the ED, the risk factors associated with falls among all occupational injuries, and factors affecting prognosis.Data from ED-based Occupational Injury Surveillance System were analysed to investigate the occupational injuries. The 2147 occupational injury subjects were divided into two groups: fall (n?=?213, 9.9%) and non-fall (n?=?1934, 90.1%). Data including baseline and clinical characteristics were compared between the groups.The mean age was older in the fall group (46 vs 42 years old). The rate of construction site-related injury was 32% in the fall group and only 8% in the non-fall group. Injury occurrence during regular working hours (09.00 hours to 18.00 hours) was 70% in the fall group and 57% in the non-fall group. Injury severity using the Excess Mortality Ratio-adjusted Injury Severity Score (EMR-ISS) was more severe in the fall group than in the non-fall group, and days away from work were longer in the fall group than the non-fall group. Older age, compared with an age <29 years old and presence in a construction area during regular working hours were factors associated with fall injuries. Factors affecting prolonged absence for work were older age, higher EMR-ISS, fall injury and poor workplace environmental conditions.Risk factors associated with fall-related occupational injuries include older age and being at a construction area during regular working hours. Falls among occupational injuries are more severe than other injuries and result in longer work loss.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708010","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.746275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.696205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.673504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.655648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Falling (accident)","weight":0.443838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_(accident)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.133181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.131569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Occupational injury","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_injury"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Working time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time"},{"name":"2140s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2140s"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
