{"id":73984,"title":"Simulating vertical and horizontal inhibition with short-term dynamics in a multi-column multi-layer model of neocortex.","abstract":"The paper introduces a multi-layer multi-column model of the cortex that uses four different neuron types and short-term plasticity dynamics. It was designed with details of neuronal connectivity available in the literature and meets these conditions: (1) biologically accurate laminar and columnar flows of activity, (2) normal function of low-threshold spiking and fast spiking neurons, and (3) ability to generate different stages of epileptiform activity. With these characteristics the model allows for modeling lesioned or malformed cortex, i.e. examine properties of developmentally malformed cortex in which the balance between inhibitory neuron subtypes is disturbed.
