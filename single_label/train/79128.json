{"id":79128,"title":"Periodic botulinum toxin injections for paradoxical vocal fold motion in a child with cerebral palsy: a case study.","abstract":"We describe an unusual case of paradoxical vocal fold motion in a child with cerebral palsy. Clinically, the child presented with mild stridor, which worsened over months, eventually requiring emergency intubation. After an unsuccessful trial of medical management, microlaryngoscopy revealed abnormal adduction of the vocal folds during inspiration. This was successfully treated with periodic type A botulinum toxin injections to the vocal folds, sparing the child from tracheostomy.
