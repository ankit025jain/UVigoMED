{"id":30957,"title":"[Investigation of risk factors of cardiovascular events by the interregional assistance fund of relatives of stroke patients].","abstract":"We have analyzed the results of the clinical and laboratory study of 1070 people in 7 regions of the Russian Federation, including 222 (20.7%) men and 848 (79.3%) women aged from 19 to 94 years (mean age 57.15Â±13.39 years). It has been shown that 6.8% were smokers and 31.5% were alcohol abusers. Regular physical training (>30 min/day) was noted in 45.7%. Symptoms of asthenia were found in 73.3%. The level of knowledge on risk factors of stroke was estimated as: arterial hypertension (68.6%), ischemic heart disease (47.5%), heart rhythm disorders (27.0%), thrombosis of low extremities (26.8%). Mean values of arterial pressure were 140/80 mm Hg, heartbeat rate -- 74 per min. Mean value of BMI was 28.67 kg/m(2), BMI was higher than 30 in 41%. Hyperglycemia >6.2 mmol/l was recorded in 28%, hypercholesterolemia >6.2 mmol/l in 26%. Stenoses of inner carotid arteries were found in 49.2%: less than 50% diameter stenosis was in 32.8%, 50--70% in 11.8% and >70% in 4.6%. Antihypertensive drugs were used by 66.8%, antiaggregants - by 31.2% and statins by 31.2%. Knowledge about stroke was demonstrated by 81.8%, about stroke symptoms -- 58.5%, about the appropriate actions to be taken in the case of a stroke -- 48.5%. The low risk of stroke was observed in 33.2%, moderate risk in 37.3%, high-risk in 24.6% and critical risk in 4.9%.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24430046","annotations":[{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Ischaemic heart disease","weight":0.854079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischaemic_heart_disease"},{"name":"Hypercholesterolemia","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.82545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.810198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.715333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.604378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.600903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Russia","weight":0.582073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cardiac cycle","weight":0.335569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_cycle"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.317666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.145234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Sinus rhythm","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_rhythm"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"}]}
