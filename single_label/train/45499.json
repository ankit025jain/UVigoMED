{"id":45499,"title":"Colonoscopic perforation management by laparoendoscopy: an algorithm.","abstract":"The role of laparoscopy in the management of iatrogenic colonoscopic injuries has increased with surgeons becoming facile with minimally invasive methods. However, with a limited number of reported cases of successful laparoscopic repair, the exact role of this modality is still being defined. Drawing from previous literature and our own experiences, we have formulated a simple algorithm that has helped us treat colonoscopic perforations.A retrospective review was undertaken of patients treated for colonoscopic perforations since the algorithm's introduction. For each patient, initial clinical assessment, management, and postoperative recovery were carefully documented. A Medline search was performed, incorporating the following search words: colonoscopy, perforation, and laparoscopy. Twenty-three articles involving 106 patients were identified and reviewed.Between May 2009 and August 2012, 7 consecutive patients with colonoscopic perforations were managed by 2 surgeons using the algorithm. There were no complications and no deaths, with a mean length of stay of 4.43 days (range, 2-7 days). Of the 7 patients, 6 required surgery. A single patient was managed conservatively and later underwent an elective colon resection.Traditionally, laparotomy was the preferred method for treating colonoscopic perforations. Our initial experience reinforces previous views that laparoendoscopic surgery is a safe and effective alternative to traditional surgery for managing this complication. We have formulated a simple algorithm that we have found helpful for surgeons considering a laparoscopic approach to managing this condition.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680138","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.795841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.574945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.543806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.490737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.319691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.231498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Randomness extractor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_extractor"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"}]}
