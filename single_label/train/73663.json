{"id":73663,"title":"Photocarcinogenesis: an epidemiologic perspective on ultraviolet light and skin cancer.","abstract":"Photocarcinogenesis is the result of a complex interplay between ultraviolet radiation, DNA damage, mutation formation, DNA repair, apoptosis, and the immune system. Recent trends show an increase in incidence of both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Some individuals have a genetic predisposition toward increased risk for skin cancer, whereas others experience increased risk through ultraviolet exposure and subsequent mutation formation. The initiation and propagation pathways of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers differ but have some elements in common. The increase in incidence of skin cancer has been discovered to vary among age groups and gender.
