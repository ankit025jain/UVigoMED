{"id":60662,"title":"Darbepoetin alfa administered once every three weeks for the treatment of anemia in elderly patients with non-myeloid tumors receiving chemotherapy.","abstract":"The present study aims to describe the hematological response to darbepoetin alfa (DA) under daily clinical practice conditions in anemic elderly patients with non-myeloid tumors receiving chemotherapy.This was a prospective, observational, multicenter study in elderly (?65 years) patients with non-myeloid cancer receiving DA (500 ?g every 3 weeks) for chemotherapy-induced anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] level ?11.0 g/dL).A total of 102 anemic patients with solid tumors and 51 with hematological malignancies were included in 28 centers in Spain. Mean age (±SD) was 73.4 (±5.8) years, and mean baseline Hb level was 10.0 (±0.8) g/dL. DA was administered for a median of 8 weeks. Of the 115 subjects with a post-baseline Hb value, the percentage of patients who achieved a hematopoietic response (Hb increase ?2 g/dL or reaching ?12 g/dL without transfusions in the previous 28 days) was 69.7% (95% CI 56.1% to 83.3%). Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue subscale scores increased during the study (median change 1.0 [Q1 -5.0, Q3 9.0], P = 0.04). One patient (0.7%) experienced a non-serious adverse reaction (cutaneous rash).The study results suggest that DA is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in elderly patients.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852870","annotations":[{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.828943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.589453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.580601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Darbepoetin alfa","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbepoetin_alfa"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Q3","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q3"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"English rugby union system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_rugby_union_system"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
