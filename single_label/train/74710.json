{"id":74710,"title":"Racial differences in the prevalence of restless legs syndrome in a primary care setting.","abstract":"To assess the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in a primary care clinic and in African American (AA) and non-African American (NAA) racial groups.We examined the prevalence of RLS using 1-on-1 interviews in general medicine clinics. Subjects were interviewed using John Hopkins Telephone Diagnostic Interview. All interviews were conducted by trained physicians.A total of 190 patients were interviewed: 103 AA (58.3% were female) and 87 NAA (59.8% were female). The overall prevalence of definite RLS was 22.6%. The average age was 53 years (standard deviation, 15) in AA and 50 years (standard deviation, 13) in NAA. Among AA, the diagnosis of RLS was definite in 11.65%, probable in 3.88%, negative in 83.5%, and unknown in 0.97%. Among NAA, patients were either identified as definite RLS (35.63%) or not RLS (64.37%); no patients were diagnosed as probable RLS or unknown. Logistic regression analysis was done to determine whether age, race, and sex were statistically significant predictors of an RLS diagnosis. When accounting for the other variables, the association between NAA and RLS prevalence was statistically significant (P = 0.002).Restless legs syndrome is common among primary care clinic patients. Its prevalence in the NAA population is approximately 3 times higher than in the AA group. We found the association between NAA race and RLS prevalence to be statistically significant. Larger studies are needed to further examine the relation between race and RLS prevalence.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255415","annotations":[{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.641284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.471137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.388367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.371139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.121231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.113791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Johns Hopkins University","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Restless legs syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_legs_syndrome"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Alcoholics Anonymous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous"},{"name":"Gospel of John","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"The Automobile Association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Automobile_Association"},{"name":"Human genetic variation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_variation"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
