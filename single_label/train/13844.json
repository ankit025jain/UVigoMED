{"id":13844,"title":"How to establish acute myeloid leukemia xenograft models using immunodeficient mice.","abstract":"The discovery of the immunodeficient mice has provided a tool for establishing animal models as hosts for in vivo analysis of AML. Various model systems have been established in the last few decades, and it is essential that murine AML models are developed to exploit more specific, targeted therapeutics. In this review, we concentrate on the models of AML and discuss the development of immunodeficiency models for understanding of leukemogenesis, describe those now available and their values and document the methods used for establishing and identifying AML mice models, as well as factors influencing engraftment of human AML in immunodeficient mice. Thus, the function of this article is to provide clinicians and experimentalists with a chronological, comprehensive appraisal of all AML model systems.
