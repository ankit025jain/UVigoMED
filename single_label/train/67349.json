{"id":67349,"title":"Occurrence of the polyomavirus among kidney transplant recipients: a single-center study.","abstract":"Polyoma virus-associated nephropathy is an increasingly recognized cause of graft dysfunction among kidney transplant recipients and could be the result of use of potent immunosuppression following transplantation. Because there is no safe and effective anti-viral therapy available presently, screening-based prevention and pre-emptive strategy are recommended. This study, which was conducted at the Nephrology Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Alexandria University, consisted of two phases: Phase 1 was a cross-sectional study and phase 2 was a 6-month follow-up study only for polyoma virus-positive cases. Phase 1 included 75 renal allograft recipients from living donors. Urine cytology for decoy cells and quantitative real-time blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the BK virus (BKV) were performed on all the study patients. Renal biopsy was performed only in patients with deteriorating renal function associated with positive urine cytology. Patients who showed positive urine cytology for decoy cells and/or positive quantitative BKV PCR assay were followed-up for six months. During follow-up, the serum creatinine level, with or without urine cytology for decoy cells, and BKV PCR viral load assay were performed. Among the 75 kidney transplant recipients studied, eight were positive for decoy cells (11%), three showed viremia by quantitative PCR for BKV (4.1%), while two others showed nephropathy (2.7%) in the form of tubulointerstitial nephritis with intra-nuclear inclusions in the tubular cells. Cases with stable renal function and positive decoy cells or viremia cleared the virus spontaneously during follow-up without any intervention. Only one case with biopsyproven nephropathy and deteriorating graft function, with undetectable BKV in blood, lost the graft while another case with viremia died during follow-up due to septicemia. Our study suggests that polyoma virus should be considered as a cause of nephropathy in renal transplant recipients. Further research is required to understand this entity better.
