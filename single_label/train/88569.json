{"id":88569,"title":"[Cannulated screw combined with buttress plate for the treatment of transarticular shear fractures of the distal humerus].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical outcomes of cannulated screw combined with buttress plate in treating transarticular shear fractures of the distal humerus.From July 2008 to December 2011, 17 patients with shear fractures of the distal humerus were treated with cannulated screw combined with buttress plate. Among them, included 10 males and 7 females aged from 20 to 59 years old (mean 36.5). All the fractures were classified into type I (8 cases), type II (1 case), type III (3 cases) and type IV (5 cases) according to Bryan-Morrey and McKee classification. According to AO/ASIF classification, 10 cases were type 13B3.1, 7 cases were type 13B3.3; according to Dubberley classification, 5 cases with type 1A, 2 cases with type 1B, 2 cases with type 2A, 2 cases with type 2B, 4 cases with type 3A, 2 cases with type 3B. There were 12 cases with fresh injuries, 4 cases with old injuries. All fractures were closed injuries. Complications and range of motion of elbow were observed, and clinical efficacy were evaluated by Broberg-Morrey standard.All patients were followed up with a mean time of 21.3 months (ranged, 18 to 24). All fractures obtained bone healing from 10 to 15 weeks with a mean of 12.5 weeks. No malunion or delayed healing occurred. Two cases occurred ossification in lateral collateral ligament attachment. 2 cases occurred heterotopic ossification in the capitellum in front of capsule joint. The range of elbow extension was (16 +/- 7) degrees, flexion was (115 +/- 9) degrees, the average are of pronation and supination was (65 +/- 5) degrees and (60 +/- 5) degrees respectively. According to Broberg-Morrey standard, there were excellent in 7 cases, good in 8 cases, fair in 2 cases, and average score was 92.44 +/- 4.64.For transarticular shear fractures of the distal humerus, classification should be performed according to preoperative X-ray and CT, cannulated screw and buttress plate combined and early function rehabilitation could recover elbow function.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Wounds and
