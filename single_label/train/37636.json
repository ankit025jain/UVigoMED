{"id":37636,"title":"Guanine nucleotide-binding protein ? subunit hypofunction in children with short stature and disproportionate shortening of the 4th and 5th metacarpals.","abstract":"GNAS encodes the ? subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs?). Maternal inherited Gs? mutations cause pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP-Ia), associated with shortening of the 4th and 5th metacarpals.Here we investigated the Gs? pathway in short patients with distinct shortening of the 4th and 5th metacarpals.In 571 children with short stature and 4 patients with PHP-Ia metacarpal bone lengths were measured. In identified patients we analysed the Gs? protein function in platelets, performed GNAS sequencing, and epigenetic analysis of four significant differentially methylated regions.In 51 patients (8.9%) shortening of the 4th and 5th metacarpals was more pronounced than their height deficit. No GNAS coding mutations were identified in 20 analysed patients, except in 2 PHP-Ia patients. Gs? activity was reduced in all PHP-Ia patients and in 25% of the analysed patients. No significant methylation changes were identified.Our findings suggest that patients with short stature and distinct metacarpal bone shortening could be part of the wide variety of PHP/PPHP, therefore it was worthwhile analysing the Gs? protein function and GNAS gene in these patients in order to further elucidate the phenotype and genotype of Gs? dysfunction.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481334","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.847261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.760749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.752798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.682997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"G protein","weight":0.451562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Metacarpus","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpus"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Pseudohypoparathyroidism","weight":0.242222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudohypoparathyroidism"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.211657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"GNAS complex locus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNAS_complex_locus"},{"name":"Short stature","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stature"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Disproportionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disproportionation"},{"name":"Type Ia supernova","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova"},{"name":"Gs alpha subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gs_alpha_subunit"},{"name":"Horse length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length"},{"name":"Ia (genus)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ia_(genus)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
