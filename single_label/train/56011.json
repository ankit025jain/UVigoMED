{"id":56011,"title":"Patterns and causes of epiphora referrals to a tertiary oculoplastic practice.","abstract":"To report the causative factors and surgical candidacy of patients referred to an oculoplastic surgery clinic for the complaint of epiphora.Prospective observational study.Consecutive patients (n = 159) referred to a tertiary care oculoplastic surgery clinic over a 12-month period for the complaint of epiphora.The causative factor most responsible for tearing was determined based on clinical examination by the principal investigator, who was blinded to referral source. Patients were considered surgical candidates with a diagnosis of significant nasolacrimal duct obstruction, lid malposition, or pump dysfunction. The primary outcome was the percentage of referrals that were surgical candidates, classified by referral source.The most common cause of tearing was nasolacrimal duct obstruction, occurring in 53 of 159 (33%) patients. The percentage of surgical candidates was highest in referrals from ophthalmologists (82%), followed by optometrists (67%) and family physicians (55%; p = 0.011 for difference between ophthalmologists and family physicians).Epiphora may be because of a variety of causes, some of which are amendable to surgical treatment. In the absence of an obvious cause, a trial of lubrication by the family physician is warranted before referral being made to an oculoplastic surgeon.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767225","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Family medicine","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_medicine"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.660218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.354654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.353153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.271842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Nasolacrimal duct","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolacrimal_duct"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Oculoplastics","weight":0.0993966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculoplastics"},{"name":"Detective","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Principal investigator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_investigator"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vaginal lubrication","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_lubrication"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
