{"id":31073,"title":"Tick repellents for human use: prevention of tick bites and tick-borne diseases.","abstract":"Ticks are arthropods and the most important vectors of major human diseases after mosquitoes. Due to their impact on public health, in vitro and in vivo assays have been developed to identify molecules with repellent activities on ticks. Repellents are useful to reduce tick bite exposure and the potential transmission of pathogens; they can be used topically or in impregnated clothing. Presently, mainly synthetic molecules are commercialized as skin repellents, e.g., N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), IR3535, picaridin or KBR 3023, and para-menthanediol. Permethrin is largely used for fabric impregnation. Intensive research has been conducted to identify new molecules with repellent activity and more recently, plant-derived molecules, as an alternative to synthetic molecules.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410143","annotations":[{"name":"Arthropod","weight":0.807321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Mosquito","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.748311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.677114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.643364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.524779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Insect repellent","weight":0.473334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_repellent"},{"name":"DEET","weight":0.45489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEET"},{"name":"Textile","weight":0.414057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.304581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Permethrin","weight":0.294048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permethrin"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.277041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Tick-borne disease","weight":0.221652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick-borne_disease"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.179976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Venom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom"},{"name":"Spider bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_bite"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
