We divided these patients into 2 groups, whereby 32 (47%) patients received conservative therapy before arthroscopic subacromial decompression and 36 (53%) patients did not receive conservative therapy. We compared both groups in terms of the the Constant, UCLA, and VAS scores for shoulder pain before and after arthroscopic subacromial decompression.Constant, UCLA, and VAS scores were statistically significantly improved in both groups after arthroscopic subacromial decompression (P <0.001). Constant, UCLA, and VAS scores before arthroscopic subacromial decompression were statistically better in Group 1 than in Group 2 (P < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of Constant, UCLA, and VAS scores after arthroscopic subacromial decompression (P > 0.05).Conservative therapy applied in patients with stage 2 shoulder impingement syndrome before arthroscopic subacromial decompression does not have a positive contribution on the clinical outcome after arthroscopic subacromial decompression.","date":"2014-12-25","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25539560","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.526866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.398818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.287322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.263488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"University of California, Los Angeles","weight":0.110635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0252209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Shoulder problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_problem"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"}]}
