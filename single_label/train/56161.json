{"id":56161,"title":"Vitreous hyper-reflective dots in optical coherence tomography and cystoid macular edema after uneventful phacoemulsification surgery.","abstract":"To report the observation of hyper-reflective dots in the vitreous cavity using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) after uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery and to investigate their association with cystoid macular edema (CME).Medical records of consecutive Asian patients who had no preoperative retinopathy and underwent uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery from March 2012 through February 2013 were reviewed. SD-OCTs were performed before, 1 week, and 1 month after surgery. The number of vitreous hyper-reflective dots (VHDs) was counted in 5 OCT images of high-definition 5-line raster scans. The development of CME was assessed using postoperative 1-month OCT.In 74 eyes of 74 patients, all of three SD-OCTs with a signal to noise ratio of 0.6 or more were available and were analyzed in this study. In preoperative OCT, the VHD was observed in 2 (2.7%) of 74 eyes; one eye had 1 VHD and the other eye had 2 VHDs. In 72 eyes with no preoperative VHD, VHDs were observed in 40 (55.6%) eyes at 1 week after the surgery. In the multivariate analysis, the number of VHDs measured at 1 week after the surgery was significantly associated with CME development at 1 month after the surgery (odds ratio?=?1.93, 95% confidence interval?=?1.15 to 3.24, P?=?0.012).VHDs were frequently observed in OCT after uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery. VHDs observed at 1 week after the surgery may be a risk factor for the development of pseudophakic CME. Further studies are needed to identify the source of the VHDs.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736274","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.842136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.695645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Signal-to-noise ratio","weight":0.684281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.57991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.509643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.475208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.4468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.406078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.223179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.112985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Video High Density","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_High_Density"},{"name":"Cystoids","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoids"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Visible spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Optical cavity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_cavity"},{"name":"Continuing medical education","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_medical_education"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Raster scan","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_scan"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
