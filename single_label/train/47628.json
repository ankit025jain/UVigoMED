{"id":47628,"title":"Tumour-associated macrophages targeted transfection with NF-?B decoy/mannose-modified bubble lipoplexes inhibits tumour growth in tumour-bearing mice.","abstract":"Tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) exhibit an M2 phenotype that promotes tumour progression, and conversion of M2 TAM toward a tumouricidal M1 phenotype is a promising anti-cancer therapy. As NF-?B is a key regulator of macrophage polarization, we developed an in vivo TAM-targeting delivery system that combines mannose-modified bubble liposomes/NF-?B decoy complexes (Man-PEG bubble lipoplexes) and ultrasound (US) exposure. We investigated the effects of NF-?B decoy transfection on TAM phenotype in solid tumour-bearing mice. Post-transfection tumour growth and survival rates were also recorded. Th2 cytokine (IL-10) level in TAM was significantly lower by NF-?B decoy transfection using Man-PEG bubble lipoplexes and US exposure, while Th1 cytokine levels (IL-1?, TNF-? and IL-6) were significantly higher when compared with controls. In addition, mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and arginase were significantly lower in TAM post-NF-?B decoy transfection. Importantly, TAM-targeted NF-?B decoy transfection inhibited tumour growth and prolonged survival rates in mice. Therefore, TAM-targeted NF-?B decoy transfection using Man-PEG bubble lipoplexes and US exposure may be an effective approach for anti-cancer therapy based on TAM phenotypic conversion from M2 toward M1.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579693","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.699578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.550154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.446841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.402214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.352069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Arginase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginase"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"}]}
