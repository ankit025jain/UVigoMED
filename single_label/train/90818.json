{"id":90818,"title":"MR imaging and T2 measurements in peripheral nerve repair with activation of Toll-like receptor 4 of neurotmesis.","abstract":"To investigate the role of MR imaging in neurotmesis combined with surgical repair and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation.Forty-eight rats received subepineurial microinjection of the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS, n?=?24) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n?=?24) immediately after surgical repair of the transected sciatic nerve. Sequential fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging and quantitative T2 measurements were obtained at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and histological quantification of the distal stumps were measured and compared.The distal stumps of transected nerves treated with LPS or PBS both showed persistent enlargement and hyperintense signal. T2 values of the distal stumps showed a rapid rise to peak level followed by a rapid decline pattern in nerves treated with LPS, while exhibiting a slow rise to peak value followed by a slow decline in nerves treated with PBS. Nerves treated with LPS exhibited more prominent macrophage recruitment, faster myelin debris clearance and more pronounced nerve regeneration.Nerves treated with TLR4 activation had a characteristic pattern of T2 value change over time. Longitudinal T2 measurements can be used to detect the enhanced repair effect associated with TLR4 activation in the surgical repair of neurotmesis.• TLR4 activation had additional beneficial effects on neurotmesis beyond surgical repair. • TLR4 activation had a characteristic time course of T2 values. • T2 measurements can help detect beneficial effects with TLR4 activation.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Wounds and
