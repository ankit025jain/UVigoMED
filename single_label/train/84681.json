{"id":84681,"title":"Spectrum of phenotypic anomalies in four families with deletion of the SHOX enhancer region.","abstract":"SHOX alterations have been reported in 67% of patients affected by Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD), with a larger prevalence of gene deletions than point mutations. It has been recently demonstrated that these deletions can involve the SHOX enhancer region, rather that the coding region, with variable phenotype of the affected patients.Here, we report a SHOX gene analysis carried out by MLPA in 14 LWD patients from 4 families with variable phenotype.All patients presented a SHOX enhancer deletion. In particular, a patient with a severe bilateral Madelung deformity without short stature showed a homozygous alteration identical to the recently described 47.5 kb PAR1 deletion. Moreover, we identified, for the first time, in three related patients with a severe bilateral Madelung deformity, a smaller deletion than the 47.5 kb PAR1 deletion encompassing the same enhancer region (ECR1/CNE7).Data reported in this study provide new information about the spectrum of phenotypic alterations showed by LWD patients with different deletions of the SHOX enhancer region.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25056248","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.762575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Enhancer (genetics)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_(genetics)"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.417882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Short stature","weight":0.251888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stature"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Short stature homeobox gene","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stature_homeobox_gene"},{"name":"Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_ligation-dependent_probe_amplification"},{"name":"Electromagnetic spectrum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Bird species new to science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_species_new_to_science"},{"name":"Logging while drilling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_while_drilling"},{"name":"Coagulation factor II receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation_factor_II_receptor"},{"name":"European Conservatives and Reformists","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Conservatives_and_Reformists"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Altered chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
