{"id":34771,"title":"Promotora de salud: promoting folic acid use among Hispanic women.","abstract":"The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that all women in the United States capable of becoming pregnant consume 400??g of folic acid daily to reduce their risk of having a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect (NTD). However, disparities exist in the consumption of folic acid, with Hispanic women having lower rates of folic acid consumption than non-Hispanic white women.A community-based feasibility study was designed to assess the utility of the promotora de salud model to promote consumption of multivitamins containing folic acid for the prevention of NTDs among Spanish-speaking Hispanic women in North Carolina. The study consisted of an educational intervention given by a promotora (a lay, community health worker), with data collection occurring at baseline and four months post-intervention to measure changes in knowledge and behavior. Overall, 52% (n=303) of participants completed all components of the study.Self-reported daily multivitamin consumption increased from 24% at baseline to 71% four months post-intervention. During the same time frame, awareness of folic acid increased from 78% to 98% and knowledge of the role of folic acid in the prevention of birth defects increased from 82% to 92%.The results of this study indicate that the promotora de salud model may be effective in reaching a subpopulation of women with the folic acid message. Additional studies with larger population sizes are warranted to validate these findings.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24707879","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.674262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.574663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.475452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.461641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.355173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.252943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"United States Public Health Service","weight":0.201491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Public_Health_Service"},{"name":"North Carolina","weight":0.189796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.18626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Data collection","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection"},{"name":"Community health","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Neural tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube"},{"name":"Multivitamin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivitamin"},{"name":"Neural tube defect","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube_defect"},{"name":"Community health worker","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_worker"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Laity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity"},{"name":"Feasibility study","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"}]}
