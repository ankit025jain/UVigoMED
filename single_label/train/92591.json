{"id":92591,"title":"Cutaneous manifestations of rheumatic diseases. Clinical presentation and underlying pathophysiology.","abstract":"Being the largest organ of the human body, skin is frequently affected in many rheumatic diseases. Thus, it can serve as an important indicator for the correct diagnosis of a rheumatic disease and also as a marker of disease activity in distinct rheumatic disorders. In this review we will highlight the clinical features of these cutaneous manifestations of the major rheumatic diseases. We will also provide an update on the complex pathobiology of these diseases based on the most recent developments in clinical and translational research.
