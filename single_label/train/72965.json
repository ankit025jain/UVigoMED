{"id":72965,"title":"Quality of life issues in head and neck cancer.","abstract":"Head and neck cancer (HNC) constitutes approximately 3% of all cancers in the UK, with in excess of 8500 new cases annually. Management of HNC depends on site, extent, histology, previous medical history and patient choice. A multidisciplinary approach is required to optimize patient wellbeing, owing to the significant functional and psychosocial implications that can impact on quality of life. Members of the dental team, to include the general dental practitioner, have a key role in patient care; therefore the dental team should be knowledgeable in the short-term and longer-term implications and how this impacts on quality of life.This article offers the dental team with an overview of how HNC and the various treatments, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, impact upon quality of life, both in the short-term and longer-term.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930257","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.812922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.637329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.634738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.597618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.456715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.45027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.440988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.401363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.128971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Higher National Certificate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_National_Certificate"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary approach","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_approach"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
