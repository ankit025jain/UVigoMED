{"id":36702,"title":"Pyloric exclusion for treatment of complicated duodenal atresia.","abstract":"Duodenal atresia (DA) is a well-described congenital anomaly that usually responds well to surgical correction. Associated defects are common, and these confounding variables often influence outcome. The authors present a case of a newborn female with an unusual constellation of problems including DA with annular pancreas, trisomy 21, and coarctation of the aorta. She developed protracted complications postoperatively and was treated with an innovative surgical strategy.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556975","annotations":[{"name":"Coarctation of the aorta","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarctation_of_the_aorta"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.73916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.716901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.617559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.40435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pylorus","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Constellation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation"},{"name":"Trisomy 21","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy_21"},{"name":"Annular pancreas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_pancreas"},{"name":"Duodenal atresia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenal_atresia"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Annulus (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"}]}
