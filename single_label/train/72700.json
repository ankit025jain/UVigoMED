{"id":72700,"title":"Cytotoxic enhancement of hexapeptide-conjugated micelles in EGFR high-expressed cancer cells.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to develop the hexapeptide-conjugated active targeting micelles for delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX) to EGFR high-expressed cancer cells.A hexapeptide, which mimicked the EGFR, was applied as a targeting ligand. The active targeting micelles were prepared using the synthesized poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)-PEG copolymer conjugated with the hexapeptide. The micelles were used for encapsulating DOX and/or PTX, and the cellular uptake, in vitro drug release and cellular viability of drug-loaded peptide-conjugated and peptide-free micelles were investigated.The particle size of drug-loaded peptide-conjugated and peptide-free micelles was < 150 nm with narrow size distribution. The uptake of peptide-conjugated micelles was more efficient in EGFR high-expressed MDA-MB-468 and SKOV3 cells than in EGFR low-expressed HepG2 cells. The in vitro release of DOX and PTX was faster in pH 4.0 (500 U lipase) than in pH 7.4 release medium. The cytotoxicity in terms of IC50 of DOX/PTX-loaded peptide-conjugated micelles was 4.8-folds lower than that of peptide-free micelles and 18.2-folds lower than DOX/PTX drug solution in SOKV3 cells.The peptide-conjugated micelles acted as a nanocarrier to increase intracellular accumulation of anticancer drugs in EGFR high-expressed SKOV3 cancer cells to enhance cell cytotoxicity.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24950257","annotations":[{"name":"Paclitaxel","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Lipase","weight":0.714885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Conjugated system","weight":0.578839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_system"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Micelle","weight":0.556127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micelle"},{"name":"Copolymer","weight":0.535303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.444648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.408367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.388693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.207234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.186966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.119121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Pertussis toxin","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertussis_toxin"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
