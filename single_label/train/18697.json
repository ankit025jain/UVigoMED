{"id":18697,"title":"Cardiac tamponade complicating purulent pericarditis due to community acquired methicilin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).","abstract":"Community acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus(CA-MRSA) is a global pathogen capable of causing life-threatening infections with increasing prevalence since the 1990s. Purulentpericarditis, characterized by accumulation of purulent fluid in the pericardial space was historically a disease of the pediatric and early adult population, but through the years the median age of diagnosis has increased from 21 to 49. Mortality rates are as high as 40% even in the treated population. We report a case of purulent pericarditis due to CA-MRSA that was complicated by cardiac tamponade. Early diagnosis and intervention proved to be life-saving. A brief review of the literature and current management options are discussed.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772835","annotations":[{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.829553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.76877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.633765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Pericarditis","weight":0.53377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericarditis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.459674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.396728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.366486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Pericardium","weight":0.198952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardium"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.1201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0623561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Meticillin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meticillin"},{"name":"Pericardial cavity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericardial_cavity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Cardiac tamponade","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_tamponade"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"1990s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Lifesaving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifesaving"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"}]}
