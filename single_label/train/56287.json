{"id":56287,"title":"Retinal prosthesis.","abstract":"Retinal prosthesis has been translated from the laboratory to the clinic over the past two decades. Currently, two devices have regulatory approval for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa. These devices provide partial sight restoration and patients use this improved vision in their everyday lives. Improved mobility and object detection are some of the more notable findings from the clinical trials. However, significant vision restoration will require both better technology and improved understanding of the interaction between electrical stimulation and the retina. This paper reviews the recent clinical trials and highlights technology breakthroughs that will contribute to next generation of retinal prostheses.
