{"id":54906,"title":"Limitations in imaging common conjunctival and corneal pathologies with fourier-domain optical coherence tomography.","abstract":"To describe the limitations of Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) in imaging common conjunctival and corneal pathology.Retrospective, single-center case series of 40 patients with conjunctival and cornea pathology.Fourier-domain OCT imaged laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) flaps in detail, including its relation to other corneal structures and abnormalities. Similarly, in infectious or degenerative corneal disorders, Fourier-domain OCT successfully showed the extent of infiltration or material deposition, which appeared as hyper-reflective areas. In cases with pterygium, the underlying cornea could not be imaged. All cases of common conjunctival pathologies, such as nevus or pinguecula, were successfully imaged in detail. Nevi, scleritis, pterygium, pinguecula, and subconjunctival hemorrhage were hyper-reflective lesions, while cysts and lymphangiectasia were hyporeflective. The details of the underlying sclera were not uniformly imaged in conjunctival pathologies. Fourier-domain OCT imaged the trabeculectomy bleb in detail, whereas the details of structures of the anterior chamber angle were not routinely visualized in all cases.Light scatter through vascularized, densely inflamed, or thick lesions limits the imaging capabilities of Fourier-domain anterior segment OCT.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25100905","annotations":[{"name":"Sclera","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Keratomileusis","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratomileusis"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.775198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.70242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Subconjunctival hemorrhage","weight":0.643984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconjunctival_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.5827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Scleritis","weight":0.432155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleritis"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Scattering","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering"},{"name":"Pinguecula","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinguecula"},{"name":"Pterygium","weight":0.140405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygium"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.125854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0934771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Trabeculectomy","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabeculectomy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Nevus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus"},{"name":"Lymphangiectasia","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphangiectasia"}]}
