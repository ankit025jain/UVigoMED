{"id":86528,"title":"After adjusting for bias in meta-analysis seasonal influenza vaccine remains effective in community-dwelling elderly.","abstract":"To compare the performance of the bias-adjusted meta-analysis to the conventional meta-analysis assessing seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness among community-dwelling elderly aged 60 years and older.Systematic literature search revealed 14 cohort studies that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Laboratory-confirmed influenza, influenza-like illness, hospitalization from influenza and/or pneumonia, and all-cause mortality were study outcomes. Potential biases were identified using bias checklists. The magnitude and uncertainty of biases were assessed by expert opinion. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using random effects model.After incorporating biases, overall effect estimates regressed slightly toward no effect, with the largest relative difference between conventional and bias-adjusted ORs for laboratory-confirmed influenza (OR, 0.18; 95% CI: 0.01, 3.00 vs. OR, 0.23; 95% CI: 0.03, 2.04). In most of the studies, CIs widened reflecting uncertainties about the biases. The between-study heterogeneity reduced considerably with the largest reduction for all-cause mortality (I(2) = 4%, P = 0.39 vs. I(2) = 91%, P < 0.01).This case study showed that after addressing potential biases influenza vaccine was still estimated effective in preventing hospitalization from influenza and/or pneumonia and all-cause mortality. Increasing the number of assessors and incorporating empirical evidence might improve the new bias-adjustment method.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768004","annotations":[{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.813201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.709756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.684946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.606261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Uncertainty","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.381389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.273265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.236608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.229805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.137124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Relative change and difference","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_change_and_difference"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Expert witness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness"},{"name":"Empirical research","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Assessor (Italy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assessor_(Italy)"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"The New Era","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Era"},{"name":"Flu season","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season"}]}
