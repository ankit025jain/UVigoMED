{"id":72312,"title":"Quantitative expression of estrogen receptor on relapse biopsy for ER-positive breast cancer: prognostic impact.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of quantitative estrogen receptor (ER) expression at relapse for ER-positive breast cancer with ER-positive recurrence.A total of 81 patients with ER-positive primary breast cancer and ER-positive paired recurrence were included. ER expression was evaluated as the percentage of tumor cells staining for ER under immunohistochemistry. Samples were defined as ER-high (ER>50%) or ER-low (ER?10% and ?50%).Quantitative ER expression on relapse biopsy was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in multivariate analysis, both as a continuous (hazard ratio=0.8; 95% confidence interval=0.7-0.92, p=0.001) and as a categorical (ER-high vs. ER-low; hazard ratio=0.26; 95% confidence interval=0.11-0.59, p=0.001) variable. Patients whose status changed from ER-high (primary BC) to ER-low (relapse) had the poorest outcome, with a 10-year overall survival rate of 14%.Even in the case of maintenance of ER-positivity on primary and relapse of breast cancer, recurrence biopsy provides prognostic information.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982383","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.850716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.839573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.683817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.583644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.564344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.559055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.435614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"ER (TV series)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Category theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
