{"id":64887,"title":"Comparison of polymerase chain reaction and immunologic methods for the detection of nanobacterial infection in type-III prostatitis.","abstract":"To compare the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunologic methods for the detection of nanobacteria (NB) in the expressed prostatic secretions (EPSs) of patients with type-III prostatitis.In total, 150 patients with type-III prostatitis for whom conventional clinical treatment had failed were selected from September 2009 to April 2010. The EPS of each patient was divided into 3 parts, which were used for PCR analysis, indirect immunofluorescence staining (IIFS), and culture and subsequent indirect immunofluorescence staining (CIIFS).PCR analysis has a higher sensitivity than IIFS for the detection of NB in EPSs. Of 83 CIIFS-positive EPS samples, 79 (95.2%) were positive by PCR. Of 67 EPS samples that were negative by CIIFS, 60 (89.6%) were negative by PCR. The sensitivity of PCR for the detection of NB compared with the CIIFS method was 95.2%, with a specificity of 89.6%. The positive predictive value was 91.9%, and the negative predictive value was 93.8%. A comparative evaluation showed no statistically significant difference between PCR and CIIFS in the detection of NB in EPSs. A strong agreement in the positive and the negative results obtained by PCR and CIIFS for NB detection was found for all EPS samples.PCR analysis has a higher sensitivity than IIFS for NB detection in type-III prostatitis. PCR can detect nanobacterial infection in type-III prostatitis equally well as CIIFS and offers significant advantages for the rapid, simple, and economical detection of nanobacterial infection in type-III prostatitis.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25168570","annotations":[{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.901776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.831623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.552096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.412183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.24992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.219691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Nanobacterium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanobacterium"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polystyrene","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Comparative linguistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_linguistics"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Nota bene","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nota_bene"},{"name":"Individual Integrated Fighting System","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Integrated_Fighting_System"}]}
