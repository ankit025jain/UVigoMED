{"id":81963,"title":"Immunohistochemical expression of syndecan-1 in oral dysplastic epithelium.","abstract":"In stratified squamous epithelia, syndecan-1 is proposed to function as a cellto cell adhesion molecule, and plays an important role in regulation of cell growth and differentiation during the developmental process. Oral cancer is a disease with complex etiology, so biological behavior in carcinomas preceded by dysplastic states is difficult to assess and predict its prognosis. Hence, syndecan-1, a recently recognized tumor marker has been proved to be an eminent diagnostic and prognostic tool in assessing biological behavior of various potentially premalignant andmalignant lesions.The study group consisted of 40 specimens of premalignant stateand 10 specimens of normal mucosa.Thesections were stained withhematoxylin and eosin, andimmunohistochemicallyusing syndecan-1 a primary antibody and was observed under light microscope.Expression decreased with the decreasing grades of dysplasia.Syndecan-1 can be efficiently used in early detection and diagnosis of oral carcinoma.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762495","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor
