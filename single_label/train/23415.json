{"id":23415,"title":"A recombinant bivalent fusion protein rVE confers active and passive protection against Yersinia enterocolitica infection in mice.","abstract":"In the present study, a bivalent chimeric protein rVE comprising immunologically active domains of Yersinia pestis LcrV and YopE was assessed for its prophylactic abilities against Yersinia enterocolitica O:8 infection in murine model. Mice immunized with rVE elicited significantly higher antibody titers with substantial contribution from the rV component (3:1 ratio). Robust and significant resistance to Y. enterocolitica infection with 100% survival (P<0.001) was seen in rVE vaccinated mice when intra peritoneal (I.P.) challenged with 10(8)CFU of Y. enterocolitica O:8 against the 75%, 60% and 75% survival seen in mice immunized with rV, rE, rV+rE, respectively. Macrophage monolayer supplemented with anti-rVE polysera illustrated efficient protection (89.41% survival) against challenge of Y. enterocolitica O:8. In contrast to sera from sham-immunized mice, immunization with anti-rVE polysera provided complete protection to BALB/c mice against I.P. challenge with 10(8)CFU of Y. enterocolitica O:8 and developed no conspicuous signs of infection in necropsy. The histopathological analysis of microtome sections confirmed significantly reduced lesion size or no lesion in liver and intestine upon infection in anti-rVE immunized mice. The findings from this study demonstrated the fusion protein rVE as a potential candidate subunit vaccine and showed the functional role of antibodies in protection against Y. enterocolitica infections.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486353","annotations":[{"name":"Yersinia pestis","weight":0.951721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_pestis"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.804172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.724129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.684931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.680307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.612737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.473513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.386679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.383484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.366389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Yersinia","weight":0.0328325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia"},{"name":"Microtome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtome"},{"name":"Yersinia enterocolitica","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yersinia_enterocolitica"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
