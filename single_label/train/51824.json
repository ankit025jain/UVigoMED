{"id":51824,"title":"Association between use of FK506 and prevalence of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus in kidney transplant patients.","abstract":"Tacrolimus (FK506) use has been suggested as a risk factor for post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) because it can impair insulin secretion. This association warrants further investigation. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of PTDM and its association with FK506 use in kidney transplant recipients. The study also aimed to examine the relationship of FK506 use and diabetes-related biologic markers.A retrospective chart review was used to collect data at a medical center in northern Taiwan from September 2003 to February 2012. PTDM was defined with the use of the criteria of the American Diabetes Association.Among 166 patients included in the analysis, PTDM was reported in 49 patients (29.5%). A total of 93 patients used the FK506 regimen, of whom 34 (36.6%) were PTDM cases. Logistic regression showed that FK506 use (odds ratio [OR], 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-6.11; P = .016) and older age (OR,1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13; P = .001) were significant risk factors for PTDM. In addition, FK506 use in PTDM cases was associated with a significantly higher hemoglobin A1c level (7.55 vs 5.81; P = .01) and a borderline significantly higher insulin resistance index (3.24 vs 1.92; P = .053) than was FK506 use without the presence of PTDM.Older age and an FK506 regimen were important predictors of the prevalence of PTDM. Greater early detection and prevention efforts for PTDM are needed for older transplant recipients. PTDM patients with an FK506 regimen had higher hemoglobin A1c levels and insulin resistance index than did patients who did not use FK506. The association of serum indicators with FK506 use in the prevalence of PTDM warrants further investigation.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656004","annotations":[{"name":"American Diabetes Association","weight":0.931339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Diabetes_Association"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.898002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.86732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.610337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.604261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.51033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.460133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.323237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.232269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
