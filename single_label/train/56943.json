{"id":56943,"title":"Is there a relationship between age and side dominance of tubal ectopic pregnancies? --A preliminary report.","abstract":"To determine whether there exists a relationship between age and side dominance of tubal ectopic pregnancies.One hundred twenty patients were retrospectively analyzed. The sides of the tubal ectopic pregnancies were recorded on the basis of laparoscopy or laparotomy findings. Five age groups were created: 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and > or = 40 years.Of the patients who were > 30 years of age, 46 (69%) and 21 (31%) had tubal ectopic pregnancies on the right and left sides, respectively (p = 0.002). In the 35-39 years of age group, 17 of 20 patients (85%) had tubal ectopic pregnancies on the right, and 3 of 20 patients (15%) on the left side (p = 0.002). In the 30-34 years of age group, 26 of 39 patients (67%) and 13 of 39 patients (33%) had tubal ectopic pregnancies on the right and left sides, respectively (p = 0.037). In the > or = 40 years of age group, 3 of 8 patients (37%) had tubal ectopic pregnancy on the right side, while 5 patients (63%) on the left side (p = 0.48).Patients who are between the age of 30-40 years have a right-sided dominance of tubal ectopic pregnancy however studies that involve larger numbers of subjects are needed to make definitive conclusions about women older than 40 years of age.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322539","annotations":[{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.919338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.383056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"2024","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Dominance and submission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_and_submission"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Commodore 4040","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_4040"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"}]}
