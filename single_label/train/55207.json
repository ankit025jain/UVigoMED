{"id":55207,"title":"Mechanism for laser-induced neovascularization in rat choroid: accumulation of integrin ? chain-positive cells and their ligands.","abstract":"Inhibitors binding to integrins ?5 and ?v are antiangiogenic in models of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). However, a comprehensive understanding of the accumulation of integrin ? isoform-positive cells, their ligands, and associations is limited. The purpose of the present study was to examine the localization of integrin ? chain-positive cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands in the RPE/choroid after laser injury.CNV, observed with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled isolectin, was produced in Brown Norway rats with a 532 nm green laser. Localization of ?5 and ?v integrins and their ligands was performed with immunohistochemistry in consecutive cryosections. To test the binding specificity between the integrin ? chains and ECM ligands, an in vitro cell adhesion assay was performed using retinal endothelial cells and specific antibodies.Angiogenesis was observed on day 7 after laser injury in choroidal flat mounts and cryosections. The number of integrin ?5- and ?v-positive cells markedly increased at day 3 and then gradually decreased, but was still elevated on day 14. One day after laser treatment, ? integrin ligands fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN) were markedly increased, and localized closely to integrins in the laser-injured regions. FN decreased on day 7, but was still retained until 14 days. In contrast, VN disappeared. Cell adhesion assays showed specific association of integrin ?5 to FN, and integrin ?v to VN.Laser-induced choroidal injury increased FN and VN, followed by accumulation of integrin ?5- and ?v-positive cells. The interaction between integrin ? chain-positive cells and their specific ligands FN and VN may be important steps leading to CNV.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24959065","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Fibronectin","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibronectin"},{"name":"Vitronectin","weight":0.830406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitronectin"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.743735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.615836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Isothiocyanate","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothiocyanate"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.194893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.191581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.180064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.150837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Laser surgery","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_surgery"},{"name":"Norway","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"},{"name":"Fluorescein isothiocyanate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_isothiocyanate"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Green tea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Side chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Brown rat","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat"}]}
