{"id":89711,"title":"Effect of HMB/Arg/Gln on the prevention of radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.","abstract":"This prospective randomized Phase II study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of an oral nutrition supplement composed of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, arginine and glutamine (beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate/arginine/glutamine) on radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients.Forty patients with histologically proven head and neck cancer, treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy involving cisplatin were recruited. They were randomly assigned to the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate/arginine/glutamine supplement treatment group (Group A) or the control group that received no supplement (Group B). The primary endpoint of this study was the percentage of patients developing ?Grade 3 dermatitis. The secondary endpoints were the percentage of patients developing ?Grade 2 dermatitis, and the duration of each grade of dermatitis relative to the observation period.The incidence of ?Grade 3 dermatitis did not differ between the two groups. However, as secondary endpoints of this study, the incidence of ?Grade 2 dermatitis was lower in Group A than B (62.6 vs. 94.4%; P < 0.05), and the duration of ?Grade 1 dermatitis was shorter in Group A than B (44.8 vs. 56.7%; P < 0.01), as was the duration of ?Grade 2 dermatitis (16.5 vs. 26.5%; P < 0.05).Our study indicated that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate/arginine/glutamine supplementation was potentially effective in the prevention of radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24688085","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Glutamine","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.702851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.506431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.476213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.196343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Radiation dermatitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_dermatitis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"End point of clinical trials","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_point_of_clinical_trials"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Graded stakes race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
