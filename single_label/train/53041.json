{"id":53041,"title":"Role for high-glucose-induced protein O-GlcNAcylation in stimulating cardiac fibroblast collagen synthesis.","abstract":"Excess enzyme-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation is known to occur with diabetes mellitus. A characteristic of diabetic cardiomyopathy is the development of myocardial fibrosis. The role that enhanced protein O-GlcNAcylation plays in modulating the phenotype of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) is unknown. To address this issue, rat CF were cultured in normal glucose (NG; 5 mM glucose) or high-glucose (HG; 25 mM) media for 48 h. Results demonstrate that CF cultured in HG have higher levels (~50%) of overall protein O-GlcNAcylation vs. NG cells. Key regulators of collagen synthesis such as transforming-growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1), SMADs 2/3, and SMAD 7 protein levels, including those of arginase I and II, were altered, leading to increases in collagen levels. The nuclear transcription factor Sp1 and arginase II evidence excess O-GlcNAcylation in HG cells. Expression in CF of an adenovirus coding for the enzyme N-acetylglucosaminidase, which removes O-GlcNAc moieties from proteins, decreased Sp1 and arginase II O-GlcNAcylation and restored HG-induced perturbations in CF back to NG levels. These findings may have important pathophysiological implications for the development of diabetes-induced cardiac fibrosis.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553187","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Cardiomyopathy","weight":0.771512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiomyopathy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.668255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.667473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.636922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.618366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.579425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.565761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.558915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.466132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Cystic fibrosis","weight":0.322903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Sp1 transcription factor","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp1_transcription_factor"},{"name":"SMAD (protein)","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMAD_(protein)"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.101002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cardiac fibrosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_fibrosis"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
