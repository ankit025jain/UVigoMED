{"id":62023,"title":"Diagnostic potential of antibody titres against Candida cell wall ?-glucan in Kawasaki disease.","abstract":"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis syndrome of unknown aetiology in children. The administration of Candida cell wall antigens induced KD-like coronary vasculitis in mice. However, the responses of KD patients to Candida cell wall antigen are unknown. In this study, we examined the response of KD patients to ?-glucan (BG), one of the major fungal cell wall antigens, by measuring the anti-BG titre. In KD patients, the anti-C.?albicans cell wall BG titre was higher than that in normal children. The anti-BG titre was also higher in KD patients compared to children who served as control subjects. The efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in KD is well established. We categorized the KD patients into three groups according to the therapeutic efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and compared the anti-BG titre among these groups. Anti-BG titres were similar in the control group and the non-responsive group. In the fully responsive group, the anti-BG titre showed higher values than those in the normal children. This study demonstrated clinically that KD patients have high antibody titres to Candida cell wall BG, and suggested the involvement of Candida cell wall BG in the pathogenesis of KD. The relationship between IVIG therapy and anti-BG titre was also shown. These results provide valuable insights into the therapy and diagnosis of KD.
