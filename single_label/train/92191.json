{"id":92191,"title":"Exploring implicit preventive strategies in prehospital emergency workers: a novel approach for preventing back problems.","abstract":"Back problems are a major occupational health issue for prehospital emergency care professionals. The goals of this article are to: 1) provide descriptive data about the prevalence and the severity of lower back and upper back disorders in EMTs and paramedics; 2) identify some individual and collective strategies used by EMTs and paramedics to protect their health as they perform prehospital emergency missions; 3) assess the possible effectiveness of strategies in preventing back problems by exploring associations between the use of strategies and the presence and severity of symptoms.The method includes a questionnaire survey (sample n = 334; paramedics and emergency medical technicians) and ergonomics work practice analysis involving shadowing ambulance crews in 12 medical emergency services (over 400 h).A majority of ambulance professionals had experienced back pain in the twelve-month period before the survey. Work practice analysis revealed strategies and tricks of the trade used by ambulance professionals to reduce the chances of back strain while working. Multiple regression analyses showed that self-reported use of such strategies was associated with fewer back symptoms.Preventive strategies should be integrated into specialised training programs for prehospital medical emergency professionals. This approach could also be used in other work settings.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439126","annotations":[{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.748303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Ambulance","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Emergency medical technician","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician"},{"name":"Paramedic","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic"},{"name":"Emergency medicine","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Emergency service","weight":0.679559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.654891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.468345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.461506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.401005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Technician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technician"},{"name":"Strain (injury)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(injury)"},{"name":"Trade","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
