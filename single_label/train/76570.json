{"id":76570,"title":"Sodium balance and the dysnatremias.","abstract":"The dysnatremias are defined as abnormalities in serum sodium concentration. Depending on the magnitude and duration of the sodium abnormality and the nature of any concurrent or primary disease, hypernatremia and hypernatremia may result in no consequences, subclinical impairment of health and productivity, or severe clinical disease. Dysnatremias can be the sequelae to diseases or environmental conditions that promote fluid gain or loss from the body, as well as medical interventions that add excessive amounts of sodium or water to the extracellular fluid. Extreme, sustained dysnatremia may result in central nervous system dysfunction and death.
