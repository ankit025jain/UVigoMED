{"id":78461,"title":"Does treatment interruption and baseline hemoglobin affect overall survival in early laryngeal cancer treated with radical radiotherapy? 10 years follow up.","abstract":"In this retrospective study we assessed different factors affecting the outcome of early laryngeal cancer, focusing on the impact of the pretreatment hemoglobin (Hb) level, time interval between diagnosis and start of radiotherapy, as well as treatment interruption during the course of radiotherapy.We reviewed the hospital records, oncology database and radiotherapy treatment sheets of 88 patients with T1-T3 N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx who had been treated with radical radiotherapy at Northamptonshire Centre for Oncology during the period from 1st January 1996 till 31st December 2002 inclusive. Patients were followed up for 10 years.There were no significant overall survival differences with regard to sex , stage, radiotherapy dose received, treatment interruption for 1 to 2 days , as well as the delay to start radiotherapy (mean delay 57 days). However, there was statistically significant adverse overall survival outcome with increasing age (p<0.001). On the other hand, patients with pretreatment Hb level >12 g/dl had significant statistical overall survival benefit over those with ?12 g/dl (p=0.018).Pretreatment Hb level had a significant impact on overall survival in patients with early laryngeal carcinoma treated with radical radiotherapy. Time to start radiation treatment, treatment interruption for 1 or 2 days and different dose / fractionations did not affect the overall survival.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24659653","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.827477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.803284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.770915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.428122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.405271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.380921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.313812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.25753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Northamptonshire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northamptonshire"},{"name":"Dirasha language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirasha_language"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0227032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Centre (French region)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(French_region)"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"M0 motorway (Hungary)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M0_motorway_(Hungary)"}]}
