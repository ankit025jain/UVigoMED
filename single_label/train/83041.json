{"id":83041,"title":"Circulating undercarboxylated osteocalcin and gingival crevicular fluid tumour necrosis factor-? in children.","abstract":"Osteocalcin, a protein secreted by osteoblasts during bone formation, is negatively associated with adult periodontal disease. Little is known about this association in children.To examine the extent to which plasma undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) is associated with gingival crevicular fluid tumour necrosis factor-alpha (GCF TNF-?) - a potential marker of gingival inflammation - in children.We used data from the Quebec Adipose and Lifestyle InvesTigation in Youth cohort, an ongoing longitudinal study on the natural history of obesity among Caucasian children with a family history of obesity in Quebec, Canada. This cross-sectional analysis from the baseline visit includes 120 children aged 8-10Â years. Plasma ucOC and GCF TNF-? levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Linear regression analyses, adjusting for age, gender, family income, sexual maturity stage, daily physical activity, obesity, and fasting glucose were conducted, with TNF-? level as the dependent variable.A 1-ng/ml increase in ucOC was associated with a 0.96% decrease (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.69, -0.23) in GCF TNF-? level.A negative association between a marker of bone formation and a marker of gingival inflammation was observed as early as childhood among Caucasian children with a family history of obesity.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Stomatognathic
