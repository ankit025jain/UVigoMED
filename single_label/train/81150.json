{"id":81150,"title":"Disposition of amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine in HIV-infected Nigerian subjects on nevirapine-containing antiretroviral therapy.","abstract":"Artesunate plus amodiaquine is used for malaria treatment in regions with overlapping HIV endemicity. Co-administration of artesunate/amodiaquine with antiretroviral therapy (ART) may result in drug-drug interactions, but minimal data exist. This study evaluated the impact of nevirapine-based ART, containing a backbone of zidovudine and lamivudine, on the disposition of amodiaquine and its active metabolite, desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ).This was an open-label, parallel-group pharmacokinetic comparison between HIV-infected, adult subjects receiving steady-state nevirapine-based ART (n = 10) and ART-naive subjects (control group, n = 11). All subjects received a loose formulation of artesunate/amodiaquine (200/600 mg) daily for 3 days, with serial pharmacokinetic sampling over 96 h following the final dose of artesunate/amodiaquine. Amodiaquine and DEAQ were quantified using a validated HPLC method with UV detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods.Exposures to both amodiaquine and DEAQ were significantly lower in the nevirapine-based ART group compared with the control group (amodiaquine AUC???? 145 versus 204 ng·h/mL, P = 0.02; DEAQ AUC???? 14,571 versus 21,648 ng·h/mL, P < 0.01). The AUCDEAQ/AUC(amodiaquine) ratio was not different between groups (ART group 116 versus control group 102, P = 0.67).Subjects on nevirapine-based ART had lower exposure to both amodiaquine and DEAQ (28.9% and 32.7%, respectively). Consequently, this may negatively impact the effectiveness of artesunate/amodiaquine in HIV-infected individuals on this ART combination.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24446424","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.929752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.912945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.816705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Zidovudine","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zidovudine"},{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.508257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.451011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.447279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.446933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.27628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.253382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"Amodiaquine","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amodiaquine"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Artesunate","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artesunate"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"648","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/648"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Disposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
