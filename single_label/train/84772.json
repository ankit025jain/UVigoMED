{"id":84772,"title":"Ceramic on ceramic hip prostheses: a review of past and modern materials.","abstract":"Ceramic on ceramic hip prostheses are an increasingly popular choice for hip replacement. Modern manufacturing techniques and developments have increased the strength and reliability of ceramic materials. The alternative bearing couples such as metal-on-polyethylene and metal-on-metal are more inclined to wear and produce particulate debris. Despite reports of fractures and stripe wear, harder, more inert and more wear resistant, modern ceramic-ceramic hip replacements provide a strong alternative to traditional bearings.
