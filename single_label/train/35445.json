{"id":35445,"title":"Tumors perturbing extracellular matrix biosynthesis. The case of von Recklinghausen's disease.","abstract":"This is a short review of neurofibromatosis-1 or von Recklinghausen's disease, due to a loss of function mutation of the gene neurofibromin-1, which normally inhibits the Ras MAPK-pathways. Among its symptoms, the strong oversynthesis of several collagen types designates this disease as producing a deregulation of extracellular matrix biosynthesis involved in tumor formation. Up to about 40% of the skin tumors consist of collagens. A short summary of the clinical manifestations and pathological and genetic mechanisms are also described.
