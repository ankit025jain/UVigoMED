{"id":62757,"title":"A benzophenanthridine alkaloid, chelerythrine induces apoptosis in vitro in a Dalton's lymphoma.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chelerythrine on DL cell apoptosis in an in vitro experimental setup.For tumor model, spontaneous occurring T-cell lymphoma designated as Dalton's lymphoma (DL) was selected. Double staining, transmission electron microscope (TEM), fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction, and DNA fragmentation assay were used to detect heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and hsp70 expression and PKC phosphorylation, and apoptotic characteristic of DL cells.Chelerythrine exposure resulted in significant morphological alteration comparable to that of apoptosis. Furthermore, it was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, TEM analysis, and DNA fragmentation assay that 10 ?g/mL of chelerythrine is capable of inducing apoptosis in DL cells. The suppression in HSF1 expression and subsequent inhibition of hsp70 expression in chelerythrine-treated DL cells suggest that chelerythrine induces apoptosis in DL cells by inhibiting the expression of these cytoprotective proteins.Chelerythrine is capable of inducing apoptosis DL cells in vitro and therefore, it could be useful in combating tumor growth and progression.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
