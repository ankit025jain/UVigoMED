{"id":72313,"title":"Tubular breast cancer. A retrospective study.","abstract":"The well-characterized tubular-type of breast tumors is classified as low-risk breast cancer.We report on the results of a retrospective analysis on clinical and biological features of 248 tubular breast tumors including follow-up and treatment data from two German series of 21,065 breast cancer cases. The majority of tumors were stage I or stage II, ER- and PR-positive and c-erbB2-negative with a 5-year survival-rate of 96.3%. 51.3% of patients received hormonal treatment, 75.5% had post-operative radiotherapy and 11.8% were treated with a chemotherapeutical regimen.Our retrospective analysis showed no treatment benefit for either anti-hormonal or chemotherapeutical regimens. Post-operative radiotherapy, however, improved the survival rate of patients with tubular carcinoma (log-rank=5, p=0.025). Our data suggest that post-operative radiotherapy is an important treatment to prolong survival for patients suffering from tubular breast cancer.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982382","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.59798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.558237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.436682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"ER (TV series)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/248"},{"name":"Cylinder (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(geometry)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.0158952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"German Formula Three Championship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Formula_Three_Championship"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
