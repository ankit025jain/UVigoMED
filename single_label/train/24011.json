{"id":24011,"title":"Tigecycline susceptibility in multidrug resistant Acinetobacter isolates from Turkey.","abstract":"The present study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial activity of tigecydcline against 84 multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter spp. strains by disc diffusion and E-test methods. The results of disc diffusion test were compared according to two different interpretation ways. In addition, E-test results and the disc diffusion results that interpreted by both the methods were checked for compatibility. According to the disc diffusion test, 3 strains (3.57%) were found resistant to tigecycline when considering breakpoints suggested by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On the other hand, none of the strains was found resistant to the evaluation criteria recommended by Jones etal. (2007). Considering E-test results of tigecycline, MIC, and MICG, values of tigecycline for Acinetobacter spp. were 0.75 and 1 mg/l, respectively. Based on FDA defined breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae, any resistant isolate was detected. In conclusion, although there are some differences in the results, tigecycline was found quite effective on Acinetobacter spp. isolates with reference to the both disc diffusion and the E-test methods.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459835","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.737179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.433093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.286254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Tigecycline","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigecycline"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0179148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Breakpoint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
