{"id":86996,"title":"Natural vertical transmission of dengue-1 virus in Aedes aegypti populations in Acapulco, Mexico.","abstract":"We carried out dengue virus surveillance in Aedes aegypti populations from 47 neighborhoods of Acapulco during the rainy season of 2011 following a standard national protocol and as an improvement of the entomological surveillance of the Mexican Dengue Control Program. A total of 4,146 Ae. aegypti adults collected indoors and/or emerged from eggs, larvae, or pupae from households with dengue reports (probable or confirmed cases), were grouped into pools and processed using a standardized serotype-specific 4-plex real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Overall, only 2 (0.9%) of 226 pools of Ae. aegypti adults (1 pool of adults emerged from field-collected larvae, and another of indoor-collected adults) were positive for dengue virus 1 (DENV-1). This is appears to be the 1st report of evidence on the vertical and transovarial transmission of DENV-1 in field-caught Ae. aegypti in Mexico.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102601","annotations":[{"name":"Virus","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.539484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Pupa","weight":0.313444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa"},{"name":"Vertical transmission","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_transmission"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.309191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Aedes aegypti","weight":0.215403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.176462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Entomology","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomology"},{"name":"Aedes","weight":0.109482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Wet season","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season"},{"name":"Acapulco","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acapulco"},{"name":"Denver Gold","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Gold"},{"name":"Dengue virus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_virus"},{"name":"Transovarial transmission","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transovarial_transmission"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Neighbourhood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Flag","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Chain store","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_store"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ae, Scotland","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ae,_Scotland"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"2011 Major League Baseball season","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Major_League_Baseball_season"}]}
