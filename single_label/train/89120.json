{"id":89120,"title":"[Whole esophagus deep burns with a metal foreign body in the stomach: a case report].","abstract":"Whole esophagus deep burn is an extremely rare upper gastrointestinal tract disease. We report a case of severe burns of involving extensive body skin, eyes, throat, and esophagus. Endoscopic examination revealed acute necrotizing esophagitis and detected a metal foreign body in the stomach. The patient underwent burn wound debridement with analgesia, anti-shock rehydration, anti-infection, and symptomatic treatments, which failed to improve the conditions. The patient died of respiratory and circulatory failure secondary to serious sepsis.
