{"id":46943,"title":"Consumption of fruit, but not vegetables, may reduce risk of gastric cancer: results from a meta-analysis of cohort studies.","abstract":"Quantification of the association between consumption of fruit and vegetables and risk of gastric cancer (GC) is controversial. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of cohort studies to evaluate the associations.Eligible studies published up to 31st August 2013 were retrieved via both computer searches of PubMed and EMBASE and a manual review of references. Random-effects models were used to calculate summary relative risk (SRR). Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran's Q and I(2) statistics.A total of 17 articles (24 studies), were included in this meta-analysis. There were >2.4 million individuals (6632 GC events) with a median follow-up of 10years. Based on the high versus low analysis, consumption of fruit, but not vegetables, may reduce risk of gastric cancer (fruit: SRR=0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-0.98, Pheterogeneity=0.450; vegetable: SRR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.88-1.06, Pheterogeneity=0.150). Meta regression analysis suggested that outcome (incidence versus mortality) and study quality (high versus low) contributed significantly to heterogeneity. The same results were also shown in the linear dose-response analysis (per 100-g/day) (fruit: SRR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99; vegetable: SRR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.01). Significant inverse associations emerged in non-linear models for consumption of fruit (Pnon-linearity=0.04), but not for consumption of vegetables (Pnon-linearity=0.551).Findings from this meta-analysis indicate a significant protective effect for the consumption of fruit on GC risk, but not for the consumption of vegetables.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613128","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.9065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.775044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.753797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.567805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.563986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.478888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.441246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.417666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.411965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.358296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Nonlinear regression","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_regression"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"August 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_31"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"830","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/830"},{"name":"881","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/881"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"910","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/910"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Multiplicative inverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_inverse"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Split-ring resonator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-ring_resonator"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Radiation hormesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hormesis"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
