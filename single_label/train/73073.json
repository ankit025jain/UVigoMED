{"id":73073,"title":"The 20-year effort to reduce access to mammography screening: historical facts dispute a commentary in Cancer.","abstract":"Mammography screening fulfills all requirements for an effective screening test. It detects many cancers earlier when they are at a smaller size and earlier stage, and it has been demonstrated that this reduces breast cancer deaths in randomized controlled trials. When screening is introduced into the population, the death rate from breast cancer declines. Nevertheless, scientifically unsupported arguments that appear in the medical literature are passed on to the public and continue to confuse women and physicians regarding the value of screening. Methodologically flawed challenges to mammography have been almost continuous since the 1990s. And, as each challenge has been invalidated, a new, specious challenge has been raised. The authors of this report address the long history of misinformation that has developed in the effort to reduce access to screening, and they address the issues raised by commentators concerning their recent publication in this journal.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925233","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.702805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"History","weight":0.579468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.536827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.311587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.225141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.167876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0594293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Academic journal","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal"},{"name":"1990s","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"1990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990"},{"name":"Shilling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling"},{"name":"Sports commentator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator"},{"name":"Misinformation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation"}]}
