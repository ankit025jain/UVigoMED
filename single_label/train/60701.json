{"id":60701,"title":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.","abstract":"Abstract A summary of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is presented. HIT is an adverse drug reaction characterized by thrombocytopenia and a high risk for venous or arterial thrombosis. The frequency of HIT ranges from 1 to 5% of patients receiving heparin with exact frequencies ranging between specific agents. Interestingly, this immune-mediated syndrome is ironically associated with thrombosis, not bleeding, with thrombin formation playing a major role. It is caused by heparin-dependent, platelet-activating antibodies that identifies a self-protein, PF4, bound to heparin that results in an antibody formation. The resulting platelet activation is associated with increased thrombin generation. Typically, the platelet count fall begins 5-10 days after starting heparin, although a rapid platelet count fall can occur in a patient who has antibodies from recent heparin use. Typical causes of HIT as well as the best diagnostic studies and treatment are discussed in this review. HIT was reviewed using a pubmed™ search; google scholar™ using key words: \"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia\"; \"heparin\", and \"drug AND thrombocytopenia.\" ","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844576","annotations":[{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.796806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.750124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.739817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.721179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.66088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0263793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"},{"name":"Keyword (linguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Irony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony"},{"name":"Platelet factor 4","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_factor_4"},{"name":"Scholar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"}]}
