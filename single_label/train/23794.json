{"id":23794,"title":"Predictors and outcomes of Candida bloodstream infection: eight-year surveillance, western Saudi Arabia.","abstract":"To assess the epidemiological pattern of Candida bloodstream infection (BSI) over an 8-year period (2002-2009) in King Abdulaziz Medical City, western Saudi Arabia.A retrospective chart review was performed.A total of 258 BSI were identified in 134 males (53.2%) and 118 females (46.8%). There were 86 (34.1%) cases of Candida albicans and 166 (65.9%) non-albicans Candida species. Malignancy was independently associated with the development of candidemia by non-albicans Candida species (odds ratio 3.24, 95% confidence interval 1.25-8.41). Fluconazole in vitro susceptibility was 38.5% for C. albicans and 52.5% for other Candida species. The overall, crude 12-month mortality rate was 50% for C. albicans and 57.8% for non-albicans Candida species.The antifungal resistance coinciding with a change in the epidemiologic pattern of candidemia identified in this study is alarming and urges the need for a review of empiric antifungal therapy and potential contributing environmental factors.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468816","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.918735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.880877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.647207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.569683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.490147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Saudi Arabia","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.371385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Fungemia","weight":0.370962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungemia"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.276288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.273033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Arabian Peninsula","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"258","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/258"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud_of_Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Monarch","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Medical City Dallas Hospital","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_City_Dallas_Hospital"},{"name":"BSI Group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSI_Group"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
