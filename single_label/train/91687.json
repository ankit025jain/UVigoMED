{"id":91687,"title":"[Paradigm shift in the management of metastatic epidural spinal cord compression: the importance of preserving ambulation].","abstract":"In 2005, a Landmark study showed that direct decompressive surgery, followed by postoperative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is superior to EBRT alone in patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC). Patients undergoing both surgery and EBRT had similar median survival but experienced longer ambulation than with EBRT alone. Additional studies have shown improvements in quality-of-life, higher cost-effectiveness, improved pain control, and higher functional status with surgery plus EBRT. Improved neurological outcome also improved the patients' ability to undergo postoperative adjuvant therapy. According to our experience, even patients over 65 or patients with aggressive primary tumors and additional metastases have benefited from surgical intervention, living longer than expected with preservation of ambulation and sphincter control until death or shortly before. Preserving ambulation is critical. With current surgical devices and techniques, patients with MESCC who present with a single area of cord compression, back pain, neurological deficit, or progressive deformity, may benefit from surgery prior to adjuvant radiation-based treatment or chemotherapy.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482995","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"Epidural","weight":0.81461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Spinal cord compression","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_compression"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.409082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.323438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.31147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.28582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Landmark","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark"}]}
