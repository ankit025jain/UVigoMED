The results of MALBAC sequencing were compared with the results of CGH and SNP. The chromosomal status and occurrence of the abnormal chromosomes were investigated. The relationship between the embryos' morphology and the euploid state was analyzed.Among the 23 donated embryos, the MALBAC sequencing results of 18 (78.26%) embryos were identical to those of CGH or SNP, including 8 embryos that had identical results by all three techniques. In terms of euploidy, only 6 of these 23 embryos (26.09%) were diploid. Blastomere abnormality was observed in all autosomes and sex chromosomes. In addition, the frequency of abnormality was different for certain chromosomes.With sequencing at 0.04Ã— genome depth, MALBAC sequencing has been validated as a satisfactory method for 24-chromosome aneuploidy screening. The proportion of abnormal chromosomes was high in cleavage-stage embryos, and any chromosome could be abnormal.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241375","annotations":[{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Diploid","weight":0.883257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid"},{"name":"Blastomere","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastomere"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.837157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.819178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Ploidy","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy"},{"name":"Comparative genomic hybridization","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.792843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Sex-determination system","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.723615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.556958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cleavage (embryo)","weight":0.527585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(embryo)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid thermodynamics","weight":0.511058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_thermodynamics"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.338059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.21971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Embryo donation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_donation"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"}]}
