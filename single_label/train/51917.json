{"id":51917,"title":"Evidence for decreased expression of ADAMTS-1 associated with impaired oocyte quality in PCOS patients.","abstract":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of dysfunctional ovulation-affecting female fertility. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motifs (ADAMTS-1) is required for normal ovulation and subsequent fertilization, and the expression of ADAMTS-1 may be altered in PCOS granulosa cell (GC)-reflecting abnormalities in ovulatory signaling.The purpose of this paper is to analyze the differential expression of ADAMTS-1 in PCOS patients associated with impaired oocyte quality.A prospective comparative experimental study was performed at a clinical reproductive medicine center.Women with PCOS (n = 40) and normovulatory controls (n = 40) undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and in vitro fertilization were recruited in our study.Differential expression of ADAMTS-1 in GCs was analyzed with immunocytochemistry in PCOS patients and normal controls, and ADAMTS-1 mRNA expression was quantified by RT-PCR. Furthermore, the correlation between ADAMTS-1 mRNA and oocyte quality was analyzed.The expression of ADAMTS-1 was decreased in PCOS patients compared with normally ovulating women and was closely related to lower oocyte recovery, oocyte maturity, and fertilization rate.Our study provides evidence that the dysregulated expression of ADAMTS-1 in PCOS may influence oocyte quality-via GCs-oocyte paracrine and endocrine mechanism.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646063","annotations":[{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Granulosa cell","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulosa_cell"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Ovulation","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.774117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.74024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Sexual maturity","weight":0.604585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Reproductive medicine","weight":0.39111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_medicine"},{"name":"Ovarian hyperstimulation","weight":0.300394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_hyperstimulation"},{"name":"Paracrine signalling","weight":0.275845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracrine_signalling"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.254398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"}]}
