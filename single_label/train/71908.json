{"id":71908,"title":"Integrin ?E?7: molecular features and functional significance in the immune system.","abstract":"Alpha E beta 7 (?E?7) is an ?-I domain-containing integrin that is highly expressed by a variety of leukocyte populations at mucosal sites including intraepithelial T cells, dendritic cells, mast cells, and T regulatory cells (Treg). Expression depends largely or solely on transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) isoforms. The best characterized ligand for ?E?7 is E-cadherin on epithelial cells, though there is evidence of a second ligand in the human system. An exposed acidic residue on the distal aspect of E-cadherin domain 1 interacts with the MIDAS site in the ?E ?-I domain. By binding to E-cadherin, ?E?7 contributes to mucosal specific retention of leukocytes within epithelia. Studies on ?E knockout mice have identified an additional important function for this integrin in allograft rejection and have also indicated that it may have a role in immunoregulation. Recent studies point to a multifaceted role for ?E?7 in regulating both innate and acquired immune responses to foreign antigen.
