{"id":88301,"title":"Maxillofacial and concomitant injuries in multiple injured patients at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana.","abstract":"Patients with maxillofacial injuries may sustain concomitant injuries. The presentation of other injuries may be the initial focus of attention of the primary attending surgeon who may miss the maxillofacial injuries to the detriment of the patient.To determine the incidence of injuries associated with maxillofacial injuries at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) from January 2009 to December 2010.A prospective study was carried out on patients who were referred to the Maxillofacial Unit of the University of Ghana Dental School and KBTH over the two years with maxillofacial injuries. Their age, sex, type of injury in the maxillofacial region, its aetiology and concomitant injuries were charted. The data was analysed using SPSS 16.0 software.Two hundred and fifty eight (258) patients were seen of which 67 (26.0%) had concomitant injuries. The average age was 29.1 years. The peak incidence was in the age group 21-30 (N=73, 28.3%). 74% were male and 26.0% female. The commonest cause of injury was road traffic accident (RTA) (N=142;55.0%). 52.7% (N=136) of the patients had injuries of the maxillofacial region. 26.7% (N=69) had mandibular fractures, 19.4% (N=50) had middle third fractures and 8.1% (N=21) had fractures of both. Concomitant injuries were mainly orthopaedic (N=31;12%) and the head and spinal region (N=29;11.2%).A significant number of patients who suffer maxillofacial injuries also sustain injuries of other parts of the body at KBTH. Prompt multidisciplinary management may contribute to improved outcomes.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872267","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.424104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.368692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.276029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Ghana","weight":0.192395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.0538916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"University of Ghana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ghana"},{"name":"N21 road (Ireland)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N21_road_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Korle Bu Teaching Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korle_Bu_Teaching_Hospital"},{"name":"London Buses route N136","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Buses_route_N136"},{"name":"N69 road (Ireland)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N69_road_(Ireland)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"L.
