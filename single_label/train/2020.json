{"id":2020,"title":"[The clinical application of 13C-breath tests in pancreatic diseases].","abstract":"Maldigestion persists in most patients with chronic pancreatitis (GP). The objective lipase and amylase insufficiency diagnosis is needed to achieve an adequate clinical response to oral pancreatic enzyme substitution therapy. The novel data is presented in the article about the role of 13C-mixed triglyceride and 13C-corn starch breath tests as a tools for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency diagnosis, for evaluating fat and starch malabsorbtion in CP patients. 135 patients were included in the investigation. It has been shown, that 13C-breath tests could be useful tools in clinical practice for CP diagnosis. They are well correlate with fecal elastase-1 level, has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of lipase and amylase deficiency. Tests make it possible to choose the initial pancreatic enzyme dosage and are beneficial during the treatment for pancreatic enzyme dose correction.","date":"2014-12-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528838","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Amylase","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylase"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.813144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Lipase","weight":0.716289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.660996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Starch","weight":0.649777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch"},{"name":"Exocrine gland","weight":0.627111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_gland"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.550455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.419691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Elastase","weight":0.304438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastase"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_pancreatic_insufficiency"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Exocrine component of pancreas","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocrine_component_of_pancreas"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Breath test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_test"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
