{"id":85029,"title":"Two studies on reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression by BK-channel blocker GAL021 in human volunteers.","abstract":"Opioid-induced respiratory depression is potentially lethal. GAL021 is a calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channel blocker that causes reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in animals due to a stimulatory effect on ventilation at the carotid bodies. To assess in humans whether GAL021 stimulates breathing in established opioid-induced respiratory depression and to evaluate its safety, a proof-of-concept double-blind randomized controlled crossover study on isohypercapnic ventilation (study 1) and subsequent double-blind exploratory study on poikilocapnic ventilation and nonrespiratory end points (study 2) was performed.In study 1, intravenous low- and high-dose GAL021 and placebo were administrated on top of low- and high-dose alfentanil-induced respiratory depression in 12 healthy male volunteers on two separate occasions. In study 2, the effect of GAL021/placebo on poikilocapnic ventilation, analgesia, and sedation were explored in eight male volunteers. Data are mean difference between GAL021 and placebo (95% CI).Study 1: Under isohypercapnic conditions, a separation between GAL021 and placebo on minute ventilation was observed by 6.1 (3.6 to 8.6) l/min (P < 0.01) and 3.6 (1.5 to 5.7) l/min (P < 0.01) at low-dose alfentanil plus high-dose GAL021 and high-dose-alfentanil plus high-dose GAL021, respectively. Study 2: Similar observations were made on poikilocapnic ventilation and arterial pCO2. GAL021 had no effect on alfentanil-induced sedation, antinociception and no safety issues or hemodynamic effects became apparent.GAL021 produces respiratory stimulatory effects during opioid-induced respiratory depression with containment of opioid-analgesia and without any further increase of sedation. Further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary data.","date":"2014-09-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25222672","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoventilation","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoventilation"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.740782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.722342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.697668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.670478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.520552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.512807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.489497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Inhalation","weight":0.485244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.375523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Carotid body","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_body"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.245833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.219121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0630736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Alfentanil","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfentanil"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Respiratory minute volume","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_minute_volume"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Containment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_blocker"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"}]}
