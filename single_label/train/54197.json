{"id":54197,"title":"Two cases of primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy.","abstract":"Two women suffering from primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy are presented. Patient 1 with a history of four miscarriages, an ectopic pregnancy and a sixth pregnancy complicated by severe early onset preeclampsia. She was found to have high serum Ca(2+) levels after delivery and parathyroid adenoma was diagnosed by ultrasound. A right inferior parathyroidectomy was performed. Patient 2 with a history of high serum Ca(2+) and generalised symptoms of hypercalcaemia. Ultrasound did not reveal adenoma but an elective neck exploration was performed in light of the abnormal blood results. The right inferior parathyroid gland was excised and histology confirmed the presence of adenoma. These cases help highlight the different ways in which primary hyperparathyroidism can present and the barriers to diagnosis in pregnancy. Various potential complications (including miscarriage and preeclampsia) are explored and the appropriateness of surgical treatment during pregnancy is emphasised.
