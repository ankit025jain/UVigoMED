{"id":68418,"title":"Histologic phenotype on 1-year posttransplantation biopsy and allograft survival in HLA-incompatible kidney transplants.","abstract":"The correlation between histopathologic phenotypes and allograft outcomes among patients desensitized for donor-specific antibody (HLA-incompatible) is unknown.We analyzed 1-year biopsies from desensitized recipients transplanted between 1999 and 2010 and estimated graft survival for each histologic phenotype identified. Median time posttransplant for the 1-year biopsy was 367 days (interquartile range 357-388 days) and median follow-up of all patients post-1-year biopsy was 42 months (interquartile range 19.5-65 months).Transplant glomerulopathy was present in 25.0% of biopsies and resulted in worse graft survival (66.7% vs. 96.7%, P<0.001). C4d positivity and transplant glomerulopathy together portended exceptionally poor graft survival (33.3% vs. 97.2%, P<0.001). Microcirculation inflammation was prevalent, with glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis found in 60.0% and 47.6% of 1-year biopsies, respectively. Glomerulitis was associated with worse graft survival (82.1% vs. 98.1%, P=0.004), whereas capillaritis was not (88.1% vs. 97.7% respectively, P=0.091). Among C4d-negative HLA-incompatible recipients (82.6% of biopsies), no difference in graft survival was observed between patients with or without microcirculation inflammation in contrast to previous reports by other investigators. Patients who had no C4d deposition, transplant glomerulopathy, or microcirculation inflammation had a 100.0% graft survival. On Cox regression analysis, no independent histopathological parameter was associated with graft survival.We have identified several histopathologic phenotypes in HLA-incompatible kidney recipients that correlate with allograft outcomes. Characterization of these phenotypes is the first step towards better understanding the pathophysiologic basis of chronic antibody-mediated allograft injury and individualizing therapeutic intervention.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521779","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.755037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.740695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.716079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.712532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.574772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.151952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Channel 4","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Minuscule 565","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_565"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Penny (British pre-decimal coin)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(British_pre-decimal_coin)"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Desensitization (psychology)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_(psychology)"}]}
