{"id":82454,"title":"Hemangioblastoma arising from the submandibular gland.","abstract":"The objective was to document and describe the clinical features of a hemangioblastoma arising from a submandibular gland.A case report of a 63-year-old man with a right submandibular gland hemangioblastoma.Submandibular gland excision and histological examination revealed a hemangioblastoma. Subsequent evaluation with imaging studies found no association with von Hippel-Lindau disease.We report the first presentation of a hemangioblastoma arising in a salivary gland. Further evaluation of patients with a hemangioblastoma is recommended given the neoplasms' association with von Hippel-Lindau disease.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623019","annotations":[{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.717057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.472467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.36434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.276722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hemangioblastoma","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioblastoma"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Submandibular gland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submandibular_gland"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
