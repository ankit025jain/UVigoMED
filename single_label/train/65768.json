{"id":65768,"title":"Sperm retrieval and quality evaluation.","abstract":"Technical refinements in sperm retrieval methods and the application of advanced reproductive technologies (ART) using surgically retrieved sperm have enabled biological paternity in azoospermic men who were considered untreatable 20 years ago. Achievement of optimal reproductive outcomes in these patients benefits greatly from a multistep, interdisciplinary process of sperm acquisition that involves reproductive endocrinologists, urologists, or other specialists in male subfertility, and laboratory personnel with expertise in characterizing and isolating sperm from surgically retrieved specimens. The critical steps in this process are discussed in this chapter.
