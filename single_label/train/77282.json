{"id":77282,"title":"Is complementary and alternative medicine effective in job satisfaction among dentists with musculoskeletal disorders? A cross sectional study.","abstract":"Musculoskeletal disorders have serious impact on the profession of dentistry. There is common occurrence of pain due to incorrect posture in dental professionals. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies may cast a new light on preventing and intercepting musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). An epidemiological study was conducted in an effort to contribute to the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders in dentistry. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of MSD at dentists using CAM as a treatment and preventive modality for MSD and to compare job/career satisfaction between dentists who use CAM and conventional therapy (CT).Dentists registered in Uttrakhand state, India, under the Dental Council of India and registered members of the Indian Dental Association, Uttrakhand branch (N = 1496) were surveyed. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 17.A response rate of 84% (N = 1257) was obtained, revealing that 90% (N = 1131) had the problem of MSD. Seventy three percentage (N = 826) of dentists with MSD reported the use of CAM and CT. Complementary and alternative medicine users reported greater overall health (72.7% vs. 51%, p < 0.001), job satisfaction (61.2% vs. 35%, p < 0.001) and work efficiency compared to CT users.Complementary and alternative medicine therapies may improve quality of life, reduce work interruption and enhance job satisfaction for dentists who suffers from MSD. Through the course of their studies, dentists should be equipped with knowledge on ergonomics and CAM therapies, such as yoga and others, to help them prevent musculoskeletal disorders more effectively.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230560","annotations":[{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.872543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Yoga","weight":0.662401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"India","weight":0.651464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.606368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.60503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.599862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.596476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.484501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.295016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.232234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Dental Council of India","weight":0.17995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_Council_of_India"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"Branch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Cast iron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"}]}
