{"id":34538,"title":"Anomalies associated with gastroschisis and omphalocele: analysis of 2825 cases from the Texas Birth Defects Registry.","abstract":"The increasing prevalence of abdominal wall defects prompted analysis of anomalies associated with gastroschisis and omphalocele in the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TDBR).Cases of gastroschisis (ICD9 code 756.71), omphalocele (756.70), and/or unspecified anomalies of the abdominal wall (756.79) were obtained from the TDBR after IRB approval and analyzed using Microsoft Access© and Excel© databases.Analysis began with 2825 cases including 1831 of gastroschisis, 814 of omphalocele, and 180 of unspecified abdominal wall defects plus 9680 associated anomalies that were classified according to system. The overall prevalence of abdominal wall defects among 3,806,299 Texas births from 1999 to 2008 was 7.4 per 10,000 with 4.8 per 10,000 for gastroschisis and 2.1 for omphalocele. After excluding ambiguous cases (8.5% possibly misclassified), anomaly spectra were similar for the two AWD with musculoskeletal (limb contractures or defects), cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and central nervous system defects being most common. Of 1831 cases with gastroschisis, 594 (32%) had associated anomalies compared to 654 (80%) of 814 omphalocele cases.Gastroschisis as well as omphalocele has significant associated anomalies that are important to appreciate during pre- and postnatal management.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
