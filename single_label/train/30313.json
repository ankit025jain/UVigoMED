{"id":30313,"title":"Severe alkalosis and hypokalemia with stanozolol misuse.","abstract":"Stanozolol is a popular androgenic anabolic steroid, used by body builders and athletes for physical performance enhancement. There are few data on its potential adverse effects and no documented cases of it causing severe electrolyte imbalance. Here, we report a patient presenting to a tertiary care emergency department with reduced conscious level, profound hypokalemia, and severe metabolic alkalosis, resulting from stanozolol misuse. This is the first such case reported.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521609","annotations":[{"name":"Anabolic steroid","weight":0.842577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.792856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.578734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.499244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Stanozolol","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanozolol"},{"name":"Anabolism","weight":0.358068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolism"},{"name":"Water-electrolyte imbalance","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water-electrolyte_imbalance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hypokalemia","weight":0.223912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemia"},{"name":"Bodybuilding","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilding"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.154334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_performance-enhancing_drugs_in_sport"},{"name":"Alkalosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalosis"},{"name":"Metabolic alkalosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_alkalosis"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
