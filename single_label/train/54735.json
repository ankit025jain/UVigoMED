{"id":54735,"title":"Success with single-agent immunosuppression for multifocal choroidopathies.","abstract":"To evaluate the success of single-agent immunosuppression for patients with the posterior uveitides, birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis, and punctate inner choroiditis.Retrospective case series.setting: Tertiary care uveitis practices. population: Patients initiated on immunomodulatory therapy. intervention: Patients were treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg and mycophenolate 2 g daily. Prednisone was tapered after 1 month. Immunosuppression was escalated to mycophenolate 3 g daily, with addition of a second agent, as needed, to achieve treatment success. outcome measure: Treatment success, defined as no disease activity with prednisone dose ?10 mg daily, at 6, 12, and 24 months.Twenty-seven patients were followed. Mean presentation and 2-year follow-up acuities were 20/41 and 20/42, respectively. For birdshot chorioretinitis, mean (±standard deviation) quantitative Goldmann visual field scores improved from 761 ± 69 degrees (IV/4 isopter) and 496 ± 115 degrees (I/4 isopter) at presentation to 784 ± 57 degrees and 564 ± 125 degrees, respectively. Prednisone was successfully tapered in 95% of patients; mean prednisone doses at 1 and 2 years were 5.3 ± 4.1 and 5.7 ± 4.8 mg/day, respectively. At 2 years, prednisone was discontinued in 11% of patients. Treatment success was achieved in 74% of patients on 1 immunosuppressant, and in an additional 21% of patients on 2 agents, for an overall 95% success rate at 2 years.Posterior uveitides can be treated with 1 agent in most patients, but the data suggest a need to escalate therapy to higher mycophenolate doses, and in one fifth of cases to add a second agent to maintain disease suppression with acceptably low prednisone doses.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25194229","annotations":[{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.812954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.671548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.529725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.527547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.469881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.401242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.209335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Shotgun","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Inline-four engine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-four_engine"},{"name":"Chorioretinitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorioretinitis"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Choroiditis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroiditis"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"761","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/761"},{"name":"784","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/784"},{"name":"2042","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2042"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Tapering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapering"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Goldmann (publisher)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldmann_(publisher)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
