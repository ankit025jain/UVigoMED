{"id":18846,"title":"Chytridiomycosis: a global threat to amphibians.","abstract":"Chytridiomycosis, which is caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is an emerging infectious disease of amphibians. The disease is one of the main causes of the global decline in amphibians. The aetiological agent is ubiquitous, with worldwide distribution, and affects a large number of amphibian species in several biomes. In the last decade, scientific research has substantially increased knowledge of the aetiological agent and the associated infection. However, important epidemiological aspects of the environment-mediated interactions between the aetiological agent and the host are not yet clear. The objective of the present review is to describe chytridiomycosis with regard to the major features of the aetiological agent, the host and the environment.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761737","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.60458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.575048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Amphibian","weight":0.488317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.359539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Biome","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.199404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Chytridiomycosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chytridiomycosis"},{"name":"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batrachochytrium_dendrobatidis"},{"name":"Emerging infectious disease","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_infectious_disease"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Omnipresence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipresence"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
