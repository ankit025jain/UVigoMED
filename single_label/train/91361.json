{"id":91361,"title":"Participation and quality of life of cognitively impaired older women in Israel following hip fractures.","abstract":"The main objective of this study was to identify the impact of cognitive problems on the participation and quality of life of individuals following hip fracture among senior women. Sixty women aged ?65?years after an operation due to a hip fracture, half with non-impaired cognition (average Mini Mental State Examination 27) and half with mild cognitive impairment (average Mini Mental State Examination 21) were examined and interviewed at admission to a rehabilitation hospital in Israel and 1?month after discharge with the following measures: Functional Independence Measure, Geriatric Depression Scale, Israeli Adults Assessment of Participation and questionnaire and 12-item short-form health status survey questionnaire. The average age was 83?years (SD?=?6.5), 63% were widows. No difference was found between those with and without cognitive impairment. A month after discharge, the average general participation score of the cognitively unimpaired women was 11.5, and of those with impaired cognition was 7.5 (p?>?0.001). Four participation subscales revealed significant differences between the two groups (homecare, physical exercise, self-care and quiet pastimes), and two subscales (going out and entertainment and enrichment activities) showed no significant differences. Quality of life was lower a month after discharge for both physical and mental components, with no differences between the two groups. Therefore, specific attention should be given to those with mild cognitive impairment during rehabilitation. It is recommended to practise the basic functions over and over as part of their re-adjustment to their new situation. Attention should also be given in order to improve their re-involvement in the community.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510895","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.724856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.414041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.399442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.370331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.322892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Attention","weight":0.302906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention"},{"name":"Entertainment","weight":0.292202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.263258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Home care","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.158256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.128503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Mild cognitive impairment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hobby","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby"},{"name":"Improvisational theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Widow","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widow"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"}]}
