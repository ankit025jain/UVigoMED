{"id":29712,"title":"Alcohol-attributable deaths and years of potential life lost--11 States, 2006-2010.","abstract":"Excessive alcohol consumption, the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States, resulted in approximately 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years of potential life lost (YPLL) annually during 2006-2010 and cost an estimated $223.5 billion in 2006. To estimate state-specific average annual rates of alcohol-attributable deaths (AAD) and YPLL caused by excessive alcohol use, 11 states analyzed 2006-2010 data (the most recent data available) using the CDC Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) application. The age-adjusted median AAD rate was 28.5 per 100,000 population (range = 50.9 per 100,000 in New Mexico to 22.4 per 100,000 in Utah). The median YPLL rate was 823 per 100,000 (range = 1,534 YPLL per 100,000 for New Mexico to 634 per 100,000 in Utah). The majority of AAD (median = 70%) and YPLL (median = 82%) were among working-age (20-64 years) adults. Routine monitoring of alcohol-attributable health outcomes, including deaths and YPLL, in states could support the planning and implementation of evidence-based prevention strategies recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force to reduce excessive drinking and related harms. Such strategies include increasing the price of alcohol, limiting alcohol outlet density, and holding alcohol retailers liable for harms related to the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors and intoxicated patrons (dram shop liability).","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622285","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"New Mexico","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.681613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.621473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Utah","weight":0.590704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.587838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.550591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.538604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.38582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"1000000000 (number)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number)"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.18028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.145929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Retail","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail"},{"name":"List of preventable causes of death","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_preventable_causes_of_death"},{"name":"Price","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Legal liability","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0551856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Patronage","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Drama","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"Years of potential life lost","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_potential_life_lost"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Task force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force"},{"name":"Rangeland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangeland"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
