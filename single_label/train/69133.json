{"id":69133,"title":"A solitary polypoid gastric metastasis 20 years after renal cell carcinoma: an event to be considered, and a brief review of the literature.","abstract":"The incidence of gastric metastasis is 2.6%. Although all primary neoplasms can metastasize to the stomach, most originate from melanoma or breast and lung cancer. Their most common endoscopic appearance is a \"volcano-like\" polypoid mass covered by normal mucosa that may show a central ulceration. Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, is known to spread hematogenously, and isolated metastasis to the stomach is a rare event.In this report, we describe a gastric recurrence of RCC, clear-cell type, in a 80-year-old patient who had undergone nephrectomy 20 years before. We also performed a brief review of the literature to update the number of cases described to date.Metastatic involvement of the stomach should be suspected in any patient with a previous history of renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms, even if many years after nephrectomy. The peculiarity of our case is due to the very late presentation of the gastric metastasis. Only two cases of very late gastric metastases from RCC, clear cell type, have been described in the literature, to date.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466764","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.802005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.783776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.365351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"}]}
