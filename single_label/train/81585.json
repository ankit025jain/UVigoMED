{"id":81585,"title":"Characterization of primary and permanent teeth using terahertz spectroscopy.","abstract":"To analyse teeth samples by using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system that was developed in the laboratory to measure the properties of sliced teeth sections in transmission mode.Using home-built THz-TDS system, we analysed a total of 25 teeth samples (9 primary and 16 permanent teeth). For transmission measurements, the refractive index and absorptive properties of the teeth sections were calculated. Difference between groups was tested using Mann-Whitney U-test statistics at the specific frequency of 0.5?THz, which was at the midpoint of the bandwidth. Median and minimum-maximum values were given as descriptive statistics. Type-I error rate was taken as ??=?0.05.Median refractive index values for permanent and primary teeth were found to be 2.53 and 2.54, respectively. Median absorption coefficient values for permanent and primary teeth were found to be 26.29 and 29.67, respectively. Median refractive index values for both healthy and carious teeth were found to be 2.54. Median absorption coefficient values for healthy and carious teeth were found to be 26.52 and 27.13, respectively. Although higher median absorption coefficient values were found for primary and carious teeth than those of permanent and healthy teeth, the differences were insignificant (p?>?0.05). In addition, no statistical differences were found for refractive index values among different groups (p?>?0.05).THz imaging has the potential to be used in assessing dental structures.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24940807","annotations":[{"name":"Refractive index","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.672261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Attenuation coefficient","weight":0.540019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation_coefficient"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.471731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Terahertz radiation","weight":0.358028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz_radiation"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.352013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.296132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.224233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Bandwidth (signal processing)","weight":0.169514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.128662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0565179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Bit error rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_error_rate"},{"name":"Sampling (signal processing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Midpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint"},{"name":"Transverse mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_mode"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Homebuilt aircraft","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebuilt_aircraft"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Transmission (telecommunications)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(telecommunications)"}]}
