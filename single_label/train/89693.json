{"id":89693,"title":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of hip fracture prevention with vitamin D supplementation: a Markov micro-simulation model applied to the French population over 65 years old without previous hip fracture.","abstract":"We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of four vitamin D supplementation strategies for primary prevention of hip fracture among the elderly population and found that the most cost-effective strategy was screening for vitamin D insufficiency followed by adequate treatment to attain a minimum 25(OH) serum level.Vitamin D supplementation has a demonstrated ability to reduce the incidence of hip fractures. The efficiency of lifetime supplementation has not yet been assessed in the population over 65 years without previous hip fracture. The objective was to analyze the efficiency of various vitamin D supplementation strategies for that population.A Markov micro-simulation model was built with data extracted from published studies and from the French reimbursement schedule. Four vitamin D supplementation strategies were evaluated on our study population: (1) no treatment, (2) supplementation without any serum level check; (3) supplementation with a serum level check 3 months after initiation and subsequent treatment adaptation; (4) population screening for vitamin D insufficiency followed by treatment based on the vitamin D serum level.\"Treat, then check\" and \"screen and treat\" were two cost-effective strategies and dominated \"treat without check\" with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of €5,219/quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and €9,104/QALY, respectively. The acceptability curves showed that over €6,000/QALY, the \"screen and treat\" strategy had the greatest probability of being cost-effective, and the \"no treatment\" strategy would never be cost-effective if society were willing to spend over €8,000/QALY. The sensitivity analysis showed that among all parameters varying within realistic ranges, the cost of vitamin D treatment had the greatest effect and yet remained below the WHO cost-effectiveness thresholds.Population screening for vitamin D insufficiency followed by treatment based on the vitamin D serum level is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing hip fracture occurrence in the population over 65 years old.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691648","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin
