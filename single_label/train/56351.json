{"id":56351,"title":"Not just a red eye.","abstract":"A 70-year-old woman presented to the Eye Casualty department with a 10-day history of worsening pain and redness in her right eye, associated with progressively reduced vision. History revealed that the patient had recently completed a course of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Anterior examination of the right eye revealed a vascularised iris mass causing pupillary distortion, intraocular inflammation and raised intraocular pressure. She was diagnosed with a right iris metastasis secondary to breast cancer. Ocular management consisted of topical steroids and intraocular pressure-lowering agents, which improved her ocular symptoms. She subsequently received primary radiotherapy, which has successfully reduced the size of the tumour.
