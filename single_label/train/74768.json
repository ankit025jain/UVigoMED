{"id":74768,"title":"Premature mortality in poor health and low income adults with epilepsy.","abstract":"To examine mortality and causes of death (CODs) in socioeconomically disadvantaged persons with epilepsy (PWEs) in the United States.We performed a retrospective open cohort analysis using Ohio Medicaid claims data between 1992 and 2008 to assess mortality and COD in 68,785 adult Medicaid beneficiaries with epilepsy. Case fatality (CF), mortality rates (MRs), standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and years of potential life lost (YPLLs) were calculated. The SMRs were estimated to compare risk of death in PWEs with that in the general Medicaid population with and without disabilities. Proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs), YPLLs, and SMRs for specific COD were also obtained.There were 12,630 deaths in PWEs. CF was 18.4%, the age-race-sex adjusted MR was 18.6/1,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.3-18.9). The SMR was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.8-1.9) when compared to the general Medicaid population, and was 1.4 (95% CI, 1.3-1.6) when compared to those with disabilities. The average YPLL was 16.9 years (range 1-47 years). Both epilepsy and comorbid conditions significantly contributed to premature mortality in PWEs. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and unintentional injuries were the most common COD and account for a large proportion of YPLLs. Deaths from epilepsy-related causes occurred in about 10% of the cases.Socioeconomically deprived PWEs, especially young adults, experience high mortality and die 17 years prematurely. The high mortality in Medicaid beneficiaries with epilepsy affirms that comorbid conditions and epilepsy play a crucial role in premature death. Management of comorbid conditions is, at a minimum, as important as epilepsy management, and therefore deserves more attention from physicians, particularly those who care for Medicaid beneficiaries with epilepsy.","date":"2014-11-14","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25244361","annotations":[{"name":"United
