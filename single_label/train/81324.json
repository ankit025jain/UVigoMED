{"id":81324,"title":"[New concepts in aligner therapy with the orthocaps system].","abstract":"Orthodontic tooth movement with aligners poses challenges peculiar to removable appliances. The mechanical limitations of aligners can be overcome, to some extent, by increasing the aligner grip on teeth as well as by choosing elastic materials in their fabrication. Sound planning together with the use of auxiliaries can result in obtaining satisfactory results for the patients who seek an aesthetically pleasing and comfortable alternative to fixed appliance systems. The salient features of the Orthocaps System are the use of elastic thermoplastics, precision scanning, high pressure thermoforming, 3D interactive set-ups for treatment planning and approval, treatment evaluation at regular intervals during treatment and a unique attachment design (friction pads).
