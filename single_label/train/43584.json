{"id":43584,"title":"Successful closure of gastrocutaneous fistulas using the Surgisis(®) anal fistula plug.","abstract":"Gastrocutaneous fistulas remain an uncommon complication of upper gastrointestinal surgery. Less common but equally problematic are gastrocutaneous fistulas secondary to non-healing gastrostomies. Both are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Surgical repair remains the gold standard of care. For those unfit for surgical intervention, results from conservative management can be disappointing. We describe a case series of seven patients with gastrocutaneous fistulas who were unfit for surgical intervention. These patients were managed successfully in a minimally invasive manner using the Surgisis(®) (Cook Surgical, Bloomington, IN, US) anal fistula plug.Between September 2008 and January 2009, seven patients with gastrocutaneous fistulas presented to Wishaw General Hospital. Four gastrocutaneous fistulas represented non-healing gastrostomies, two followed an anastomotic leak after an oesophagectomy and one following an anastomotic leak after a distal gastrectomy. All patients had poor nutritional reserve with no other identifiable reason for failure to heal. All were deemed unfit for surgical intervention. Five gastrocutaneous fistulas were closed successfully using the Surgisis(®) anal fistula plug positioned directly into the fistula tract under local anaesthesia and two gastrocutaneous fistulas were closed successfully using the Surgisis(®) anal fistula positioned endoscopically using a rendezvous technique.For the five patients with gastrocutaneous fistulas closed directly under local anaesthesia, oral alimentation was reinstated immediately. Fistula output ceased on day 12 with complete epithelialisation occurring at a median of day 26. For the two gastrocutaneous fistulas closed endoscopically using the rendezvous technique, oral alimentation was reinstated on day 5 with immediate cessation of fistula output. Follow-up upper gastrointestinal endoscopy confirmed re-epithelialisation at eight weeks. In none of the cases has there been fistula recurrence (range of follow-up duration: 30-59 months).Surgisis(®) anal fistula plugs can be used safely and effectively to close gastrocutaneous fistulas in a minimally invasive manner in patients unfit for surgical intervention.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780017","annotations":[{"name":"General surgery","weight":0.853393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.810215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.760924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.738156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.636262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.61929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.57016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.479277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.47573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.461065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anal fistula","weight":0.385456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_fistula"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.355173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.345775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Digestive system surgery","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_system_surgery"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Indiana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
