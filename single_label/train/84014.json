{"id":84014,"title":"Oroxylin A inhibits ATRA-induced IL-6 expression involved in retinoic acid syndrome by down-regulating CHOP.","abstract":"Production of IL-6 constituted the major cause of death in the ATRA trial called retinoic acid syndrome (RAS). LAP and LIP are active and inactive isoforms of C/EBP?, respectively. Inactive LIP dimerized with LAP to eliminate its activity. Following treatment with ATRA, CHOP expression was increased and dimerized with LIP more preferentially than LAP to rescue function of LAP. Oroxylin A has been reported to activate CHOP, a key mediator of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, and resulted in apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that low concentration of oroxylin A (? 40 ?M) showed no apoptosis effect on NB4 and HL-60 cells and decreased the CHOP protein level via promoting its degradation. MG132 was utilized to conform the effect of oroxylin A on degrading CHOP. Our results showed that oroxylin A decreased the level of IL-6 secretion of NB4 cells with or without ATRA treatment while the effect was eliminated by C/EBP? siRNA. We conclude that oroxylin A possessed abilities of inhibiting the ATRA-induced IL-6 production via modulation of LAP/LIP/CHOP in leukemia cell lines, which could providing a therapeutic strategy for RAS.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25192658","annotations":[{"name":"Protein dimer","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_dimer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.800383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Retinoic acid","weight":0.769027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoic_acid"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.754552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.702847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.665761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.581676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.407748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.300315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.219995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Tretinoin","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tretinoin"},{"name":"Retinoic acid syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoic_acid_syndrome"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"HL60","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HL60"},{"name":"Unfolded protein response","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfolded_protein_response"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"MG Cars","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_Cars"},{"name":"Demonic possession","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_possession"},{"name":"Rescue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Nota bene","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nota_bene"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
