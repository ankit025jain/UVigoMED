{"id":36136,"title":"The use of the Tsuge procedure for pedal macrodactyly: relevance in pediatric orthopedics.","abstract":"Pedal macrodactyly is a rare clinical entity that poses a challenge to practicing pediatric orthopedic surgeons. Many treatment options have been proposed. In 1967, Kenya Tsuge proposed a method to decrease the length, width, and circumference of a macrodactylous digit, while maintaining the cosmetic benefit of keeping the nail. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with using this technique in four children (six toes) over a 4-year period. The surgery is described and our results reviewed. We believe that the Tsuge procedure is a technically feasible, effective, single-stage reconstructive technique for pedal macrodactyly that pediatric orthopedic surgeons should have in their armamentarium.
