{"id":82517,"title":"Case report of an oral fibroma occurring in a patient with familial multiple lipomas.","abstract":"A wide variety of lesions may manifest in the oral soft tissues that could be confusing and challenging for the clinicians. These lesions could be as simple as trauma-induced ulcers that need about 2 weeks to heal, to a more complicated situation such as oral cancer. The key points in developing diagnosis and a possible treatment plan may include a comprehensive oral examination, simple understanding of normal oral tissue features, and knowledge of common oral lesions. This will help in the development of a differential diagnosis of the oral lesions/masses based on the risk factors in that particular patient. In this case report, we present a simple oral mass in a patient who had an oral fibroma and lipomas in other areas.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600803","annotations":[{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.792902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.585223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.470534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lipoma","weight":0.237091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoma"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.15708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.156982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Fibroma","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroma"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Lichen planus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen_planus"},{"name":"Radiation treatment planning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_treatment_planning"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
