{"id":69630,"title":"[Expressions of netrin-1 and UNC5B in prostate cancer and their clinical significance].","abstract":"To search for a new diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer by comparing the differences in the expressions of netrin-1 and UNC5B in prostate cancer cells with different invasive abilities.We examined the expressions of netrin-1 and UNC5B in five prostate cancer cell lines DU145, 22RV1, PC3, PC3M and RWPE-1 using RT-PCR and Western blot, and positioned the ligands netrin-1 and its receptor UNC5B in the prostate cancer cells by immunofluorescence.Both netrin-1 and UNC5B were expressed in the prostate cancer cells, and the expression of netrin-1 was significantly increased in highly invasive cells (P < 0.05), while that of UNC5B in RWPE-1 (normal) cells (P < 0.05).The expressions of netrin-1 and UNC5B are closely related to the infiltration and progression of prostate cancer, and expected to be as potential biomarkers for predicting the malignancy degree of prostate cancer.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432616","annotations":[{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.442208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.2432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"London Buses route RV1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Buses_route_RV1"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"3M","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Duke University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"},{"name":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Expression (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Netrin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netrin"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Recreational vehicle","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
