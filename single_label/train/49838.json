{"id":49838,"title":"Subclinical Cushing syndrome: a review.","abstract":"Owing to its diagnostic challenges, subclinical Cushing syndrome (SCS) is likely to be highly underdiagnosed and undertreated, and the overall incidence may be as high as 5% to 20% in patients with adrenal incidentalomas. The diagnosis can be established by a systematic and thorough biochemical evaluation. SCS has been associated with significant morbidity, which at least partly may be reversed by surgery. Given the low rates of complications and the possibility to reverse the detrimental effects of elevated cortisol secretion, minimally invasive adrenalectomy is recommended for patients with biochemically proven or suspected SCS who are appropriate surgical candidates.
