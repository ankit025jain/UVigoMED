{"id":46190,"title":"IL-28B polymorphisms correlated with treatment response in HCV-4 mono-infected patients: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"The role of interleukin 28B (IL-28B) polymorphisms played in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been gradually explicit, especially in HCV genotype 1, 2 and 3. However, no confirmative conclusion was acquired in genotype 4 HCV patients. Thus we conducted this meta-analysis.We searched the commonly used databases both in English and Chinese. Meta-analysis was performed in fixed/random effects models using STATA 12.0 or R software. Publication bias was examined through Egger's test and Begg's funnel plot.In total, 11 studies were included in this meta-analysis, encompassing 1284 patients who were mono-infected with HCV-4 and received Peg-interferon (Peg-IFN) plus Ribavirin (Rbv). Around 53.0% patients would achieve sustained virologic response (SVR), 36.6% achieve rapid virologic response (RVR) and 62.4% achieve end of treatment response (ETR). Egyptian patients had a higher rate achieving SVR than non-Egyptian patients (56.3% vs. 47.8%). IL-28B rs12979860 CC genotype not only favored SVR (OR?=?3.95, 95%CI?=?3.03-5.16), regardless of citizenship, but also favored RVR (OR?=?3.82, 95%CI?=?2.46-5.95) and ETR (OR?=?4.22, 95%CI?=?2.81-6.34). IL-28B rs8099917 genotype TT also correlated with SVR (OR?=?3.41, 95%CI?=?1.92-6.07), but might not with RVR. IL-28B rs12980275 might still correlate with SVR, but warrant more studies to validate.The favorable IL-28B rs12979860 genotype is a statistically significant predictor of SVR, RVR and ETR in HCV-4 monoinfected patients treated with Peg-IFN plus Rbv. Rs8099917 might predict SVR but not RVR. Egyptian HCV-4 patients would achieve better outcomes than non-Egyptian patients when treated with standard care.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System
