{"id":27024,"title":"[Is there still an actual place for cardiovascular prevention in the elderly? Focus on antiplatelet and lipid lowering agents].","abstract":"The increase in life expectancy raises the difficult question of the most appropriate preventive medical therapy in the elderly. Indeed, beyond physiological age, comorbidities, contraindications and life expectancy should be considered before starting any treatment. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in our country, especially in the elderly. A preventive treatment aiming at controlling cardiovascular risk factors should be initiated based on the currently available evidence. We shall briefly discuss the value of cardiovascular prevention in the elderly and specifically focus on the use (or not) of antiplatelet agents and lipid-lowering drugs (i.e. statins).","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065239","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.832051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.801047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.383311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.141472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"}]}
