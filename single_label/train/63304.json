{"id":63304,"title":"Management of myelodysplastic syndromes in adults: guidelines from the Belgian Haematological Society.","abstract":"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of haematological disorders characterized by ineffective haematopoiesis and an increased risk for leukemic transformation. In recent years several new therapeutics have emerged that have demonstrated to alter the natural course of the disease. This document summarizes the state of the art in diagnosis and treatment of this heterogeneous disease, as proposed by a group of expert haematologists in the field of MDS from the Belgian Haematological Society. Its main purpose is to guide clinicians in daily practice to treat patients with this disease, within the limitations of current reimbursement modalities in Belgium.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455794","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.407222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.19899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Belgium","weight":0.0547007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"State of the art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art"},{"name":"Natural history of disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history_of_disease"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Reimbursement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reimbursement"},{"name":"Sovereign state","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state"}]}
