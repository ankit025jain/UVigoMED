{"id":81654,"title":"Role of fluoridated dentifrices in root caries formation in vitro.","abstract":"To evaluate in vitro root caries formation in human permanent teeth and to determine the effects of commercially available dentifrices containing different amounts of fluoride, while employing a well-tested artificial caries system using an acidified gel.Root surfaces from caries-free human permanent teeth (n = 10) underwent debridement and fluoride-free prophylaxis. The tooth roots were sectioned into six portions, and acid-resistant varnish was placed with two sound root surface windows exposed on each tooth portion. Each portion from a single tooth was assigned to a treatment group: (1) No treatment control; (2) Denticious 5000 dentifrice (5,000 ppm F + xylitol); (3) PreviDent 5000 (5,000 ppm F); (4) AIM dentifrice (1,500 ppm F); (5) Listerine dentifrice (1,300 ppm F); and (6) Crest Regular Paste (1,500 ppm F). Tooth portions were treated with fresh dentifrice twice daily for 180 seconds, followed by fresh synthetic saliva rinsing over a 7-day period. Controls were exposed twice daily to fresh synthetic saliva rinsing over a 7-day period. In vitro root caries were created using an acidified gel (pH 4.25, 21 days). Longitudinal sections (three sections/tooth portion, 30 sections/group; 60 lesions/group) were evaluated for mean lesion depths (water imbibition, polarized light). Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA and Duncan's Multiple Range test.Mean lesion depths were 389 +/- 43 microm for No treatment - control, 223 +/- 33 microm for Denticious 5000 dentifrice, 242 +/- 42 microm for Prevident 5000, 337 +/- 29 microm for AIM dentifrice, 297 +/- 37 microm for Listerine dentifrice, and 282 +/- 34 microm for Crest Regular Paste dentifrice. All treatment groups had mean depths significantly less than the No treatment - control group (P < 0.05). Denticious 5000 and PreviDent 5000 had significantly reduced mean depth compared with the other dentifrice treatment groups (P < 0.05).","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902401","annotations":[{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.863553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Xylitol","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.787787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.72334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.550458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"Listerine","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listerine"},{"name":"Varnish","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish"},{"name":"Water fluoridation","weight":0.355084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.324864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.303213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.231728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.177943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.111102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Dentifrice","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentifrice"},{"name":"Crest (toothpaste)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(toothpaste)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Horse teeth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_teeth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
