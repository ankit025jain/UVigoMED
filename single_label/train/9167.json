{"id":9167,"title":"Lack of group X secreted phospholipase A? increases survival following pandemic H1N1 influenza infection.","abstract":"The role of Group X secreted phospholipase A2 (GX-sPLA2) during influenza infection has not been previously investigated. We examined the role of GX-sPLA2 during H1N1 pandemic influenza infection in a GX-sPLA2 gene targeted mouse (GX(-/-)) model and found that survival after infection was significantly greater in GX(-/-) mice than in GX(+/+) mice. Downstream products of GX-sPLA2 activity, PGD2, PGE2, LTB4, cysteinyl leukotrienes and Lipoxin A4 were significantly lower in GX(-/-) mice BAL fluid. Lung microarray analysis identified an earlier and more robust induction of T and B cell associated genes in GX(-/-) mice. Based on the central role of sPLA2 enzymes as key initiators of inflammatory processes, we propose that activation of GX-sPLA2 during H1N1pdm infection is an early step of pulmonary inflammation and its inhibition increases adaptive immunity and improves survival. Our findings suggest that GX-sPLA2 may be a potential therapeutic target during influenza.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725934","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Phospholipase A2","weight":0.788896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_A2"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.782119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Leukotriene","weight":0.739911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H1N1","weight":0.425546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1"},{"name":"Prostaglandin E2","weight":0.411106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_E2"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.403847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Prostaglandin D2","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin_D2"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.365899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pandemic","weight":0.3615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.26504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.211611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Leukotriene B4","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukotriene_B4"},{"name":"Lipoxin","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoxin"},{"name":"Influenza pandemic","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_pandemic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"}]}
