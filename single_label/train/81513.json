{"id":81513,"title":"The role of fluoride in erosion therapy.","abstract":"The role of fluoride in erosion therapy has long been questioned. However, recent research has yielded positive results. In this chapter, an overview of the literature is provided regarding the application of fluorides in the prevention and treatment of erosion and erosive wear. The results are presented and discussed for different fluoride sources such as monovalent and polyvalent fluorides, and for different vehicles such as toothpastes, solutions and rinses, as well as varnishes and gels. It is concluded that fluoride applications are very likely to be of use in the preventive treatment of erosive wear. Most promising are high-concentration, acidic formulations and the polyvalent fluoride sources, with the best evidence available for stannous fluoride. However, the evidence base for clinical effectiveness is still small.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24993271","annotations":[{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.507917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.427513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.290873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.246549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.212657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.153709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.0672669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Varnish","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnish"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.0453442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Tin(II) fluoride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_fluoride"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Sura","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sura"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Tin(II) chloride","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_chloride"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Polyvalence","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvalence"}]}
