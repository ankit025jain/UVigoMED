{"id":76518,"title":"[AA Amyloidosis].","abstract":"AA amyloidosis is caused by the tissue deposition of AA protein, which is degraded from serum amyloid A (SAA) mainly produced in an inflammatory state. However, AA amyloidosis is hardly observed in neurol-cerebral diseases. Therefore, in this issue, the role of cytokines and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in SAA-inducing mechanism are presented.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998825","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.650688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Amyloid","weight":0.643381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Amyloidosis","weight":0.394721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.216904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Serum amyloid A","weight":0.0419679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_amyloid_A"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Transducer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer"},{"name":"AA amyloidosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_amyloidosis"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"}]}
