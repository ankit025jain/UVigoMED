{"id":81381,"title":"Long-term stability of anterior open bite correction in mixed dentition with a new treatment protocol.","abstract":"The treatment of choice for skeletal open bite is orthognathic surgery combined with pre and post- surgicalorthodontics; however relapse can be observed and alternative solutions are sought to avoid surgery whenever possible. A case is reported showing an original treatment protocol in order to obtain aesthetic, functional and stable results.A 10.2 year old boy with anterior open bite was treated with a Hyrax type rapid maxillary expander on the maxilla (one month) and a lingual arch in the lower jaw; then, grinding of deciduous molars was performed, a lingual grid was positioned and a myofunctional treatment (exercises) was started. The subsequent treatment phase was achieved with a lip bumper and fixed straight wire appliances on both arches. After 24 months of active treatment, retainers were used to maintain the good results achieved, which were unchanged at the long term controls, 3 and 7 years after treatment.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102467","annotations":[{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.587809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.48582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.437115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Deciduous","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.338221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.328197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.246946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Orthognathic surgery","weight":0.127246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthognathic_surgery"},{"name":"Hyrax","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrax"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Open bite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_bite"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Bumper (automobile)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_(automobile)"},{"name":"Retainer (orthodontics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retainer_(orthodontics)"},{"name":"Dental braces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Heterosexuality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality"},{"name":"Horse teeth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_teeth"},{"name":"Pharyngeal arch","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_arch"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 10","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_10"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
