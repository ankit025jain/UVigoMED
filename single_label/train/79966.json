{"id":79966,"title":"Description of a new Dermacentor (Acari: Ixodidae) species, a parasite of wild mammals in Central America.","abstract":"A new tick species belonging to the genus Dermacentor Koch, 1844, Dermacentor panamensis n. sp., is described. All stages of this species are similar to those of Dermacentor halli McIntosh, 1931, with which it was confused for a long time. Males of D. panamensis can be distinguished from those of D. halli by the following suite of characters: narrower conscutum, broader basis capituli, shorter dorsal cornua, narrower palpi, palpal segment III tapering to its apex, legs poorly ornate: ivory colored patches present only on dorsal aspects of leg segments (mostly on legs III and IV), and internal spur of coxae I narrower and more tapering. Females of D. panamensis can be distinguished from those of D. halli by the following suite of characters: narrower and less ornate scutum, broader basis capituli, shorter dorsal cornua, larger porose areas, narrower palpi, palpal segment III tapering to its apex, legs poorly ornate: ivory colored patches present only on dorsal aspects of leg segments (mostly on legs III and IV), and internal spur of coxae I narrower and more tapering. Nymphs of D. panamensis can be distinguished from those of D. halli by clear posterolateral projections of scutum and by absence of coxal \"pore\" on coxae I-IV, while larvae of D. panamensis can be distinguished from those ofD. halli by shorter and less sharp lateral projections of basis capituli dorsally and slightly sharp anterior angle of basis capituli. D. panamensis is known from highlands of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama where the adults were collected from porcupines and unidentified sloth and mouse while nymphs and larvae were found on various rodents and a bat.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843922","annotations":[{"name":"Nicaragua","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua"},{"name":"Costa Rica","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"},{"name":"Guatemala","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.831328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Honduras","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Panama","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama"},{"name":"Bat","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.75702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Sloth","weight":0.715128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.682741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.651102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.6415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Pedipalp","weight":0.547075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedipalp"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.511032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Arthropod leg","weight":0.411168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod_leg"},{"name":"Acari","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acari"},{"name":"Nymph (biology)","weight":0.316209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymph_(biology)"},{"name":"Scute","weight":0.278446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scute"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.278106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.185914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Porcupine","weight":0.133333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine"},{"name":"Ivory","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.101356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Nymph","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymph"},{"name":"Sweat gland","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland"},{"name":"Dermacentor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermacentor"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Leg","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"1931","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1931"},{"name":"Highland (geography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_(geography)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Glossary of entomology terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_entomology_terms"}]}
