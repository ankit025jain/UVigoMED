{"id":82535,"title":"Denture adhesives improve mastication in denture wearers.","abstract":"This clinical trial evaluated the influence of denture adhesive (DA) use on masticatory function in denture wearers according to their denture-bearing ridge status.Thirty edentulous subjects, wearing new well-fitting dentures, were classified as having either a normal or resorbed ridge. Mastication was evaluated in patients who completed chewing tests with and without two DA substances (cream or strips), which were randomly assigned. A chewing test with a sieve method analyzed masticatory performance. A kinesiographic device evaluated chewing cycle, and a visual analog scale measured masticatory ability. Data were submitted to Mauchly's sphericity test, and PROC MIXED procedures were conducted on repeated measures. Tukey-Kramer tests performed appropriate statistical comparisons (P ? .05).DA use increased masticatory performance and ability in patients with both ridge types (P < .05). Subjects with resorbed ridges showed the best masticatory performance (P < .001) and lowest chewing cycle time (P < .001) with DA cream, followed by DA strips and the nonadhesive trial. For normal ridge subjects, decreases in Ã—50 values were only significant with DA use (P < .05), regardless of DA type. The denture-bearing ridge status alone did not alter masticatory function in any of the parameters evaluated.DAs improve mastication by shortening the chewing cycle and by enhancing chewing ability and performance.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596911","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"People's Republic of China","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Analog signal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"District attorney","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Ridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Sieve","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fingerprint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
