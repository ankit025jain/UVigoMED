{"id":43822,"title":"CD55 limits sensitivity to complement-dependent cytolysis triggered by heterologous expression of ?-gal xenoantigen in colon tumor cells.","abstract":"Engineering cancer cells to express heterologous antigen ?-gal and induce the destruction of tumor cells depending on the complement cascade may be a promising strategy of tumor therapy. However, the feasibility and effect of using ?-gal to induce colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line cytolysis is not yet known. In this study, we evaluated ?-gal expression's ability to sensitize human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines to complement attack in cell lines LoVo, SW620, and Ls-174T. Nearly all ?-gal-expressing LoVo and SW620 cells were killed by normal human serum (NHS), but ?-gal-expressing Ls-174T cells showed no significant lysis. We analyzed the expression levels of membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) on the three cell lines, and their protective role in ?-gal-mediated activation of the complement. LoVo showed no expression of any of the three proteins. CD59 was strongly expressed by SW620 and Ls-174T. CD46 and CD55 varied between the two cell lines. CD46 on SW620 was only half the intensity of CD46 on Ls-174T. Ls-174T showed a notable expression of CD55, while expression of CD55 on SW620 was not detected. The sensitivity of Ls-174T expressing ?-gal to NHS greatly increased following the downregulation of CD46 and CD55 with short hairpin RNA (shRNA). However, there is no increase in cell killing when CD59 expression was diminished. Our findings suggest that the use of ?-gal as antigen to induce tumor cell killing may be a potential therapeutic strategy in colon cancer and that CD55 plays a primary role in conferring resistance to lysis.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763553","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.834958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.802427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.748852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.710645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.631157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.595466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.542155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"CD46","weight":0.459824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD46"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.298795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Stem-loop","weight":0.291177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Cytolysis","weight":0.264178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytolysis"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Small hairpin RNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hairpin_RNA"},{"name":"Decay-accelerating factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay-accelerating_factor"},{"name":"CD59","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD59"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Heterologous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"},{"name":"DNA-binding protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA-binding_protein"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"}]}
