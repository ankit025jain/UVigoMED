{"id":22959,"title":"Prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in ocular infections.","abstract":"To study the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among S. aureus ocular infections in a tertiary health center in Brazil and compare antibiotic susceptibility patterns between MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates.Electronic records from the ocular microbiology laboratory of the Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Paulo were retrospectively reviewed. During a 10-year period (between January 2000 and December 2009) all conjunctivitis, keratitis, and endophthalmitis cases with a positive culture for S. aureus were identified. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method.Five hundred sixty-six S. aureus isolates were identified; of those, 56 (9.9%) were resistant to methicillin. Throughout the 10-year period, Staphylococcus aureus showed a significant increasing trend from 7.55% to 16.18% among overall S. aurues infections (p=0.001) and from 3.7% to 13.16% in conjunctivitis (p=0.001). Conversely, we did not observe the same trend among those with keratitis (p=0.38). Staphylococcus aureus isolates showed higher resistance rates to tobramycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin when compared with S. aureus isolates (p< 0.001). All cases were susceptible to vancomycin.We observed an increasing trend in the overall prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus ocular infections and statistically significant higher resistance rates to commonly used antibiotics compared to Staphylococcus aureus. Our data supports the need for constant bacterial surveillance and should be taken into consideration before initiating empiric treatment of ocular infections.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510081","annotations":[{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Conjunctivitis","weight":0.882119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Ciprofloxacin","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Endophthalmitis","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endophthalmitis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Moxifloxacin","weight":0.785241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxifloxacin"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Meticillin","weight":0.682734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meticillin"},{"name":"Tobramycin","weight":0.677318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobramycin"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Empiric therapy","weight":0.632061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiric_therapy"},{"name":"Keratitis","weight":0.546442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.377511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.334918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gatifloxacin","weight":0.217283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatifloxacin"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.154987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0724552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Community health center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_center"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
