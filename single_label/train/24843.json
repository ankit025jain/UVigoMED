{"id":24843,"title":"Relation between coronary arterial dominance and left ventricular ejection fraction after ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction in patients having percutaneous coronary intervention.","abstract":"The presence of a left dominant coronary artery system is associated with worse outcome after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) compared with right dominance or a balanced coronary artery system. However, the association between coronary arterial dominance and left ventricular (LV) function at follow-up after STEMI is unclear. The present study aimed at evaluating the relation between coronary arterial dominance and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) shortly after STEMI and at 12-month follow-up. A total of 741 patients with STEMI (mean age 60 ± 11 years and 77% men) were evaluated with 2-dimentional echocardiography within 48 hours of admission (baseline) and at 12-month follow-up after STEMI. Coronary arterial dominance was assessed on the angiographic images obtained during primary percutaneous coronary intervention. A right, left, and balanced dominant coronary artery system was noted in 640 (86%), 58 (8%), and 43 (6%) patients, respectively. At baseline, significant difference in LV function was observed, with slightly lower LVEF in patients with a left dominant coronary artery system (LVEF 45 ± 8% vs 48 ± 9% and 50 ± 9%, for left dominant, right dominant, and balanced coronary artery system respectively, p = 0.03). However, at 12-month follow-up no differences in LV function or volumes were observed among the different coronary arterial dominance groups. In conclusion, patients with a left dominant coronary artery system had lower LVEF early after STEMI. At 12-month follow-up, differences in LVEF were no longer present among the different coronary arterial dominance groups.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282315","annotations":[{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.808713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"741","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/741"},{"name":"640","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/640"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
