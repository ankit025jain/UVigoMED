{"id":82405,"title":"Clinical treatment outcomes for 40 patients with bisphosphonates-related osteonecrosis of the jaws.","abstract":"Bisphosphonates (BPs) are used to treat osteoporosis and bone metastases from malignancy. They may result in BPs-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) in a subset of patients receiving BPs. This study examined whether conservative or aggressive surgical approach could result in successful treatment of BRONJ lesions and assessed whether concomitant steroid administration or tobacco smoking habit might hinder the remission of BRONJ lesions.The 40 BRONJ patients were evenly divided into four different groups. Group 1 contained 10 patients with concomitant corticosteroid medication but without smoking habit. Group 2 contained 10 patients with smoking habit but without concomitant corticosteroid medication. Groups 3 and 4 each consisted of 10 patients without concomitant corticosteroid medication and smoking habit. To avoid bias, each group contained equal number of patients with different stages of BRONJ. Patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3 received conservative treatment, including antibiotic coverage, antibacterial solution irrigation, and minor surgical debridement. Patients in Group 4 were treated with aggressive surgical excision of necrotic bone segment.The mean duration to achieve complete remission of BRONJ lesion was 19.7±0.6, 18.2±0.5, 13.0±1.0, and 7.6±1.1 months for patients in Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Student's t-test showed significant differences in the mean duration to achieve complete remission of BRONJ lesion between Groups 1 and 3, between Groups 2 and 3, between Groups 3 and 4, between Groups 1 and 4, and between Groups 2 and 4 (all p values < 0.001).Although both conservative and aggressive surgical approaches can result in successful treatment of BRONJ lesions, aggressive surgical treatment needs a shorter mean duration to achieve complete remission of BRONJ lesion than conservative treatment. Concomitant corticosteroid administration or tobacco smoking may prolong the duration for complete remission of BRONJ lesion.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630034","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.901267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.821322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.782792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.762615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Debridement","weight":0.709712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debridement"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.614539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.592681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.522274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Bone tumor","weight":0.452312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.395769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.224057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Osteonecrosis of the jaw","weight":0.066561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteonecrosis_of_the_jaw"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate-associated_osteonecrosis_of_the_jaw"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
