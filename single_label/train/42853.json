{"id":42853,"title":"[Radiotherapy for elderly patient with rectal cancer: which benefit?].","abstract":"Age acts as a major risk factor of cancer. In the near future, with the aging of the population, we will treat more and more elderly patients with oncologic disease. Unfortunately, these patients are often excluded from randomized trials. How can we, therefore, define guidelines for this particular population of patients? Moreover, older patients often present multiple morbidities synchronously with the oncologic disease. This constellation of diseases makes the therapeutic strategy even more difficult. The highest incidence of rectal cancer is observed at 80 years old or above. This is significantly older than the mean age of the population included in clinical trials. Although, the prognosis of young patients with rectal cancer has improved over the past few decades, this is not the case for patients over 75 years old. A geriatric evaluation, as a part of a multidisciplinary approach, may allow to better select patient able to benefit from a combined treatment. Radiotherapy plays a crucial role in the treatment of rectal cancer. There are no solid data currently available on the real impact of radiotherapy on survival in an elderly population with rectal cancer. Do these patients really benefit from this treatment and what is the impact of radiotherapy on their quality of life? This review will try to give some answers to these important questions.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24822305","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
