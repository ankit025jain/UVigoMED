{"id":34362,"title":"Umbilical endometriosis associated with large umbilical hernia. Case report.","abstract":"Umbilical endometriosis is a rare condition, usually following laparoscopic and surgical procedures involving the umbilicus.Spontaneous umbilical endometriosis occurring without any previous abdominal or uterine surgery is extremely rare. The maximal depth of penetration of the umbilical endometriosis described is up to fascial level. There have been only two cases of endometriosis reported arising within umbilical hernia. The authors report a case of a patient with spontaneous umbilical endometriosis associated with a large umbilical hernia, treated by surgical excision and mesh repair of the abdominal wall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first described case of the association of umbilical endometriosis with a large umbilical hernia that requires prosthetic mesh repair of the abdominal wall defect.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742424","annotations":[{"name":"Navel","weight":0.800094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Abdominal wall","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.738136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.646728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Umbilical hernia","weight":0.628027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_hernia"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.602344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.540286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.536003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Abdominal wall defect","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_wall_defect"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Skin effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect"},{"name":"Mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Greatest hits album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_hits_album"},{"name":"Alpha taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_taxonomy"}]}
