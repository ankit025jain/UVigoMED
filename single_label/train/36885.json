{"id":36885,"title":"One-carbon metabolite levels in mid-pregnancy and risks of conotruncal heart defects.","abstract":"Evidence exists for an association between use of vitamin supplements with folic acid in early pregnancy and reduced risk for offspring with conotruncal heart defects. A few observations have been made about nutrients related to one-carbon metabolism other than folate. Our prospective study attempted to extend information on nutrition and conotruncal heart defects by measuring analytes in mid-pregnancy sera.This study included data from a repository of women's mid-pregnancy serum specimens based on screened pregnancies in California from 2002-2007. Each woman's specimen was linked with delivery information to determine whether her fetus had a conotruncal heart defect or another structural malformation, or was nonmalformed. We identified 140 conotruncal cases and randomly selected 280 specimens as nonmalformed controls. Specimens were tested for a variety of analytes, including homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, folate, vitamin B12 , pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, pyridoxic acid, riboflavin, total choline, betaine, methionine, cysteine, cystathionine, arginine, asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine.We did not observe statistical evidence for substantial differences between cases and controls for any of the measured analytes. Analyses specifically targeting B-vitamins also did not reveal differences between cases and controls.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532477","annotations":[{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Choline","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Methionine","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.750087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Vitamin B12","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Betaine","weight":0.714885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betaine"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.675732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pyridoxal phosphate","weight":0.577318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyridoxal_phosphate"},{"name":"Pyridoxal","weight":0.37814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyridoxal"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.36041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Methylmalonic acid","weight":0.335303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmalonic_acid"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Multivitamin","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivitamin"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"California","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Cystathionine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystathionine"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"}]}
