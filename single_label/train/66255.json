{"id":66255,"title":"[Metastatic pulmonary calcification in a patient with a functioning kidney allograft. Report of one case].","abstract":"In renal transplants patients, metastatic pulmonary calcifications have been reported occasionally when the grafts are dysfunctional and rarely when they are functioning normally. We report a male who received a renal allograft in 1994 at the age of 61 years. Nineteen years later a routine chest X ray showed diffuse infiltrates and a CT scan showed diffuse calcifications in both lungs. These were interpreted as metastatic pulmonary calcifications. The last available laboratory determinations were a serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl and urinary protein excretion of 255 mg/24 hours. No further studies were done since the patient experienced a sudden death due to an acute myocardial infarction.
