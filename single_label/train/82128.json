{"id":82128,"title":"Fluoride concentration in commonly consumed infant juices.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to measure the fluoride concentration in the most commonly consumed, commercially available infant fruit juices and to determine if a significant difference existed among various juice flavors and brands.Ninety samples of different flavors from three infant juice manufacturing companies were analyzed using the Taves microdiffusion method. The fluoride content in one serving juice container was calculated and compared to the recommended optimal daily fluoride intake.Fluoride concentrations ranged from 0.11 to 1.81 ppm (mean=0.75+0.45 ppm) for all samples. A statistically significant difference in fluoride concentration among different manufacturers (P<.001) was found. Gerber juices contained higher fluoride amounts (mean=1.1+0.22 ppm) than Beechnut juices (mean=0.43+0.42 ppm) and Earth's Best juices (mean=0.34+0.13 ppm).Fluoride was found in all tested infant juice samples, and concentrations varied among manufacturers and flavors assessed. Fluoride in all tested samples was below the recommended optimal daily intake. When taking other fluoride sources into consideration, infants six months old and younger who consume three times the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommended amounts of juice per day may be at risk of developing fluorosis.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709429","annotations":[{"name":"United States","weight":0.310572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.246439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Brand","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"American Academy of Pediatrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics"},{"name":"Dental fluorosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis"},{"name":"Flavor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"},{"name":"Packaging and labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Juice","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.0163128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
