{"id":68829,"title":"Effects on serum uric acid by difference of the renal protective effects with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in chronic kidney disease patients.","abstract":"Hyperuricemia and hyperlipidemia have attracted attention as progression factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the drug treatment of hyperuricemia and hyperlipidemia complications, Atorvastatin (ATV), which inhibits urinary protein, increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and has renal protective effects, and Rosuvastatin (ROS) were found be suitable because they promote serum uric acid (SUA) excretion. However, these drugs were administered at very high doses in previous studies. In this study, we have investigated the effects of ATV or ROS on renal protective effects and their SUA levels before and three months after each drug administration in CKD patients. We retrospectively investigated outpatients presenting with CKD (stages 3) on the basis of their electronic medical records as subjects. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was significantly increased after ATV administration, whereas no change in eGFR was observed following ROS administration. Furthermore, SUA levels significantly decreased after ATV administration, whereas no changes were observed following ROS administration. Therefore, it may be not necessary to administer drugs that lower the SUA levels to patients presenting with hyperuricemia and hyperlipidemia complications associated with moderate renal failure, such as patients with at least stage 3 CKD. We consider that, by selecting ATV, the renal protective effects and SUA-lowering effect would be sufficient.
