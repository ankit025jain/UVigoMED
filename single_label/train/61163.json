{"id":61163,"title":"Identification of B-cell lymphoma subsets by plasma protein profiling using recombinant antibody microarrays.","abstract":"B-cell lymphoma (BCL) heterogeneity represents a key issue, often making the classification and clinical management of these patients challenging. In this pilot study, we outlined the first resolved view of BCL disease heterogeneity on the protein level by deciphering disease-associated plasma biomarkers, specific for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, using recombinant antibody microarrays targeting mainly immunoregulatory proteins. The results showed the BCLs to be heterogeneous, and revealed potential novel subgroups of each BCL. In the case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we also indicated a link between the novel subgroups and survival.
