{"id":90424,"title":"[Surgical approach of internal fixation of maxillofacial fracture].","abstract":"By summary and analysis of rigid internal fixation for the treatment of maxillofacial fractures incision and exposure, investigate the plate reasonable surgical approach of fracture reduction and fixation titanium.Summary of the 76 surgical cases, Counting the statistics of the number that the surgery ways choose by facial incision and fractures location, analysis of the indications for surgery and the advantages and disadvantages of various surgical approaches. Followed up for more than six months, in order to observe the recovery of occlusal function and the facial cosmetic results.The upper jaw or cheek bone has the more possibility in facial fracture, which used of a small incision hidden under the lip gingival sulcus and lower eyelid. After six months, the facial wound healing recover in good occlusal with no obvious scarring.Reasonable choice of surgical incision can make the fracture site exposure and the facial aesthetic effect into account.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616984","annotations":[{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.727931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.536216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.516757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.493287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.39426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.25196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.223116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0636352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0523561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Zygomatic bone","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomatic_bone"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Sulcus (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulcus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Reduction (orthopedic surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(orthopedic_surgery)"},{"name":"Hymenotomy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenotomy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0116392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"}]}
