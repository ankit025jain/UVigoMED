{"id":31052,"title":"Effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine on redox status and markers of renal function in mice inoculated with Bothrops jararaca and Crotalus durissus terrificus venoms.","abstract":"Renal dysfunction is an important aggravating factor in accidents caused by Crotalus durissus terrificus (Cdt) and Bothrops jararaca (Bj) bites. N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) is well known as a nephroprotective antioxidant with low toxicity. The present study investigated the effects of NAC on redox status and markers of renal function in mice that received vehicle (controls) or venoms (v) of Cdt and Bj. In controls NAC promoted hypercreatinemia, hypouremia, hyperosmolality with decreased urea in urine, hyperproteinuria, decreased protein and increased dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) in membrane-bound fraction (MF) from renal cortex (RC) and medulla (RM). NAC ameliorated or normalized altered creatinuria, proteinemia and aminopeptidase (AP) acid in MF, AP basic (APB) in soluble fraction (SF), and neutral AP in SF and MF from RC and RM in vBj envenomation. NAC ameliorated or normalized altered neutral AP in SF from RC and RM, and DPPIV and protein in MF from RC in vCdt envenomation. NAC ameliorated or restored renal redox status respectively in vCdt and vBj, and normalized uricemia in both envenomations. These data are promising perspectives that recommend the clinical evaluation of NAC as potential coadjuvant in the anti venom serotherapy for accidents with these snake's genera.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412461","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.920564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Venom","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.631481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.615367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Snake","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.595153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.502288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Crotalus durissus","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_durissus"},{"name":"Renal physiology","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology"},{"name":"Bothrops jararaca","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothrops_jararaca"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.28629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Envenomation","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envenomation"},{"name":"Antivenom","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivenom"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Bothrops","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothrops"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Renal cortex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cortex"},{"name":"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.0230596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Crotalus","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Andhra Pradesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Catholic Church","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Aminopeptidase","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminopeptidase"}]}
