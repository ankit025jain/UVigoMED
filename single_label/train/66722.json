{"id":66722,"title":"Attitudes of fertile and infertile woman towards new reproductive technologies: a case study of Lithuania.","abstract":"This article analyzes several key issues in the debate: the acceptability of in vitro fertilization; regulation of assisted reproduction and the possibilities of reimbursement for assisted reproduction treatment in Lithuania.Two groups of respondents participated in the survey: fertile women and women with fertility disorders. 93 completed questionnaires from women with fertility problems and 146 from women with no fertility problems were analysed.Fertile respondents more frequently perceived the embryo as a human being (Fertile Individuals - 68.5%; Infertile Individuals - 35.5%; p < 0.05) and more frequently maintained that assisted reproduction treatment should be only partly reimbursed (Fertile Individuals - 71.3%; Infertile Individuals - 39.8%; p < 0.05). Respondents with fertility disorders more frequently thought that artificial insemination procedure could also be applied to unmarried couples (Fertile Individuals - 51.4%; Infertile Individuals - 76.3%; p < 0.05), and more frequently agreed that there should be no age limit for artificial insemination procedures (Fertile Individuals - 36.3%; Infertile Individuals - 67.7%; p < 0.05). The majority of respondents in both groups (Fertile Individuals - 77.4%; Infertile Individuals - 82.8%; p < 0.05) believed that donation of reproductive cells should be regulated by law. Fertile respondents more frequently considered that strict legal regulation was necessary in case of the number of transferred embryos (Fertile Individuals - 69.2%; Infertile Individuals - 39.8%; p < 0.05) and freezing of embryos (Fertile Individuals - 69.9%; Infertile Individuals - 57.0%; p < 0.05).Fertile respondents were statistically more likely to believe that the IVF procedure should be applied only to married couples or women who had a regular partner, the age limit should be defined and the psychological assessment of the couple's relationship and their readiness for the IVF procedure was necessary. In contrast, infertile couples were statistically more likely than fertile respondents to maintain that the IVF procedure should be fully reimbursed by the state. Fertile respondents were statistically more likely to be categorical with respect to the number of embryos and the freezing of embryos. Meanwhile there is a statistically significant difference in opinions of infertile respondents who were in favour of stricter regulation on donation of reproductive cells.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684746","annotations":[{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.927138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Artificial insemination","weight":0.851124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.727131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.704731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.671318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Reproductive technology","weight":0.663745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.616811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.60681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.559993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Gamete","weight":0.535138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.495097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.468345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lithuania","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.370553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.295432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Insemination","weight":0.278001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insemination"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cohabitation","weight":0.22583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Domestic partnership","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Freezing","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"State (polity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Donation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
