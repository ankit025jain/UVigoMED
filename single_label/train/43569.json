{"id":43569,"title":"Two case reports of perineal hernia after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection with a proposed modification to the operative technique.","abstract":"Perineal hernia is a rare complication following laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection (APR) for rectal cancer. We present two case reports of perineal hernia following laparoscopic APR and discuss their management. We suggest that they developed because the pelvic peritoneum was left open during laparoscopic APR and propose that closure of the pelvic peritoneum should be routine in this operation.
