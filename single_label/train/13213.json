{"id":13213,"title":"Novel phage display-derived H5N1-specific scFvs with potential use in rapid avian flu diagnosis.","abstract":"The highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype infect poultry and have also been spreading to humans. Although new antiviral drugs and vaccinations can be effective, rapid detection would be more efficient to control the outbreak of infections. In this study, a phage-display library was applied to select antibody fragments for HPAI strain A/Hubei/1/2010. As a result, three clones were selected and sequenced. A hemagglutinin inhibition assay of the three scFvs revealed that none exhibited hemagglutination inhibition activity towards the H5N1 virus, yet they showed a higher binding affinity for several HPAI H5N1 strains compared with other influenza viruses. An ELISA confirmed that the HA protein was the target of the scFvs, and the results of a protein structure simulation showed that all the selected scFvs bound to the HA2 subunit of the HA protein. In conclusion, the three selected scFVs could be useful for developing a specific detection tool for the surveillance of HPAI epidemic strains.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487936","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Avian influenza","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H5N1","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.807772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Hemagglutination","weight":0.654509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutination"},{"name":"Bacteriophage","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.579949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.512683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Protein structure","weight":0.505686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.423569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.406682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.222201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.172072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0623612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"HA postcode area","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HA_postcode_area"}]}
