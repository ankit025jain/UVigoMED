{"id":47977,"title":"Overexpression of CMET is associated with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation and diminished prognosis in oesophageal adenocarcinoma but not in squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Inhibition of cMet is a promising therapeutic approach in human cancer, but few data in oesophageal cancer exist.Expression of mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (cMet), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) were investigated immunohistochemically in 246 oesophageal carcinomas (128 adenocarcinomas (AC); 118 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC)) and corresponding metastases in a subset of AC (n=42). Data on phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) and HER2 expression and on lymphovascular invasion (LVI) of tumour cells were available from previous studies.Overexpression of cMet was seen in 44 (34.4%) of AC, and nine (7.6%) of SCC (p<0.001, Chi square test). In AC but not in SCC, cMet expression correlated with EGFR expression (p<0.001, Chi square test), pSTAT3 expression (p=0.01, Chi square tests) and LVI of tumour cells (p<0.001, Chi square test). Overexpression of cMet was associated with shorter disease free, disease specific and overall survival of AC patients (p<0.05, Cox regression, respectively). All cMet positive ACs in which metastases were investigated had also cMet positive lymph node and distant metastases, but 25% of cMet negative primary tumours showed cMet positive lymph node and 33% distant metastases.CMet plays no relevant role in most oesophageal SCC. In contrast, cMet overexpression seems to be a key oncogene in about 35% of oesophageal AC, representing a highly promising therapeutic target and prognostic factor.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565853","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.86437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.816592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.779665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.74294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.64572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.630312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.512055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.332256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.233016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0460457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
