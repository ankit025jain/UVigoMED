{"id":60278,"title":"Coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome in a 51-year-old man with immune thrombocytopenic purpura: a case report.","abstract":"Treatment of the rare cases of patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura with acute coronary syndrome can be a significant problem. The patient in our case report was treated successfully with percutaneous coronary intervention.A 51-year-old man of Turkish origin who had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was admitted to our hospital with severe chest pain. His electrocardiography was normal on admission but dynamic ischemic changes were observed during follow-up. He underwent immediate coronary angiography. In his angiography, left anterior descending artery stenosis was 90% together with the diagonal ostium. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed successfully. Bleeding complications were not observed after the procedure.We report the presence of a rare case of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in a patient withÂ acute coronary syndrome. In this situation a serious multidisciplinary approach is required before coronary intervention.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24950596","annotations":[{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Acute coronary syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_coronary_syndrome"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.77158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.728732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.709617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.6387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.638131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.510158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_interventricular_branch_of_left_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.325472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.304215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.212434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
