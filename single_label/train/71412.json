{"id":71412,"title":"Effects of naproxen on cell proliferation and genotoxicity in MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, on the MG-63 human osteosarcoma cell line. MG-63 cells were exposed to naproxen in a wide range of concentrations of 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.42, 0.83, and 1.67 mg/ml for 72 h. The activity of naproxen was assessed by the following assays: cell morphology; 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay; comet assay; and acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining. Naproxen exerted a significant inhibitory effect on MG-63 cell proliferation, in a concentration-dependent manner, in all treatment groups compared with untreated cells. An increase in frequency of DNA damage, apoptotic bodies, apoptotic cells, and autophagic vacuoles was observed in MG-63-treated cells. Although future studies are needed, these findings suggest that naproxen may lead to improvements in treatment of patients with osteosarcoma.
