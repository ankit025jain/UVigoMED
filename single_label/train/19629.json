{"id":19629,"title":"New diagnostic possibilities in systemic neonatal infections: metabolomics.","abstract":"Systemic neonatal infection is a serious complication in preterm and term infants and is defined as a complex clinical syndrome caused by bacteria, fungi and virus. Sepsis remains among the leading causes of death in both developed and underdeveloped countries above all in the neonatal period. Earlier diagnosis may offer the ability to initiate treatment to prevent adverse outcomes. There have been many studies on various diagnostic haematological markers like acute phase reactants, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukins and presepsin. However, there is still no single test that satisfies the criteria as being the ideal marker for the early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. In this regard, metabolomic analysis seems to be a promising method for determining metabolic variations correlated with systemic neonatal infections.
