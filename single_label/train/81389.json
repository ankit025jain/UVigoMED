{"id":81389,"title":"Ligneous periodontal lesions in a young child with severe plasminogen deficiency: a case report.","abstract":"Ligneous periodontitis or gingivitis is a rare periodontal disorder, secondary to plasminogen deficiency, characterised by nodular gingival enlargements and progressive destructive membranous periodontal disease.We describe the early and successful dental management of a case of ligneous gingivitis secondary to plasminogen deficiency in a 6-year- old girl. The patient was referred because of a nodular asymptomatic gingival hypertrophy with ulceration around the eruption site of tooth 36, without any detectable tooth mobility. After non-surgical management of the lesion and strict follow-up, the first molar erupted completely, with no signs of bone and periodontal disease.Ulcerated periodontal lesions could represent the ?rst signs of plasminogen deficiency. The early treatment is essential in preventing infections and the onset of a destructive periodontitis. The paediatric dentist may play a key role in early diagnosis and treatment.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25101505","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.737677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.60707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.553583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.426078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.30333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tooth eruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_eruption"}]}
