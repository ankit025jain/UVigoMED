{"id":61745,"title":"Inactivation of protein-phosphatase 2A causing hyperphosphorylation of autoantigenic paraprotein targets in MGUS/MM is due to an exchange of its regulatory subunits.","abstract":"Hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7 (pP-7) carrier state is the strongest molecularly defined risk factor for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma (MM) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). pP-7 is inherited as autosomal-dominant trait and depending on the ethnic background is found in over one-third of MGUS/MM patients. P-7, which is the antigenic paraprotein target in these patients, is hyperphosphorylated at serine17. P-7 hyperphosphorylation can be induced in wild-type P-7 (wtP-7) carriers by PKC? and reverted by protein-phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Here we show that dephosphorylation of pP-7 is defective in pP-7 carriers due to inactivation of the PP2A by substitution of the regulatory B55? subunit with B56?3. In lymphoblastoid cell lines from pP-7 carriers, transfection of recombinant B55? or treatment with ceramide led to a partial reconstitution of PP2A activity and dephosphorylation of pP-7 to wtP7. Similar results were observed with other previously reported autoantigenic paraproteins targets. In conclusion, the mechanisms responsible for the defective dephosphorylation and maintaining the hyperphosphorylated state of P-7 and other autoantigenic paraprotein targets have been elucidated, facilitating the identification of the genetic basis underlying this phenomenon which is obviously common in the pathogenesis of MGUS/MM/WM and not restricted to pP-7 cases.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676687","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.78281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Ceramide","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramide"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.756237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.691293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Protein kinase C","weight":0.572122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.465752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.417364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Paraprotein","weight":0.287223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraprotein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.244178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy_of_undetermined_significance"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy"},{"name":"Protein phosphatase 2","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_phosphatase_2"},{"name":"Macroglobulinemia","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroglobulinemia"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"HLA-B55","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-B55"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Heckler & Koch P7","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_&_Koch_P7"}]}
