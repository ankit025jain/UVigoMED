{"id":82379,"title":"Total lower lip reconstruction with a double mental neurovascular V-Y island advancement flap.","abstract":"To assess the effectiveness of double mental V-Y island advancement flaps for total lower lip reconstructions.During a 6-year period, from 2006 to 2012, total lower lip reconstruction was performed in 12 patients using double mental V-Y island advanced flaps. The resulting lip function and superiority of each flap were analyzed. To assess any cosmetic implications, patients were asked to answer the Appearance Domain section from the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire at least 12 months after discharge from the hospital.All flaps survived completely and no short-term postoperative complications occurred. The mean follow-up time was 34.5 months (range, 15 to 69 months) and there was no recurrence of disease. All patients were capable of consuming a regular oral diet and no patients complained of an inability to eat in a public setting, drooling, or microstomia. The mean preoperative and postoperative open-mouth widths were 4.1 and 3.7 cm, respectively, and the mean reduced open-mouth width was 10%. The intercommissural width varied from 4.6 to 6.8 cm (mean, 5.5 cm). The mean postoperative 2-point discrimination was 11.2 mm (range, 9 to 13 mm). The mean score for the Appearance Domain section was 93.8 (range, 75 to 100).The mental V-Y island advancement flap reconstruction is a reliable procedure for total lower lip reconstruction.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635858","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"University of Washington","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.307663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Washington (state)","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Microstomia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstomia"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Island","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Park","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park"},{"name":"Drooling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drooling"},{"name":"Double (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Lower lip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_lip"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Holden VY Commodore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_VY_Commodore"}]}
