{"id":74206,"title":"Intraoperative assessment of margins in breast conservative surgery--still in use?","abstract":"A positive margin in breast conserving surgery is associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. Failure to achieve clear margins results in re-excision procedures. Methods for intraoperative assessment of margins have been developed, such as frozen section analysis, touch preparation cytology, near-infrared fluorescence optical imaging, x-ray diffraction technology, high-frequency ultrasound, micro-CT, and radiofrequency spectroscopy. In this article, options that might become the method of choice in the future are discussed.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863286","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Diffraction","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.667473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.567052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.565546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.506151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Optical imaging","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_imaging"},{"name":"Frozen section procedure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_section_procedure"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Food preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_preservation"},{"name":"Failure (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_(band)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Freezing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
