{"id":78276,"title":"[Long-term effects of tinnitus retraining therapy involving monaural noise generators].","abstract":"We have previously reported on the effects of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) involving monaural noise generators (NGs) up to 24 months after the start of treatment (Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2013 Feb; 270(2) : 443-8.) but very few reports exist about the long-term effects of TRT for periods of over 2 years. The aim of this study was to report the effects of TRT involving monaural NGs more than 24 months after the start of treatment. Thirty-three patients with chronic tinnitus were included in this study. All received directive counseling and monaural NGs without any other combination treatment. Effects were evaluated with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) at their final visits to our clinic (average 31 months after the start of treatment). The average THI scores significantly improved from 55.3 +/- 19.7 at baseline to 33.5 +/- 23.3 at their final visits. Seventeen patients (52%) improved by more than 20 points from the baseline. Eleven patients who were treated with TRT for more than 3 years were individually observed in a detailed manner. Some of them experienced aggravation of their symptoms after 2 years' successful treatments. This study suggests that, although TRT seems effective more than 2 years after the start of treatment, the clinical course of each patient can vary and we need to follow them periodically depending on their situations and symptoms.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720159","annotations":[{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.630688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Electric generator","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator"},{"name":"Monaural","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural"},{"name":"Turkish Radio and Television Corporation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Radio_and_Television_Corporation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Professional wrestling match types","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Directive (European Union)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Aggravation (law)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggravation_(law)"},{"name":"Retraining","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraining"},{"name":"UEFA Champions League","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Eleven (TV channel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleven_(TV_channel)"}]}
