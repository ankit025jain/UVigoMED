{"id":35232,"title":"The risk for hyperoxaemia after apnoea, bradycardia and hypoxaemia in preterm infants.","abstract":"To investigate the occurrence and duration of oxygen saturation (SpO?) ?95%, after extra oxygen for apnoea, bradycardia, cyanosis (ABC), and the relation with the duration of bradycardia and/or SpO? ?80%.All preterm infants <32 weeks' gestation supported with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) admitted to our centre were eligible for the study. We retrospectively identified all episodes of ABCs. In ABCs where oxygen supply was increased, duration and severity of bradycardia (<80?bpm), SpO? ?80%, SpO? ?95% and their correlation were investigated.In 56 infants, 257 ABCs occurred where oxygen supply was increased. SpO? ?95% occurred after 79% (202/257) of the ABCs, duration of extra oxygen supply was longer in ABCs with SpO? ?95% than without SpO? ?95% (median (IQR) 20 (8-80) vs 2 (2-3) min; p<0.001)). The duration of SpO? ?95% was longer than bradycardia and SpO? ?80% (median (IQR) 13 (4-30) vs 1 (1-1) vs 2 (1-2) min; p<0.001). SpO? ?95% lasted longer when infants were in ambient air than when oxygen was given before the ABC occurred (median (IQR)15 (5-38) min vs 6 (3-24) min; p<0.01).In preterm infants supported with nCPAP in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), SpO? ?95% frequently occurred when oxygen was increased for ABCs and lasted longer than the bradycardia and SpO? ?80%.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668832","annotations":[{"name":"Bradycardia","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia"},{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Positive airway pressure","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure"},{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.726006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.566711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"American Broadcasting Company","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company"},{"name":"ABC (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(medicine)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Saturation (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
