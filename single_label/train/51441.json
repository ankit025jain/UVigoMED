{"id":51441,"title":"Implications of MGMT methylation status in pituitary adenoma.","abstract":"Very little literature exists on frequency of MGMT methylation status in pituitary adenoma. We assessed the frequency of MGMT methylation and protein expression in pituitary adenoma and correlated with patients' age group and prognosis.Tumor tissues from 30 patients with pituitary adenoma were evaluated for MGMT promoter methylation status by methylation specific PCR method. All tumors were also immunostained with MIB-1, anti-p53 and anti-MGMT antibodies.MGMT methylation status was noted in 40% of cases (7/20 non-functioning adenomas and 5/10 functioning adenomas). MGMT protein expression on IHC was noted in 72.2% of unmethylated tumors, while only 41.6% of methylated tumors demonstrated protein expression. The mean labeling index of MGMT protein was higher in unmethylated tumors as compared to the methylated group, though the difference was not statistically significant (18.6% vs 8.8%; p=0.131). Tumor regrowth occurred in four unmethylated tumors as compared to none in methylated group. Even though there was no correlation between patient age and MGMT methylation status (p=0.823), we noted that the frequency of methylation in middle age patients (between 30 and 59 yrs) was 64.7%, which was higher compared to other age groups.This is the first study from India showing MGMT promoter methylation status with protein expression in pituitary adenoma. We noted that tumor regrowth was higher in unmethylated tumors.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690322","annotations":[{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.813624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.811696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.728055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.596043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.525419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.487637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.355173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"India","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.318346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"MGMT","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGMT"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Middle Ages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages"},{"name":"823","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/823"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"}]}
