{"id":68222,"title":"[Long-term clinical study of thulium laser resection of prostate-tangerine technique in the treatment of begin prostatic hyperplasia].","abstract":"To evaluate the long-term efficacies and complications of thulium laser resection of prostate-tangerine technique (TmLRP-TT) in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).From November 2004 to December 2009, a total of 348 BPH patients undergoing TmLRP-TT at our hospital were evaluated retrospectively for long-term efficacies and complications. The follow-up data included international prostate symptom score (IPSS), quality of life score (QOL), maximum urinary flow (Qmax) and post void urinary residual (PVR).After 4 years, IPSS decreased 70% (22.7 ± 7.7 vs 6.8 ± 5.1) , QOL decreased 65% (4.3 ± 0.7 vs 1.5 ± 1.0), Qmax increased 212% (6.0 ± 2.6 ml/s vs 18.7 ± 4.6 ml/s) and PVR decreased 83% (104.7 ± 34.3 ml vs 17.7 ± 10.7 ml). Cumulative incidences of long-term complications was 6.0% (n = 21), including a second TmLRP-TT due to BPH recurrence (n = 4, 1.2%), urethral stricture (n = 8, 2.3%) and bladder neck contracture (n = 9, 2.6%). Overall, 93% were satisfied with surgical outcomes.TmLRP-TT has excellent efficacies with a low rate of long-term complications. Most patients are satisfied with surgical outcomes.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548448","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.807379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.767708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.64985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.35861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.143501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.115149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Thulium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thulium"},{"name":"Digital video recorder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Masalit language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masalit_language"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"104.7 (Canberra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/104.7_(Canberra)"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Neck of urinary bladder","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_of_urinary_bladder"}]}
