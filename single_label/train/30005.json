{"id":30005,"title":"[Psychiatric complications of cannabis use].","abstract":"Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance, especially among young people. Cannabis use is extremely commonplace and frequently comorbid with psychiatric disorders that raise questions about the etiology. The use of cannabis is an aggravating factor of all psychiatric disorders. Psychiatric complications are related to the age of onset, duration of exposure and individual risk factors of the individual (mental and social health). The panic attack is the most common complication. The link with psychosis is narrow that leads to increased prevention for vulnerable populations. Cannabis is also an indicator of increased depressive vulnerability and an aggravating factor for bipolar disorder.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579344","annotations":[{"name":"Bipolar disorder","weight":0.928167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"},{"name":"Psychosis","weight":0.848647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.826839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Panic attack","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.590093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.342622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.185378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.16113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Panic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Legality of cannabis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis"},{"name":"Age of onset","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_onset"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Vulnerability","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability"},{"name":"Aggravation (law)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggravation_(law)"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"}]}
