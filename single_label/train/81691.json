{"id":81691,"title":"Severity of periodontitis in patients with isolated coronary artery ectasia.","abstract":"The concept that coronary artery ectasia (CAE) is an inflammatory-related disease has been increasingly recognized. Periodontitis induced low-grade chronic systemic inflammation has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between periodontitis and CAE.Thirty-two patients with isolated CAE, and 28 age, sex and smoking status-matched subjects with normal coronary arteries (NCA) underwent full dental examinations. Periodontal disease was evaluated using the following clinical parameters; number of remaining teeth, plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), and pocket depth (PD).Cases and controls did not differ according to their baseline characteristics and prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with isolated CAE had higher periodontal indices when compared to subjects with NCA (PD: 3.6 ± 1.26 mm versus 2.3 ± 0.79 mm; GI: 2.29 ± 0.86 versus 1.43 ± 1.19; BOP (%): 52.18 ± 20.1 versus 27.8 ± 10.9, P < 0.001, P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively). Moreover, in multivariate analysis higher values for PD were found to be significant predictors for the likelihood of having coronary ectasia.The results of the present study demonstrate for the first time that there is an association between periodontitis and isolated CAE.
