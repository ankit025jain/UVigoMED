{"id":40085,"title":"Protective effects of growth hormone on bacterial translocation and intestinal damage in rats with partial intestinal obstruction.","abstract":"One of the reasons of bacterial translocation (BT) is the complete or partial intestinal obstructions (PIO) of the gastrointestinal system. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of recombinant human Growth Hormone (rhGH) on BT in rats with partial intestinal obstruction (PIO).The rats were randomly divided into the 4 groups: Group I: Sham-operated (SO) (n = 12), Group II control PIO (n = 12), Group III: PIO with rhGH treatment for 5 days (n = 12), Group IV: PIO with rhGH treatment 5 days before PIO and 5 days after PIO (a total of 10 days) (n = 12). In the groups III and IV, the effects of 5 and 10 days administered rhGH were examined.The level of serum and of intestinal fluid IgA was significantly higher in the Group IV compared to the Group I, Group II and Group III. In the Group IV, the number of small intestinal goblet and colonic goblet cells, and the lengths of intestinal mucosal villi and crypt depths were statistically significantly higher than in Groups II and III. The rate of bacterial translocation was higher in the Group II: 100 % in MLNs, 41.6 % in blood culture and 50.8 % in the liver cultures, it was significantly higher compared to the other groups (p < 0.01).The study results demonstrated that administration of rhGH to the rats with PIO for at least 10 days decreased bacterial translocation (Fig. 3, Ref. 25).","date":"2014-08-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25077360","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Growth hormone","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Goblet cell","weight":0.765982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblet_cell"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.754552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.669087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Intestinal villus","weight":0.647624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_villus"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.569626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.564437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.549525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.170708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.10542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"}]}
