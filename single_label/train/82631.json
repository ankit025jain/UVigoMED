{"id":82631,"title":"E-cadherin expression and prognosis of oral cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"This study aims to evaluate the association of E-cadherin expression with the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Literature retrieval, selection and assessment, data extraction, and meta-analyses were performed according to the Revman 5.0 guidelines. In the meta-analysis, we utilized either fixed effects or random effects model to pool the HR according to the test of heterogeneity. A total of nine eligible studies included 973 OSCC patients were analyzed. Of the patients, 76.3 % had low expression of E-cadherin according to the cutoff value defined by the authors. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) of low expression of E-cadherin for overall survival (OS) was 0.65 (95 % CI 0.52 to 0.80, P<0.001); in Asian population, the HR for overall survival of the patients with reduced expression of E-cadherin was 0.84 (95 % CI 0.75 to 0.95, P=0.006), and in non-Asian population, the HR for overall survival of the patients with reduced expression of E-cadherin was 0.54 (95 % CI 0.41 to 0.69, P<0.001). Patients with reduced expression of E-cadherin appear to have a poorer OS compared with those with normal or higher expression of E-cadherin.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573611","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.806754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.515992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.472176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.452522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.446041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.431881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.37361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.370553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.247521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.135186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Operating system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"973","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/973"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Data extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_extraction"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Fixed effects model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Swimming pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
