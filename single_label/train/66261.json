{"id":66261,"title":"[Uretero(reno)scopy: management of complications].","abstract":"Rigid and flexible uretero(reno)scopy (URS) are safe and effective methods in interventional calculus therapy. Complications are rare and can be avoided in advance in many cases. In ureteroliths, URS has in many cases replaced extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) as the method of first choice. However, it is important to describe in detail the advantages and disadvantages as well as the risks of the procedure to the patient.
