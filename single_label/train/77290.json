{"id":77290,"title":"Work-related musculoskeletal disorders in senior farmers: safety and health considerations.","abstract":"Aging farmers are at high risk musculoskeletal disorders due to occupational exposures. The development of musculoskeletal conditions can increase older farmers' risk for additional injuries because many older farmers continue to work past typical retirement age. Occupational health nurses with agricultural expertise can assist farmers by evaluating their health and safety needs. Possible interventions include ergonomic improvements in farm equipment, safety improvements in farm environment, and referrals to programs that assist older farmers in modifying their farms to improve safety.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25191676","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.686959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.639143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.601239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.576941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.387514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.308642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.210498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.144383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Ergonomics","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics"},{"name":"Retirement","weight":0.0591548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"List of agricultural machinery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_agricultural_machinery"},{"name":"Exposure assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_assessment"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"}]}
