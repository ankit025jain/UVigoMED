{"id":38518,"title":"Office-based lower airway endoscopy (OLAE) in pediatric patients: a high-value procedure.","abstract":"Office-based lower airway endoscopy (OLAE) is not a widespread practice in children due to concerns about its safety and efficacy. In 2003, we reported on OLAE in 105 children presenting with airway symptoms and found it both safe and effective as a diagnostic tool. The current study is a follow-up to the 2003 study that reports on an additional 122 pediatric patients who received OLAE with special attention to the safety and efficacy of the procedure.A retrospective review at a tertiary-quaternary pediatric institution of 122 consecutive pediatric patients in which an airway lesion, by history and initial physical exam, was determined to be present at the level of the supraglottic larynx to the carina. In all patients, airway endoscopy was performed in the office using flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFL) and the endoscope was passed beyond the glottis to assess the lower airway, including the subglottis, trachea, and carina. The diagnoses were recorded and the number of times each diagnosis was encountered as well as the percent of patients who had each diagnosis was calculated. All cases requiring operating room procedures for further diagnosis or therapy were assessed for office-based and operating room diagnostic agreement. The ease of performing the lower airway assessment and the ease with which the subglottis, trachea, and carina were visualized were graded. An assessment for complications was also performed.There were no complications with OLAE in any of the 122 patients. The percent of patients rated as having good visualization of anatomic structures were: 97% for visualization of the subglottis, 98% for visualization of the trachea, and 92% for visualization of the carina. In 93% of the cases the procedure was easily performed. There was excellent correlation between OLAE and operative endoscopy.OLAE continues to be a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective tool for the diagnosis of lower airway pathology in pediatric patients.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418184","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Laryngoscopy","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.567881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.4941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.307159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Glottis","weight":0.305556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.133892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
