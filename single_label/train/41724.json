{"id":41724,"title":"[Use of oral drugs and short bowel syndrome: an analysis of practices].","abstract":"To describe drug prescription patterns in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS).The drug prescriptions of patients suffering from SBS type 1 to 3 were compared.Seventy-nine percent of the drugs were prescribed by oral route, and this proportion was significantly higher in patients with type 3 compared to tose with type 1. Twenty-nine percent of prescriptions were dietary supplement-drugs, 14.3% were gastrointestinal drugs and 11.4% were cardiovascular drugs. Oral prescription medications for SBS concerned many drug categories. The number of gastrointestinal or dietary supplement drugs was comparable between the 3 types. Drug doses were not increased compared with the recommendations, except for gastrointestinal drugs.The oral administration is common and at usual dosage in patients with SBS despite a lack of studies on absorption that may help to individualize drug prescription.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901291","annotations":[{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.716491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.585652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.463391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Short bowel syndrome","weight":0.401208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.391724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.387979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.243833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"}]}
