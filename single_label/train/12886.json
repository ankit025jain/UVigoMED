{"id":12886,"title":"Tumor promoter-induced sulfiredoxin is required for mouse skin tumorigenesis.","abstract":"Sulfiredoxin (Srx), the exclusive enzyme that reduces the hyperoxidized inactive form of peroxiredoxins (Prxs), has been found highly expressed in several types of human skin cancer. To determine whether Srx contributed to skin tumorigenesis in vivo, Srx null mice were generated on an FVB background. Mouse skin tumorigenesis was induced by a 7,12-dimethylbenz[?]anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (DMBA/TPA) protocol. We found that the number, volume and size of papillomas in Srx(-/-) mice were significantly fewer compared with either wild-type (Wt) or heterozygous (Het) siblings. Histopathological analysis revealed more apoptotic cells in tumors from Srx(-/-) mice. Mechanistic studies in cell culture revealed that Srx was stimulated by TPA in a redox-independent manner. This effect was mediated transcriptionally through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Jun-N-terminal kinase. We also demonstrated that Srx was capable of reducing hyperoxidized Prxs to facilitate cell survival under oxidative stress conditions. These findings suggested that loss of Srx protected mice, at least partially, from DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumorigenesis. Therefore, Srx has an oncogenic role in skin tumorigenesis and targeting Srx may provide novel strategies for skin cancer prevention or treatment.
