{"id":76998,"title":"Nutrient intake and growth indices for children at kindergartens in Shiraz, Iran.","abstract":"To evaluate energy and nutrient intake and determine growth indices for pre-school children in Iran.The study was conducted from June to September 2010 and included 150 children aged between 3 and 5 years who attended kindergartens in Shiraz, Iran. Following a measurement of the participants' height and weight, three 24-hour dietary recalls were completed based on interviews with their parents. The data was entered into various computer softwares. The prevalence of underweight, stunting, wasting, at-risk-of-overweight and overweight children was then calculated, and energy and nutrient intake was compared with the recommended values.The mean intake of energy, calcium and iron for the children were less than the recommended values. In contrast, the mean intakes of carbohydrate, protein, zinc and vitamin C were higher than the recommendations. Fat intake, however, was within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range. In addition, the rates of prevalence of the underweight, stunting, wasting, and overweight or at-risk-of-overweight were found to be 27 (18.6%), 37 (25.5%), 18 (12.4%) and 34 (23.4%), respectively. Finally, underweight children had lower intake of energy, carbohydrate, protein, fat, iron and zinc, while overweight or at-risk-of-overweight ones had higher intake of protein, calcium and zinc.There is a need for children in kindergartens of Shiraz to improve their mean intake of energy, calcium and iron. Moreover, about one-fourth of the children were stunted and about the same proportion were either overweight or at the risk of being so.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864607","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.821865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.764248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.74019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.735806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.544842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.410752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.361872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.303126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Underweight","weight":0.122269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underweight"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.055809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Climatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology"},{"name":"Cachexia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cachexia"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Childhood obesity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_obesity"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"}]}
