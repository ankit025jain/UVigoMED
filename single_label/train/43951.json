{"id":43951,"title":"High rates of early treatment discontinuation in hepatitis C-infected US veterans.","abstract":"Patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) frequently discontinued dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) before reaching the recommended duration of 48 or 24 weeks for genotypes (G) 1/4 or 2/3, respectively. We quantified rates of discontinuation despite efficacy (non-LOE) versus lack of efficacy (LOE) versus discontinuation for unknown reasons in a national database of United States veterans.We identified a population-based cohort of U.S. veterans with encounters from 2004 through 2009 who had lab-confirmed HCV infection and initiated therapy with Peg-IFN plus RBV in Veterans Health Administration medical centers. Pharmacy data were used to determine therapy duration, defined as the sum of Peg-IFN days supplied. Patients \"discontinued\" if they failed to receive at least 44 (G1/4) or 20 weeks (G2/3) of therapy. We classified discontinuations as due to non-LOE, LOE, or unknown reasons using a classification rule based on treatment duration and laboratory confirmed response.Of 321,238 diagnosed HCV patients during the evaluation period, 9.7% initiated therapy and 6.4% met all other inclusion criteria. 54.9% of patients discontinued early; of these, 41.2% discontinued due to non-LOE reasons, 12.5% discontinued for LOE reasons, and 46.3% discontinued for unknown reasons. Among non-LOE discontinuers, most (60.1%) discontinued in the first 4 weeks of therapy, which constitutes 13.6% of all treated patients.We observed a high proportion of early discontinuations with dual-therapy regimens in a national cohort of HCV-infected veterans. If this trend persists in the triple-therapy era, then efforts must be undertaken to improve adherence.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758162","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.802167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.714429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.592341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.579299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.34327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.310159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.301105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Veterans Health Administration","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration"},{"name":"Health administration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_administration"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Veteran","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"238","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/238"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Districts of Mongolia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Mongolia"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.016226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Statistical classification","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Government database","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_database"},{"name":"List of highest playoff series scoring averages in National Basketball Association history","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_playoff_series_scoring_averages_in_National_Basketball_Association_history"}]}
