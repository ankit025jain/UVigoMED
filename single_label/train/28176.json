{"id":28176,"title":"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and substance abuse.","abstract":"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders are inextricablyÂ intertwined. Children with ADHD are more likely than peers to develop substance use disorders. Treatment with stimulants may reduce the risk of substance use disorders, but stimulants are a class of medication with significant abuse and diversion potential. The objectives of this clinical report were to present practical strategies for reducing the risk of substance use disorders in patients with ADHD and suggestions for safe stimulant prescribing.
