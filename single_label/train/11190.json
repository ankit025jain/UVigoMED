{"id":11190,"title":"A single viral gene determines lethal cross-species neurovirulence of baboon herpesvirus HVP2.","abstract":"Alpha-herpesviruses can produce more severe infections in non-natural host species than in their natural host. Isolates of the baboon alpha-herpesvirus Papiine herpesvirus 2 (HVP2) are either very neurovirulent in mice (subtype nv) or non-virulent (subtype ap), but no such difference is evident in the natural baboon host. Comparative genome sequencing was used to identify subtype-specific sequence differences (SSDs) between HVP2nv and HVP2ap isolates. Some genes were identified that despite exhibiting sequence variation among isolates did not have any SSDs, while other genes had comparatively high levels of SSDs. Construction of genomic recombinants between HVP2nv and HVP2ap isolates mapped the mouse neurovirulence determinant to within three genes. Construction of gene-specific recombinants demonstrated that the UL39 ORF is responsible for determining the lethal neurovirulence phenotype of HVP2 in mice. These results demonstrate that differences in a single viral gene can determine the severity of herpesvirus infection in a non-natural host species.
