{"id":69301,"title":"[Influences of solar and geomagnetic activity on health status of people with various nosological forms of diseases].","abstract":"Statistical analysis of correlation between heliogeophysical factors and a symptom of the various forms of diseases (based on statistical data on disease of the personnel of Irkutsk Scientific Centre, RAS) has been studied. It is shown that geomagnetic storms influence vegetative regulation of a cardiac rhythm and vascular tone. The most serious consequences of such influence can mainly be observed in the persons suffering from diseases of the cardiovascular system (consequences of myocardium attack, brain strokes, cardiac rhythm disorders); being in a condition of additional stress, mainly with vegetovascular and hypertensic crises; having mental diseases; and subject to aggravations of general diseases (chronic inflammatory diseases of gynecological, musculoskeletal, urinary excretory, bronchopulmonary systems, and systems of digestive organs).","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455893","annotations":[{"name":"Nosology","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Cardiovascular system","weight":0.801736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_system"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Vascular resistance","weight":0.481416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_resistance"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.394889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Sinus rhythm","weight":0.369061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_rhythm"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.356148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.310454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Vegetative reproduction","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetative_reproduction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Earth's magnetic field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"}]}
