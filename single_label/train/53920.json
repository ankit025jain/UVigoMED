{"id":53920,"title":"Lymphovascular space invasion in microcystic elongated and fragmented (MELF)-pattern well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma is associated with a higher rate of lymph node metastasis.","abstract":"The microcystic elongated and fragmented (MELF) pattern of myoinvasion is a feature of some well-differentiated endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas that has been associated with poor prognosis. The myoinvasion in MELF-pattern tumors can be subtle and lead to underestimation of the depth of myometrial invasion resulting in tumor understaging; the presence of lymphvascular space invasion (LVSI) and lymph node metastasis in MELF-pattern tumors can also be subtle and lead to tumor understaging. To investigate the association of MELF-pattern invasion and lymph node metastasis, we reviewed a series of well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinomas and correlated the presence of MELF-pattern myoinvasion and LVSI with lymph node metastasis. Cases of T1 stage well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinomas with LVSI and a concurrent lymph node dissection were identified from departmental files. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from the hysterectomy specimen and lymph nodes were reviewed for the presence of MELF-pattern myoinvasion, LVSI, and nodal metastasis. MELF-pattern myoinvasion was identified at least focally in 36% of cases. The pattern of LVSI differed between cases with MELF-pattern invasion and conventional-type invasion, as did the pattern of nodal metastasis. A statistically significantly higher rate of lymph node metastasis was present in cases with MELF-pattern invasion than in cases with conventional invasion, and the rate stratified with the proportion of MELF-pattern adenocarcinomas. MELF-pattern cases carry an increased rate of lymph node metastasis even within the subset of endometrioid tumors with LVSI, which has implications in routine clinical practice as it signals the importance of recognizing MELF-pattern myoinvasion.
