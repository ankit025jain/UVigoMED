{"id":43017,"title":"Randomised clinical trial: A liquid multi-strain probiotic vs. placebo in the irritable bowel syndrome--a 12 week double-blind study.","abstract":"The importance of interactions between the host and gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is becoming increasingly apparent. Probiotics offer a potential new treatment for IBS, but current results are conflicting, largely as a result of poorly designed trials and nonstandardisation of outcome measures.To assess the efficacy of a liquid, multi-strain probiotic (Symprove) in IBS.A single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with symptomatic IBS. Patients received 12 weeks of treatment with the probiotic or placebo (1 mL/kg/day). The primary efficacy measure was the difference in change in the IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) between probiotic vs. placebo at week 12. Secondary outcome measures included change in the IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL) score and change in the IBS-SSS symptom component scores.A total of 186 patients were randomised and 152 patients completed the study. The mean change in IBS-SSS was -63.3 probiotic vs. -28.3 placebo. The mean difference in the IBS-SSS was statistically significant [-35.0 (95% CI; -62.03, -7.87); P = 0.01]. There was no significant improvement in the IBS-QOL. No serious adverse events were reported.The multi-strain probiotic was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall symptom severity in patients with IBS, and was well tolerated. These results suggest this probiotic confers benefit in IBS and deserves further investigation (ISRCTN identifier: 77512412).","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24815298","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.906582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.744892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.57921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.34328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.291964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
