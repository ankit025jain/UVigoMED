{"id":45456,"title":"The role of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in colorectal cancer.","abstract":"HMGB1, the most important member of the high mobility group box protein family, is a nuclear protein with different functions in the cell; it has a role in cancer progression, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis development. We studied the expression of HMGB1 and whether it is a prognostic factor in colorectal carcinoma.The study included 110 cases that were histopathologically diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma from the tissue samples acquired by surgical resection and biopsy in Antalya Education and Research Hospital between 2008 and 2012. HMGB1 expression was examined via immunohistochemical method.HMGB1 expression was evaluated as negative in 32 (44.4%) of the patients and as positive in 40 (55.6%) patients. There was no relation between the HMGB1 expression and sex, age, tumor invasion depth, and histological type. However, a significant relation was detected between the HMGB1 expression and lymph node status, metastasis status, and stage (p:<0.001, p:<0.001, p:<0.001, respectively). Similar results were obtained for the relations between the HMGB1 and histological grade, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and lymphocytic response (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively).The results of our study demonstrate that HMGB1 overexpression has a significant role in tumor progression (especially migration of tumor cells) and tumor ability to metastasize in colorectal cancers; thus, it corroborates the idea that it might be an important prognostic factor.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681824","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.844756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.802427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.763568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.742775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.729956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.706397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.706275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.645814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.620407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.611357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.282513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"HMGB1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGB1"},{"name":"Perineural invasion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perineural_invasion"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
