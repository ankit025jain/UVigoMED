{"id":61771,"title":"Open-label, single-arm, phase II study of enzastaurin in patients with follicular lymphoma.","abstract":"This open-label, phase II study investigated whether enzastaurin, a protein kinase C-beta (PKC?) inhibitor, had activity in patients with grade 1 or 2 follicular lymphoma (FL). Adults with grade 1 or 2 FL who had no more than one prior treatment received oral enzastaurin continuously for up to 3 years. Of the 66 patients who received enzastaurin, 53 were evaluable for response. Overall response rate (ORR, primary efficacy endpoint) was 26.4% (3.8% complete response). Median (95% confidence interval) progression-free survival, time to response, and duration of response were 18.1 (11.5-28.3), 4.9 (2.8-8.1), and 22.3 (8.8-not applicable) months, respectively. In patients with tumour tissue available for biomarker analysis, ORRs in low versus high PKC?2 expression groups were 41.7% and 8.3%, respectively (P = 0.041). The most common, mainly low-grade drug-related adverse events were fatigue (25.8%), diarrhoea (25.8%), nausea (18.2%), and chromaturia (18.2%). Four (6.1%) patients had Grade 3 toxicity and one (1.5%) patient had Grade 4 toxicity. Enzastaurin demonstrated limited clinical activity in grade 1 or 2 FL. Patients with low PKC?2 expression in tumours had higher ORR than those with high PKC?2 expression. Enzastaurin was well tolerated with mostly grade 1 or 2 toxicities. Further studies may be warranted in select patient populations.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673609","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.918735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.908934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Follicular lymphoma","weight":0.609824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_lymphoma"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.588333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.485294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.378154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.233121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Protein kinase C","weight":0.0909078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"}]}
