{"id":51415,"title":"Nociceptive neurons differentially express fast and slow T-type Ca²? currents in different types of diabetic neuropathy.","abstract":"T-type Ca²? channels are known as important participants of nociception and their remodeling contributes to diabetes-induced alterations of pain sensation. In this work we have established that about 30% of rat nonpeptidergic thermal C-type nociceptive (NTCN) neurons of segments L4-L6 express a slow T-type Ca²? current (T-current) while a fast T-current is expressed in the other 70% of these neurons. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes in young rats resulted in thermal hyperalgesia, hypoalgesia, or normalgesia 5-6 weeks after the induction. Our results show that NTCN neurons obtained from hyperalgesic animals do not express the slow T-current. Meanwhile, the fraction of neurons expressing the slow T-current did not significantly change in the hypo- and normalgesic diabetic groups. Moreover, the peak current density of fast T-current was significantly increased only in the neurons of hyperalgesic group. In contrast, the peak current density of slow T-current was significantly decreased in the hypo- and normalgesic groups. Experimental diabetes also resulted in a depolarizing shift of steady-state inactivation of fast T-current in the hyperalgesic group and slow T-current in the hypo- and normalgesic groups. We suggest that the observed changes may contribute to expression of different types of peripheral diabetic neuropathy occurring during the development of diabetes mellitus.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693454","annotations":[{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.874172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.852729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Depolarization","weight":0.584836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.453327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Hyperalgesia","weight":0.434851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperalgesia"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.343501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.329404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.26286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.257987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Diabetic neuropathy","weight":0.193284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Ctype.h","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctype.h"},{"name":"Current density","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_density"},{"name":"Barcelona Metro line 4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Metro_line_4"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Thermal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Barcelona Metro line 6","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Metro_line_6"}]}
