{"id":83057,"title":"Root resorption, treatment time and extraction rate during orthodontic treatment with self-ligating and conventional brackets.","abstract":"This study determined the amount and severity of EARR (external apical root resorption) after orthodontic treatment with self-ligating (SL) and conventional (Non-SL) brackets. Differences regarding rate of extraction cases, appointments and treatment time were evaluated.213 patients with a mean age of 12.4?±?2.2 years were evaluated retrospectively. The treatments were performed with SL brackets (n?=?139, Smartclip, 3 M Unitek, USA) or Non-SL brackets (n?=?74, Victory Series, 3 M Unitek, USA). Measurements of the crown and root length of the incisors were taken using panoramic radiographs. Three-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for an appliance effect.There was no difference between patients treated with Non-SL or SL brackets regarding the amount (in percentage) of EARR (Non-SL: 4.5?±?6.6 vs. SL: 3.0?±?5.6). Occurrence of severe EARR (sEARR) did also not differ between the two groups (Non-SL 0.5 vs. SL: 0.3). The percentage of patients with need of tooth extraction for treatment (Non SL: 8.1 vs. SL: 6.9) and the number of appointments (Non-SL: 12.4?±?3.4 vs. SL: 13.9?±?3.3) did not show any differences. The treatment time was shorter with Non-SL brackets (Non-SL: 18.1?±?5.3 vs. SL: 20.7?±?4.9 months).This is the largest study showing that there is no difference in the amount of EARR, number of appointments and extraction rate between conventional and self-ligating brackets. For the first time we could demonstrate that occurrence of sEARR does not differ between the two types of brackets.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456620","annotations":[{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.635092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.457549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Root resorption","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_resorption"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.114166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0813771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"3M","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Panorama","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panorama"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"},{"name":"Bracket (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(architecture)"},{"name":"Fish measurement","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_measurement"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
