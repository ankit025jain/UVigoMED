{"id":80154,"title":"Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) binding fraction from Taenia solium metacestode improves the neurocysticercosis serodiagnosis.","abstract":"Neurocysticercosis (NC) is one of the most important diseases caused by parasites affecting the central nervous system. We fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography using diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-sepharose resin the total saline extract (S) from Taenia solium metacestodes and evaluated obtained fractions (DEAE S1 and DEAE S2) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, n?=?123) and immunoblotting (IB, n?=?22) to detect human NC in serum. Diagnostic parameters were established by ROC and TG ROC curves for ELISA tests. IB was qualitatively analyzed. S and DEAE S1 presented sensitivity of 87. 5% and DEAE S2 90%. The best specificity was observed for DEAE S2 (90.4%). In IB, using DEAE S2 samples from NC patients presented bands of 20-25, 43-45, 55-50, 60-66, 82, 89, and 140 kDa. The great diagnostic parameters reached by DEAE S2 suggest the potential applicability of this fraction in NC immunodiagnosis.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777340","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Taenia solium","weight":0.748817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_solium"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.549718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.476225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.307594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.275104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Triethylamine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triethylamine"},{"name":"Neurocysticercosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocysticercosis"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"North Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"2025","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diethylaminoethyl cellulose","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylaminoethyl_cellulose"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"International Baccalaureate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate"}]}
