{"id":25892,"title":"[Dipper, non-dipper pattern].","abstract":"The circadian rhythms of blood pressure is regulated by various mechanisms, such as the autonomic nerve system, the renin-angiotensin system and hormones. Non-dippers are defined as those with a nighttime blood pressure reduction of less than 10% of daytime blood pressure. Many reports say that non-dippers have increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is a useful tool for diagnostic and management of abnormal blood pressure variability in hypertensive individuals. Antihypertensive agents have the potential to provide blood pressure control of non-dipper patients. 24-hour blood pressure control with ABPM may be necessary for patients to get better prognosis by blood pressure lowering therapy.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167742","annotations":[{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.886361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.875712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.609297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.487328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Circadian rhythm","weight":0.476569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.466709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ambulatory blood pressure","weight":0.32545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_blood_pressure"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ambulatory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Pressure flaking","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_flaking"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Dipper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipper"}]}
