{"id":86553,"title":"Postradiation hypertrichosis: a paradox.","abstract":"Alopecia due to radiation has remained a widely accepted aspect of radiotherapy. We present an unexpected clinical scenario, where a patient with left lung stage IIIB nonsmall cell adenocarcinoma, treated with radiochemotherapy achieved a complete response and developed an obscure late effect in terms of paradoxical hypertrichosis in the radiation portals. The paper presents plausible hypothesis for this unusual phenomenon.
