{"id":62593,"title":"Systemic mastocytosis with associated myeloproliferative neoplasm with t(8;19)(p12;q13.1) and abnormality of FGFR1: report of a unique case.","abstract":"Systemic mastocytosis is a neoplastic proliferation of mast cells that frequently presents with associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease. Myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with abnormalities of the FGFR1 gene are a heterogenous group of rare and aggressive hematopoietic stem cell disorders. About a dozen of chromosome changes involving the FGFR1 gene, presenting as myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms, have been described in the literature. To date, only 2 cases of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with abnormalities of the FGFR1 gene have been reported in association with systemic mastocytosis, one with t(8;13) and one with t(8;17) involving the FGFR1 gene. Here we describe another case of myeloproliferative neoplasm with chromosome translocation t(8;19) involving FGFR1 gene associated with systemic mastocytosis.
