{"id":47079,"title":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms and susceptibility to esophageal cancer in Chinese populations: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Although many epidemiologic studies investigated the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms and their associations with esophageal cancer, definite conclusions could not be drawn. To clarify the effects of MTHFR polymorphisms on the risk of esophageal cancer, a meta-analysis was here performed in Chinese populations. A total of 16 studies including 3,040 cases and 4,127 controls were involved in this meta- analysis. Overall, significant associations were found between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and esophageal cancer risk when all studies in Chinese populations were pooled into the meta-analysis (T vs. C, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.06-1.34; TT vs. CC, OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.07-1.70; TT+ CT vs. CC, OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.08-1.54; TT vs. CC + CT, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.03-1.37). In subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity and source of controls, the same results were found in Kazakh (TT vs. CC, OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.02-1.87; TT + CT vs. CC, OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.03-2.18), in not stated populations (T vs. C, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.42; TT vs. CC, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.10-1.96; TT + CT vs. CC, OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.05-1.60; TT vs. CC + CT, OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.12-1.56), and in hospital-based studies (T vs. C, OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.19-1.51; TT vs. CC, OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.37-2.39; TT + CT vs. CC, OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.26-1.83; and TT vs. CC + CT, OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.13-1.70). In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism contributes to esophageal cancer development in Chinese populations.
