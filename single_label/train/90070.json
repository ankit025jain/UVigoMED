{"id":90070,"title":"[Treatment of unstable middle 1/3 of clavicular fractures with composite external fixator in adult patients].","abstract":"To explore methods and clinical effects of composite external fixtor in treating adult patients with unstable middle 1/3 of clavicular fractures.From March 2008 to March 2011,36 patients with unstable middle 1/3 of clavicular fractures were treated with composite external fixtor. There were 24 males and 12 females, aged from 18 to 55 years old with an average of 43 years old. Twenty cases on the left side and 16 cases on the right side. Time from injury to operation was 2 to 6 days (averaged 3.5 days). According to Robinson classification, there were 7 cases with type 2A2, 18 cases with type 2B1, and 11 cases with type 2B2. No vessels and nerve damage occurred before opreation. The clinical effects were evaluated according to Neer scoring.All cases were followed up from 6 to 12 months with an average of 8 months. The mean Neer score was 88.3 +/- 6.2, which included pain 31.6 +/- 3.2, functional score 25.7 +/- 2.2, range of motion score 21.1 +/- 1.7, and anatomy score 8.8 +/- 0.8. There were 22 cases in excellent, good in 13, fair in 1. Two cases occurred pin tract infection.Composite external fixtor is an optional method in treating unstable middle 1/3 of clavicular fracture, and can obtain a good clinical effects.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654522","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.429081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.416327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Clavicle fracture","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle_fracture"},{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.259472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.253023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Professional wrestling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"1 decametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decametre"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Second baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Neer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neer"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
