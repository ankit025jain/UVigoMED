{"id":81106,"title":"Recovery of Cyclospora cayetanensis among asymptomatic rural Thai schoolchildren.","abstract":"To obtain the prevalence with clinical symptoms of Cyclospora cayetanensis (C. cayetanensis), a coccidian protozoan parasite, in Thailand which is the cause of an intestinal infection characterized by sporadic-to-frequent explosive diarrhea.In a field survey conducted by the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, as part of the existing parasite-control program, a total of 2 540 faecal samples from villagers in Nan Province, Thailand, were collected and examined to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of parasitic infections.Twelve cases of C. cayetanensis infection were found during faecal examination of schoolchildren aged 5-12 years. None exhibited obvious clinical symptoms, especially evidence of diarrhea; 5 of 12 had loose faeces, one reported frequent symptoms of abdominal discomfort, and another had pale conjunctiva with low hematocrit. The children were generally asymptomatic.This finding confirms a public-health issue with potentially serious consequences whereby children can be exposed to an environment contaminated with food-and water-borne transmitted oocysts, and can hence become infected with C. cayetanensis.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461524","annotations":[{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.917494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.817494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Protozoa","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.779626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mahidol University","weight":0.576707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahidol_University"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.530251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"},{"name":"Intestinal parasite","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_parasite"},{"name":"Tropics","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Coccidia","weight":0.174872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidia"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.103847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Tropical medicine","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_medicine"},{"name":"Explosive material","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_material"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Nan Province","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nan_Province"},{"name":"Cyclospora cayetanensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclospora_cayetanensis"},{"name":"Waterborne diseases","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterborne_diseases"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Grandparent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandparent"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"}]}
