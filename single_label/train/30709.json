Presence of other substances like amphetamine, cannabinoids, atropine, ephedrine, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and dextrometorphan was confirmed. The most frequent clinical symptoms observed on admission were: anxiety, agitation, complaints associated with circulatory system and vertigo Average pulse rate and both: diastolic and systolic pressure were within normal limits, however authors noted slight tendency toward tachycardia. One patients died due to multiorgan failure. Average period of hospitalization amounted 2.24 days. Co-poisoning with ethanol was associated with higher frequency of circulatory system disturbances.Clinical pattern of poisoning with novel drugs could partially correspond with mild sympathomime. tic syndrome.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466685","annotations":[{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Carbamazepine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine"},{"name":"Atropine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropine"},{"name":"Ephedrine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrine"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Tachycardia","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Benzodiazepine","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Psychomotor agitation","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomotor_agitation"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.713286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.585769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tic","weight":0.546007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.489279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Substance intoxication","weight":0.454162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.32493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"God","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"}]}
