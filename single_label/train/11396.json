{"id":11396,"title":"Lactones from Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. reduces atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-deficient mice via inhibiting over expression of NF-kB-dependent adhesion molecules.","abstract":"The present study aims to investigate the anti-atherosclerotic effects of lactones extracted from Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort (LLC) in apoE-deficient mice (ApoE(-/-) mice) and proclaim its underlying mechanisms. Expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and NF-?B around the atherosclerotic lesions was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). To further validate the mechanism, effect of LLC on the secretion of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced by tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?) was measured by ELISA. And the activation of NF-?B was detected by western blot. Mice treated with LLC showed significant reduction in lesion sizes of thoracic segments of the aorta (p<0.01). Meanwhile, LLC treatments lead to decreases of serum TG, TC and LDL-C contents, respectively. LLC also decreased the expression of CD31, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-?B) in the atherosclerotic plaque. Moreover, LLC at 3.125-25 ?g/mL can dose-dependently attenuate the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in TNF-? stimulated HUVECs. Western blot result indicated LLC inhibited activation of NF-?B. These results suggested that LLC could ameliorate atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice. The mechanism of action of LLC on anti-atherosclerotic effect may be attributed to the suppression of the production of NF-?B-dependent adhesion molecules.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594239","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.798868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"CCL2","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL2"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.748291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.728732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.687537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.666711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.658329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.655767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"VCAM-1","weight":0.612649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCAM-1"},{"name":"CD31","weight":0.603042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD31"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.552477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Atheroma","weight":0.507826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheroma"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.371201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein E","weight":0.349399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Adhesion","weight":0.230747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.144683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.031705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Thyroglobulin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroglobulin"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
