{"id":4520,"title":"[Effect of different types of cold acclimation on osmotic fragility and sphericity index of rat erythrocytes].","abstract":"The effect of different types of cold exposures, long-term and rhythmically organized (RCE), which increased organism adaptive ability to cold, on osmotic fragility and sphericity index of rat erythrocytes were studied. It is shown that depending on the type, intensity and duration of cold exposure the change of sphericity index occurred. More over, RCE1 (exposure temperature -12 째C, during 2 days) led to the increase in osmotic fragility, but RCE2 (exposure temperature 10 째C, during 2 days), RCE3 (exposure temperature 10 째C, during 1 month) and long-term (exposure temperature 5 째C, during 1 month) - to membrane modification without change in its osmotic fragility.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464726","annotations":[{"name":"Organism","weight":0.766704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.42408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Osmosis","weight":0.321274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Osmotic fragility","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_fragility"},{"name":"Acclimatization","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Canadian Military Engineers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Military_Engineers"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
