{"id":51234,"title":"IL-34 is associated with obesity, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance.","abstract":"IL-34 is a recently identified alternative ligand for colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor. IL-34 and CSF-1 are regulators of differentiation, proliferation, and survival in mononuclear phagocytes. Here, we investigated the IL-34 serum concentration and expression in human adipose tissues and any associations with insulin resistance.We recruited 19 nondiabetic obese women, 9 type 2 diabetic women, and 27 normal-weight women. Metabolic parameters, abdominal fat distribution, serum IL-34 concentration, and IL-34 mRNA expression were measured in abdominal sc adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). In addition, the expression/secretion and putative effects of IL-34 were assessed in human differentiated adipocytes. Serum IL-34 concentration was measured before and 5 to 9 months after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery was performed on the 20 obese patients.Regardless of diabetes status, obese patients demonstrated significantly higher serum IL-34 concentrations than controls. Serum IL-34 was significantly and positively correlated with insulin resistance-related metabolic parameters. IL-34 mRNA was significantly higher in VAT than SAT. IL-34 was expressed in adipocytes as well as nonadipocytes, and expression was significantly higher during adipogenesis. In differentiated adipocytes, the expression/secretion of IL-34 was enhanced by TNF? and IL-1?. In addition, IL-34 augmented fat accumulation and inhibited the stimulatory effects of insulin on glucose transport. Moreover, serum IL-34 was significantly decreased after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass-induced weight loss.The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that IL-34 is expressed in human adipose tissues and the circulating concentration is significantly elevated in obese patients. This suggests that IL-34 is associated with insulin resistance.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Endocrine System
