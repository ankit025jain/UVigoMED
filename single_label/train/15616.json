{"id":15616,"title":"Reduction of risk of Salmonella infection from kitchen cleaning clothes by use of sodium hypochlorite disinfectant cleaner.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction of infection risk due to exposure to Salmonella sp. in kitchen cleaning clothes by the use of a bleach (sodium hypochlorite) cleaner utilizing a continuous-time dynamic exposure model. The only route of exposure considered was hand contamination during cloth use. The occurrence and numbers of Salmonella was studied in 60 homes over a 6-week period in which half disinfected kitchen cleaning clothes with a sodium hypochlorite based disinfectant cleaner. This study demonstrated that a significant risk exists for Salmonella infection from kitchen cleaning clothes in Mexican homes and that this risk can be reduced by almost 100-fold by soaking cleaning clothes in a bleach product. The risks of infection and illness could likely be further reduced by developing a more effective procedure for reducing Salmonella in cleaning clothes treated twice a day with a sodium hypochlorite disinfectant (i.e. longer soaking time) or using a greater concentration of the disinfectant.Hygiene intervention is a key strategy to reduce the potential risk of disease-causing micro-organisms in households. There is a lack of understanding of the human health risk associated with the use of contaminated kitchen cleaning cloths. The study used a quantitative microbial risk assessment to estimate the risk associated with the use of kitchen cleaning clothes by using disinfectant products. The results showed that the use of prescribe protocols can reduce the risk of Salmonella infections in household kitchens.","date":"2014-10-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163762","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium hypochlorite","weight":0.83444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Bleach","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.729809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Salmonella","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Textile","weight":0.510689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.383733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Mexico","weight":0.351181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"},{"name":"Kitchen","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Detergent","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hypochlorite","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorite"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
