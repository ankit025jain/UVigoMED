{"id":53200,"title":"GATA6, SF1, NGFIB and DAX1 in the remodeled subcapsular zones in primary aldosteronism.","abstract":"The majority of the cases diagnosed as primary aldosteronism (PA) are caused by aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) or idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA). Histopathologically, both IHA and adjacent adrenal glands of APA demonstrate remodeled subcapsular zone (RSZ) but these zones in two disorders are markedly different in terms of steroidogenesis. 3?-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/??-?? isomerase (3?-HSD) expression has been known to be activated synergistically by GATA6 and SF1, and repressed by DAX1 through abolishing the activation. Nerve growth factor-induced clone B (NGFIB) is also known as one of the transcription factors to bind to and activate 3?-HSD promoter. The results of our immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the expression levels of 3?-HSD in RSZ of IHA were higher than in RSZ of adjacent adrenals of APA, while those in the zona glomerulosa (ZG) of normal adrenal gland (NA) were in between these two RSZs. The expression levels of GATA6, SF1 and DAX1 did not prominently differ among these three types of adrenals, especially between in RSZs of IHA and APA cases, indicating the marked difference of 3?-HSD expression was unlikely to be explained by the levels of these three factors. However, the levels of NGFIB expression were significantly higher in RSZ of IHA than in RSZ of adjacent adrenals of APA and the ZG of NA (P<0.05), which may partly account for the expression levels of 3?-HSD among the three groups of adrenals. These results may imply NGFIB plays important roles in the marked differences in steroidogenic functions in the two distinct types of RSZ of PA cases.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531914","annotations":[{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.616385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.605076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.506351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.394889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Steroidogenesis","weight":0.376702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroidogenesis"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Hyperaldosteronism","weight":0.353107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperaldosteronism"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.186088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.168276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Primary aldosteronism","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_aldosteronism"},{"name":"Zona glomerulosa","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zona_glomerulosa"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"DAX","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX"},{"name":"Isomerase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomerase"},{"name":"DAX1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX1"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Imperial Household Agency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Household_Agency"},{"name":"Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardanger_Sunnhordlandske_Dampskipsselskap"},{"name":"Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxysteroid_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"GATA transcription factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATA_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Steroidogenic factor 1","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroidogenic_factor_1"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
