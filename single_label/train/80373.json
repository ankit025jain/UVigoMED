{"id":80373,"title":"Clinical phenotype of scabies by age.","abstract":"Scabies has a clinical presentation that seems to vary according to age. We conducted a prospective study with the goal of delineating the clinical presentation of the disease into 3 groups of age: infants, <2 years; children, 2 to 15 years; and adults, >15 years.This trial was a prospective, multicenter observational study in consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of scabies who were seen in 13 French Departments of Dermatology and Pediatric Dermatology between April 2010 and April 2011. A standardized questionnaire was completed for each patient. To identify factors associated with patient age, comparisons between the 3 age groups were conducted by using univariate and multivariate multinomial logistic regression analyses.A total of 323 individuals were included; the gender ratio (female:male) was 1.2:1. In univariate analysis, infants were more likely to have facial involvement. In multivariate logistic regression, relapse was more frequent in children (odds ratio [OR]: 2.45 [95% confidence interval (CI):1.23-4.88]) and infants (OR: 3.26 [95% CI: 1.38-7.71]). In addition, family members with itch (OR: 2.47 [95% CI: 1.04-5.89]), plantar (OR: 20.57 [95% CI: 7.22-58.60]), and scalp (OR: 16.94 [95% CI: 3.70-77.51]) involvement were also found to be independently associated with the age group <2 years.There is a specific clinical presentation of scabies in infants and children. Taking into account these specificities may be helpful for the early diagnosis and the identification of cases to prevent the propagation of the disease.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Parasitic
