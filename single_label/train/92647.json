{"id":92647,"title":"?(9)-THC modulation of fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) gene expression: possible involvement of induced levels of PPAR? in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.","abstract":"We recently reported that ?(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (?(9)-THC), a major cannabinoid component in Cannabis Sativa (marijuana), significantly stimulated the expression of fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) was previously implicated in this induction. However, the mechanisms mediating this induction have not been elucidated in detail. We performed a DNA microarray analysis of ?(9)-THC-treated samples and showed the selective up-regulation of the PPAR? isoform coupled with the induction of FA2H over the other isoforms (? and ?). ?(9)-THC itself had no binding/activation potential to/on PPAR?, and palmitic acid (PA), a PPAR? ligand, exhibited no stimulatory effects on FA2H in MDA-MB-231 cells; thus, we hypothesized that the levels of PPAR? induced were involved in the ?(9)-THC-mediated increase in FA2H. In support of this hypothesis, we herein demonstrated that; (i) ?(9)-THC activated the basal transcriptional activity of PPAR? in a concentration-dependent manner, (ii) the concomitant up-regulation of PPAR?/FA2H was caused by ?(9)-THC, (iii) PA could activate PPAR? after the PPAR? expression plasmid was introduced, and (iv) the ?(9)-THC-induced up-regulation of FA2H was further stimulated by the co-treatment with L-663,536 (a known PPAR? inducer). Taken together, these results support the concept that the induced levels of PPAR? may be involved in the ?(9)-THC up-regulation of FA2H in MDA-MB-231 cells.
