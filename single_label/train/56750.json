{"id":56750,"title":"Topical delivery of ocular therapeutics: carrier systems and physical methods.","abstract":"The basic concepts, major mechanisms, technological developments and advantages of the topical application of lipid-based systems (microemulsions, nanoemulsions, liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles), polymeric systems (hydrogels, contact lenses, polymeric nanoparticles and dendrimers) and physical methods (iontophoresis and sonophoresis) will be reviewed.Although very convenient for patients, topical administration of conventional drug formulations for the treatment of eye diseases requires high drug doses, frequent administration and rarely provides high drug bioavailability. Thus, strategies to improve the efficacy of topical treatments have been extensively investigated. In general, the majority of the successful delivery systems are present on the ocular surface over an extended period of time, and these systems typically improve drug bioavailability in the anterior chamber whereas the physical methods facilitate drug penetration over a very short period of time through ocular barriers, such as the cornea and sclera.Although in the early stages, the combination of these delivery systems with physical methods would appear to be a promising tool to decrease the dose and frequency of administration; thereby, patient compliance and treatment efficacy will be improved.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635555","annotations":[{"name":"Sclera","weight":0.880674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.761433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.704907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.686341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.622247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Iontophoresis","weight":0.566667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iontophoresis"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.560458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.45426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dendrimer","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrimer"},{"name":"Contact lens","weight":0.403169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.369063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.217447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Hydrogels","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogels"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.0245813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Microemulsion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microemulsion"}]}
