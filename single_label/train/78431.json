{"id":78431,"title":"[The role and clinical significance of 12-LOX passway in arachidonic acid metabolism induced by phospholipase Cgamma-2 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma].","abstract":"To explore the expression of phospholipase Cgamma-2 (PLCgamma-2), lipoxygenase-12 (12-LOX) and arachidonic acid (AA) in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and to study the the relationship between lipid metabolism and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.In 30 cases of carcinoma tissue and peritumoral laryngeal mucosa tissues (confirmed to be normal laryngeal tissues by pathology), immunohistochemical method (Streptavidin-peroxidase method, SP method) was used for the detection of expression of PLCgamma-2 and 12-LOX, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the content of the arachidonic acid in carcinoma tissue and peritumoral normal laryngeal mucosa tissues.The positive rates of PLCgamma-2 and 12-LOX in carcinoma tissue were higher than in peritumoral normal laryngeal mucosa tissues with statistically significance differences (P < 0.05). The content of arachidonic acid was lower in carcinoma tissue than in peritumoral normal laryngeal mucosa tissues with statistically significance difference (P < 0.05). The positive expressions of PLCgamma-2 and 12-LOX were closely correlated to tnm stage, histological differentiation and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). The content of arachidonic acid had no significant correlations with tnm stage, histological differentiation and lymph node metastasis (P > 0.05). Both the expression of PLCgamma-2 and 12-LOX and the content of arachidonic acid had no statistically significant correlation with age (P > 0.05).PLCgamma-2, AA and 12-LOX play important roles in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. It may be meaningful to the treatment of laryngeal carcinoma by suppressing this passway.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669684","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.830373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.694486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.694462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.494673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.493264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.493117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.395769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.33346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry","weight":0.127237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Lipoxygenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoxygenase"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
