{"id":77027,"title":"Metabolic syndrome and endothelin-1 mediated vasoconstrictor tone in overweight/obese adults.","abstract":"To determine whether endothelin (ET)-1 vasoconstrictor tone is greater in overweight and obese adults with the metabolic syndrome (MetS).Forty overweight/obese middle-aged and older adults (age: 43-71 years; BMI: 25.1-36.9 kg/mÂ²) were studied: 20 without MetS (13 M/7 F) and 20 with MetS (13 M/7 F). MetS was established according to NCEP ATP III guidelines. Forearm blood flow (FBF; plethysmography) responses to intra-arterial infusion of selective ET(A) receptor blockade (BQ-123; 100 nmol/min; for 60 min) and non-selective ET(A/B) receptor blockade (BQ-123 + BQ-788 [50 nmol/min for 60 min]) were determined.In response to the selective ET(A) antagonism, there was a significant increase in forearm blood flow from baseline in both groups. However, the increase in forearm blood flow was significantly higher (P=0.03; ~45%) in the overweight/obese group with MetS than the group without MetS. In contrast, there were no significant group differences in FBF responses to non-selective ET(A/B) receptor blockade. Peak vasodilator responses to nonselective ET(A/B) blockade were ~50% higher than baseline blood flow in the overweight/obese groups without and with MetS.MetS is associated with higher ET-1 vasoconstrictor tone in overweight/obese adults. The enhanced ET-1 vasoconstrictor activity with MetS is mediated by the ET(A) receptor subtype.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856242","annotations":[{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.880265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.628702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.587628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.405922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.355405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Endothelin","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Eta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta"},{"name":"ET1 (Greece)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ET1_(Greece)"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"788","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/788"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Glossary of Texas A&M University terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Texas_A&M_University_terms"},{"name":"National Cholesterol Education Program","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cholesterol_Education_Program"},{"name":"Plethysmograph","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plethysmograph"},{"name":"Blockade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"}]}
