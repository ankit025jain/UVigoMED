{"id":86489,"title":"Discoid lupus and pulmonary blastoma in an elderly patient.","abstract":"Discoid lupus is an autosomal disease that has not been found to predispose to cancer. Pulmonary blastoma is a rare primary lung tumor with a poor prognosis, which commonly presents at a younger age than non-small-cell lung carcinoma. We report a rare case of pulmonary blastoma in a 62-year-old man with discoid lupus who presented with chronic cough and pleuritic pain. The 5.3-cm tumor was located in the left upper lobe, invaded the visceral pleura, and adhered to the parietal pleura. The patient underwent a left upper lobectomy and chest wall excision, with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
