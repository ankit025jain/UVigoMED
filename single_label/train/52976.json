{"id":52976,"title":"Low positive predictive value of hemoglobin A1c for diagnosis of prediabetes in clinical practice.","abstract":"Positive predictive value (PPV) of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for diagnosis of prediabetes in clinical practice has not been well studied.In a prospective study, patients diagnosed with prediabetes based on HbA1c (5.7%-6.4%) underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as the gold standard test to diagnose dysglycemia. Demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidity, concomitant prescription medications and biochemical data were collected.We identified 66 patients with HbA1c-based prediabetes with a mean HbA1c of 6.00 ± 0.20%. However, based on the OGTT, 32 had normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 26 had prediabetes and 8 had diabetes yielding a PPV of HbA1c of 39.4%. In univariate analysis, the patients with the OGTT-based prediabetes administered more medications for associated medical problems compared with the NGT group (5.9 ± 2.2 versus 2.6 ± 1.8, P < 0.0001). After adjustment for baseline variables, the medication use remained significantly different between OGTT-based prediabetes and NGT groups (P = 0.041).PPV of HbA1c for diagnosis of prediabetes in clinical setting is low. Patients with HbA1c of 5.7% to 6.4% should undergo OGTT to confirm diagnosis of dysglycemia.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556928","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.911937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.72243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.699215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.674434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.611167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.580405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.574814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Hemoglobin A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_A"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Group 5 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_5_element"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
