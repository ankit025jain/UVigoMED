{"id":84276,"title":"Karyotype evolution in the horseshoe bat Rhinolophus sedulus by whole-arm reciprocal translocation (WART).","abstract":"Robertsonian (centric) fusion or fission is one of the predominant modes of chromosomal rearrangement in karyotype evolution among mammals. However, in karyotypes composed of only bi-armed chromosomes, creation of new chromosomal arm combinations in one step is possible only via whole-arm reciprocal translocation (WART). Although this type of rearrangement has often been proposed to play an important role in chromosomal evolution, direct observations of WARTs remained rare, and, in most cases, were found in hybrids of chromosomal races in the genera Mus and Sorex. For the first time, we present the karyotype of the horseshoe bat species Rhinolophus sedulus (2n = 28, FNa = 52), where a WART between 2 metacentric autosomes was detected by G-banding and confirmed by FISH with painting probes of the vespertilionid bat Myotis myotis. Among the 6 specimens analyzed, 2 showed the heterozygous condition of the WART, 1 showed the presumed ancestral, and 3 specimens showed the derived homozygous state. As the existence of a hybrid zone at the sampling locality is thought to be rather improbable, the WART may indicate ongoing karyotype evolution in this taxon.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139053","annotations":[{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Robertsonian translocation","weight":0.803965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertsonian_translocation"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Taxon","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon"},{"name":"Hybrid zone","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_zone"},{"name":"Heterozygous","weight":0.797641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygous"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.797641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Autosome","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"Fission (biology)","weight":0.633726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_(biology)"},{"name":"Ploidy","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy"},{"name":"Hybridization probe","weight":0.496493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybridization_probe"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.480405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Bat","weight":0.426713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Vesper bat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesper_bat"},{"name":"Horseshoe bat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_bat"},{"name":"Mouse-eared bat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse-eared_bat"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Greater mouse-eared bat","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_mouse-eared_bat"},{"name":"Horseshoe","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe"}]}
