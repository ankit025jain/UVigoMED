{"id":66412,"title":"High CXC chemokine receptor 4 expression is an adverse prognostic factor in patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Aberrant CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expressions in malignant tissues have been reported; however, its role in kidney cancer prognosis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of CXCR4 expression in patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).The study included 225 patients with ccRCC. The cohort was split into a training set (n=125) and a validation set (n=100). CXC chemokine receptor 4 expression was analysed by immunohistochemical staining and its correlations with clinicopathologic features and prognosis were evaluated.CXCR4-staining intensity increased gradually accompanied with disease progression from TNM stages I to IV in 225 patients with ccRCC. Moreover, high CXCR4 expression indicated reduced overall survival (OS) in the training (P<0.001) and validation (P<0.001) sets, especially for patients with early-stage (TNM stage I+II) diseases. Furthermore, CXCR4 expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor for OS, and combining TNM stage with CXCR4 expression showed a better prognostic value for OS in both sets.High CXCR4 expression, an independent adverse prognostic factor, could be combined with TNM stage to generate a predictive nomogram for clinical outcome in patients with ccRCC.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714746","annotations":[{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.808784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.762319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.74432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.670374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.524517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Nomogram","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.3225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.163499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"CXCR4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCR4"},{"name":"Chemokine receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine_receptor"},{"name":"Training set","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set"}]}
