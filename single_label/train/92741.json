{"id":92741,"title":"Quality of life and anxiety of patients affected by the PIP/Rofil Medical breast implant recall: results from a prospective monocentre cohort study.","abstract":"The PIP/Rofil Medical breast implant recall affected around 40,000 women worldwide. An impact on quality of life (QoL) has been suspected but not yet reported.To quantify QoL and anxiety in affected women with respect to implant indication and their removal.Women who attended consultation and opted for implant removal between December 2011 and 2012 were eligible for study. Quality of life and anxiety were measured using validated questionnaires pre- and postoperatively.Fifty-five patients completed at least one questionnaire, of which 32 had received implants for breast cancer, 15 for aesthetic augmentation, and 8 for primary breast malformations. Removal of the implants improved QoL in every group, especially those who had malformations. The QoL of breast cancer patients was generally better compared to the patients with implant for other reasons.The recall of PIP/Rofil Medical breast implants had a measurable impact on QoL in affected women and no pathological worry was measurable among those women.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24966121","annotations":[{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.688496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.559022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.474518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.361179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.361053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.276157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Product recall","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_recall"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
