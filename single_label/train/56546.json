{"id":56546,"title":"Electroretinograms and level of aqueous vascular endothelial growth factor in eyes with hemicentral retinal vein occlusion or branch retinal vein occlusion.","abstract":"Hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (hCRVO) is a disease related to CRVO but not to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). We reported a significant correlation between aqueous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and the implicit time of 30-Hz flicker electroretinogram (ERG) in CRVO eyes. The purpose of this study was to compare aqueous VEGF levels and ERG components between hCRVO and BRVO eyes.The medical records of patients with macular edema secondary to hCRVO (12 eyes) or BRVO (16 eyes) and received an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (IVB) at the Nagoya University Hospital from July 2009 to May 2013 were reviewed. Full-field ERGs were recorded before the IVB. Aqueous humor was collected just before the IVB to measure VEGF concentration. Differences in aqueous VEGF level and ERG components between hCRVO and BRVO eyes were determined.Mean aqueous VEGF concentration in hCRVO eyes was significantly higher than that in BRVO eyes (504 vs. 148 pg/ml, P < 0.05). The implicit time of 30-Hz flicker ERG was significantly longer in hCRVO than in BRVO eyes (33.5 vs. 29.8 ms, P < 0.01).The significant difference in VEGF levels in aqueous and implicit times of 30-Hz flicker ERG suggest that retinal ischemia is more manifest in hCRVO than in BRVO eyes.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668132","annotations":[{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.714156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.608277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Macular edema","weight":0.599837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Electroretinography","weight":0.472756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroretinography"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.394432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.392511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Aqueous humour","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.223833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.193233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Nagoya","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya"},{"name":"Nagoya University","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya_University"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Humour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Flicker (screen)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_(screen)"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Central retinal vein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"Central retinal vein occlusion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_retinal_vein_occlusion"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"}]}
