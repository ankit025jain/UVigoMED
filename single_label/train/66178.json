{"id":66178,"title":"microRNA?145 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting matrix metallopeptidase-11 in renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"microRNA?145 (miR?145) has been reported to be frequently downregulated in various types of cancer, including renal, prostate, bladder, lung and colon cancer, as well as B?cell malignancies. The present study examined the effects of miR?145 on the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Following transfection of miR?145, an MTT, cell migration, cell invasion and luciferase assays, and western blot analysis were conducted in RCC cell lines. The present study demonstrated that miR?145 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in 786?O and A498 cells. The present study also demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that miR?145 may directly target matrix metallopeptidase?11 (MMP?11) in RCC. miR?145 was demonstrated to suppress cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting MMP?11 in RCC cell lines. These results suggested that it may be investigated as a predictive marker for the early detection of tumor metastasis and for targeting therapeutic drugs to inhibit the invasion of RCC.
