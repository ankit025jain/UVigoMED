{"id":72648,"title":"Giant-cell tumor of the patella in a skeletally immature girl.","abstract":"We reported on a case of a giant-cell tumor of the patella which occurred in a skeletally immature patient. This combination of unusual age of presentation and atypical location made our case clinically and radiologically unique.A 13-year-old girl presented with complains of knee pain and swelling. After radiological investigations and percutaneous needle biopsy a diagnosis of giant-cell tumor of the patella was made, for which the patient underwent patellectomy with en bloc resection of the lesion and the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination.It was concluded that early diagnosis may be difficult in such cases and hence, GCT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a destructive lesion of the patella, regardless of the age of presentation.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953972","annotations":[{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.717004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.699309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.224085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.13935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Monobloc engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monobloc_engine"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 13","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_13"},{"name":"Government College of Technology, Coimbatore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_College_of_Technology,_Coimbatore"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
