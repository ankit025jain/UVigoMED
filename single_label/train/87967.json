{"id":87967,"title":"Dynamics of the increase in strength and girth of quadriceps muscle after the reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament.","abstract":"Reconstruction is the method of choice in the treatment of ACL rupture. Postoperative rehabilitation is a very important aspect of therapeutic management. One of priority elements is to regain proper strength and function of the quadriceps muscle in a short time. The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the increase in strength and girth of quadriceps after ACL reconstruction.The examined group consisted of 30 patients who had undergone arthroscopic assisted quadruple bundle dual channel ACL reconstruction surgery in years 2010-2011. The average age of the patients at the time of operation was 31.7 years (range 17-53). Each patient was examined 4 times: before the surgery as well as in the second, sixth and twelfth week after the reconstruction.Examination revealed a significant increase in quadriceps girth, with peak increase rate observed within the two first weeks after the surgery. Between weeks 2 and 6, a decrease in quadriceps girth was observed followed by repeated increase worm week 6 on. The greatest increase in the girth at the thickest point of the muscle was observed in rehabilitation weeks 6 through 12. A significant decrease in muscle strength was observed in the first 2 weeks after the surgery. In the remaining periods, the strength of the quadriceps muscle continued to grow. The average KSS score increased from 109.1 at week 2 to 162.3 at week 12 after the surgery.Rehabilitation results in a dynamic increase in the strength of quadriceps between weeks 6 and 12 following reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament. However, the 12-week rehabilitation period is not sufficient to regain full functionality.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24940795","annotations":[{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.902221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.761904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Quadriceps femoris muscle","weight":0.723902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.715417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.52868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.232822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","weight":0.216262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_reconstruction"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.116614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"1753","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1753"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Sprain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprain"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Quadruple","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple"},{"name":"Dual-channel architecture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-channel_architecture"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Tag_Team_Champions_(WWE)"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"}]}
