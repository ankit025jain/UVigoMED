{"id":81933,"title":"Prevention of osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with bone metastases treated with bisphosphonates.","abstract":"Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and are widely used in the treatment of bone metastases. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is the worst side-effect related to BP use. At our Center, we have implemented internal guidelines regarding the management of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. Our analysis includes 200 patients affected by solid tumors with bone metastases who received zoledronic acid. They underwent a baseline mouth assessment to evaluate their dental conditions and to perform dental care; a dental follow-up was performed every six months. All patients received calcium and vitamin D daily. Dental examination and application of preventive measures led to a total reduction in ONJ in our patients treated with zoledronic acid. The keystone in management of ONJ is prevention, and the risk of developing ONJ during treatment with zoledronic acid is reduced by implementing preventive measures.
