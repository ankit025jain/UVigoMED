{"id":82170,"title":"Use of local anesthesia during dental rehabilitation with general anesthesia: a survey of dentist anesthesiologists.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to document current practices of dentist anesthesiologists who are members of the American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists regarding the supplemental use of local anesthesia for children undergoing dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia. A survey was administered via e-mail to the membership of the American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists to document the use of local anesthetic during dental rehabilitations under general anesthesia and the rationale for its use. Seventy-seven (42.1%) of the 183 members responded to this survey. The majority of dentist anesthesiologists prefer use of local anesthetic during general anesthesia for dental rehabilitation almost always or sometimes (90%, 63/70) and 40% (28/70) prefer its use with rare exception. For dentist anesthesiologists who prefer the administration of local anesthesia almost always, they listed the following factors as very important: \"stabilization of vital signs/decreased depth of general anesthesia\" (92.9%, 26/28) and \"improved patient recovery\" (82.1%, 23/28). There was a significant association between the type of practice and who determines whether or not local anesthesia is administered during cases. The majority of respondents favor the use of local anesthesia during dental rehabilitation under general anesthesia.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697820","annotations":[{"name":"Local anesthetic","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic"},{"name":"Local anesthesia","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthesia"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.800536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Anesthesiologist","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.382248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Listed building","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Email","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"},{"name":"Rehabilitation (Soviet)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(Soviet)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"92.9 (Perth radio station)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/92.9_(Perth_radio_station)"}]}
