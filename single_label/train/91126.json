{"id":91126,"title":"Long-term functional outcomes (median 10 years) after locked plating for displaced fractures of the proximal humerus.","abstract":"Locked plating has become an accepted treatment for displaced fractures of the proximal humerus. However, to our knowledge, long-term outcomes have not been reported.Between February 2002 and March 2004, 121 patients with displaced proximal humeral fractures were treated by open reduction and locking plate fixation. Forty-three patients were available for 10-year (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.8-10.1) follow-up, including Constant score (CS), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score, and Short Form 36 questionnaire.Of 43 patients (72% women; mean age at time of fracture repair, 58.2 years; 95% CI, 54.2-62.2), the absolute CS 10 years after surgery was 75.3 (95% CI, 69.2-81.4). The normalized CS was 88.4 (95% CI, 81.7-95.1), and the CS in percentage to the contralateral side (%CS) was 83.7 (95% CI, 78.5-88.9). In contrast, at 1 year, the CS was 73.9 (95% CI, 67.8-80.2, P = .774), the normalized CS was 87.2 (95% CI, 80.4-94.0; P = .765), and the %CS was 78.7 (95% CI, 71.5-85.8; P = .355). The CS at 10 years correlated with the CS at 1 year after surgery (r = 0.460; P < .01) and with patient gender (r = -0.424; P < .01), and it strongly correlated with patient age (r = -0.545; P < .001).Ten years after locked plating of displaced proximal humeral fractures, patients show good to excellent outcomes in the majority of cases with no relevant decline compared with the shoulder function 1 year after surgery. However, poor long-term outcome is seen in 16% of patients and relates to a low CS 1 year after surgery. Thus, patients developing poor long-term outcomes may be identified at an earlier stage.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548438","annotations":[{"name":"Gender","weight":0.437007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.334151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.212215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.061322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Absolute value","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value"},{"name":"Computer science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"795","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/795"},{"name":"774","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/774"},{"name":"810","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/810"},{"name":"765","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/765"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"585","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/585"},{"name":"355","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/355"},{"name":"880","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/880"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Strongly correlated material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
