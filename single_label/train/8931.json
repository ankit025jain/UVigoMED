{"id":8931,"title":"Cardioprotective activity of placental growth factor in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction: nanoparticle-based delivery versus direct myocardial injection.","abstract":"To comparatively evaluate the cardioprotective activity of placental growth factor (PGF) delivered through direct injection and a nanoparticle-based system respectively and to study the underlying mechanisms in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-based PGF-carrying nanoparticles (PGF-PLGANPs) were created. The mean size and morphology of particles were analyzed with particle size analyzer and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). Encapsulation efficiency and sustained-release dose curve were analyzed by ELISA. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups (n?=?10). While animals in the first group were left untreated as controls, those in the other 3 groups underwent surgical induction of AMI, followed by treatment with physiological saline, PGF, and PGF-PLGANPs, respectively. Cardiac function was evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography at 4 weeks after treatment. At 6 weeks, rats were sacrificed, infarction size was analyzed with Masson trichrome staining, and protein contents of TIMP-2, MT1-MMP and MMP-2 at the infarction border were determined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis.PGF was released for at least 15 days, showing successful preparation of PGF-PLGANPs. Coronary artery ligation successfully induced AMI. Compared to physiological saline control, PGF, injected to the myocardium either as a nude molecule or in a form of nanoparticles, significantly reduced infarction size, improved cardiac function, and elevated myocardial expression of TIMP-2, MT1-MMP, and MMP-2 (P?<?0.05). The effect of PGF-PLGANPs was more pronounced than that of non-encapsulated PGF (P?<?0.05).Target PGF delivery to myocardium may improve cardiac function after AMI in rats. PLGA-based nanoparticles appear to be a better approach to delivery PGF. PGF exerts its cardioprotective effect at least partially through regulating metalloproteinase-mediated myocardial tissue remodeling.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Animal
