{"id":8995,"title":"Anti-asthmatic activities of an ethanol extract of Aster yomena in an ovalbumin-induced murine asthma model.","abstract":"Aster yomena is used in traditional remedies to treat cough, asthma and insect bites; however, its therapeutic mechanism is not completely understood. To elucidate the anti-asthmatic effect of A. yomena, we investigated the anti-asthmatic characteristics of an alcohol extract of A. yomena in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine asthma model. In this study, we showed that A. yomena extract inhibited the overall pathophysiological features of asthma by suppressing Th2 responses and enzymes associated with the production of inflammatory mediators. This suppression resulted in decreased Th2 type cytokines and eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and OVA-specific IgE in serum. Additionally, A. yomena extract significantly decreased airway hyperresponsiveness and abrogated the histopathological changes in the lungs, which reached normal levels in the OVA-challenged mice treated with A. yomena extract. These findings suggest that A. yomena could be a promising natural agent for treating bronchial asthma in humans.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738663","annotations":[{"name":"Insect","weight":0.901324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.854513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.723532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Traditional medicine","weight":0.607899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.470961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Ovalbumin","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovalbumin"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.33773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.303767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Bronchoalveolar lavage","weight":0.20207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoalveolar_lavage"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0471911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Inflammatory mediators","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_mediators"},{"name":"Bite","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Insect bites and stings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_bites_and_stings"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
