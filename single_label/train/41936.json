{"id":41936,"title":"Combination of blood tests for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis improves the assessment of liver-prognosis in chronic hepatitis C.","abstract":"Recent longitudinal studies have emphasised the prognostic value of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis and cross-sectional studies have shown their combination significantly improves diagnostic accuracy.To compare the prognostic accuracy of six blood fibrosis tests and liver biopsy, and evaluate if test combination improves the liver-prognosis assessment in chronic hepatitis C (CHC).A total of 373 patients with compensated CHC, liver biopsy (Metavir F) and blood tests targeting fibrosis (APRI, FIB4, Fibrotest, Hepascore, FibroMeter) or cirrhosis (CirrhoMeter) were included. Significant liver-related events (SLRE) and liver-related deaths were recorded during follow-up (started the day of biopsy).During the median follow-up of 9.5 years (3508 person-years), 47 patients had a SLRE and 23 patients died from liver-related causes. For the prediction of first SLRE, most blood tests allowed higher prognostication than Metavir F [Harrell C-index: 0.811 (95% CI: 0.751-0.868)] with a significant increase for FIB4: 0.879 [0.832-0.919] (P = 0.002), FibroMeter: 0.870 [0.812-0.922] (P = 0.005) and APRI: 0.861 [0.813-0.902] (P = 0.039). Multivariate analysis identified FibroMeter, CirrhoMeter and sustained viral response as independent predictors of first SLRE. CirrhoMeter was the only independent predictor of liver-related death. The combination of FibroMeter and CirrhoMeter classifications into a new FM/CM classification improved the liver-prognosis assessment compared to Metavir F staging or single tests by identifying five subgroups of patients with significantly different prognoses.Some blood fibrosis tests are more accurate than liver biopsy for determining liver prognosis in CHC. A new combination of two complementary blood tests, one targeted for fibrosis and the other for cirrhosis, optimises assessment of liver-prognosis.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24889599","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.732907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.583167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.557171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.299254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.224504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Divination","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination"},{"name":"Combination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"811","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/811"},{"name":"861","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/861"},{"name":"868","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868"},{"name":"870","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/870"},{"name":"879","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/879"},{"name":"922","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/922"},{"name":"919","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/919"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Area code 902","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_902"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Combinatio nova","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatio_nova"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
