{"id":30186,"title":"Classics in chemical neuroscience: diazepam (valium).","abstract":"Diazepam (Valium) is among the most successful drugs from the onset of the psychopharmacological revolution that began during the 1950s. Efficacious in treating a wide-spectrum of CNS disorders, including anxiety and epilepsy, it set the standard for pharmacotherapy in terms of potency, onset of action, and safety. In this Review, the legacy of diazepam to chemical neuroscience will be considered along with its synthesis, pharmacology, drug metabolism, adverse events and dependence, clinical use, and regulatory issues.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24552479","annotations":[{"name":"Diazepam","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Neuroscience","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Drug metabolism","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Psychopharmacology","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopharmacology"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.625218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.551285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.540779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.36082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"1950s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Onset of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onset_of_action"},{"name":"Biomedical engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering"},{"name":"Classics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics"},{"name":"Revolution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
