{"id":90025,"title":"Metastatic spinal cord compression: a validated survival score for elderly patients.","abstract":"This study aimed to develop a validated survival score for elderly patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC).In all, 1,128 patients were randomly assigned to the test (n?=?564) or validation group (n = 564). In the test group, ten pretreatment factors (age, gender, performance status, primary tumor, number of involved vertebrae, ambulatory status, other bone metastases, visceral metastases, interval from cancer diagnosis to radiotherapy of MSCC, time to developing motor deficits) plus the radiation regimen were retrospectively evaluated. Factors significantly associated with survival on multivariate analysis were included in the survival score. The score for each factor was determined by dividing the 6-month survival rate (%) by 10. The prognostic score represented the sum of the scores for each factor.In the multivariate analysis of the test group, age, performance status, primary tumor type, ambulatory status, other bone metastases, visceral metastases, interval from cancer diagnosis to radiotherapy of MSCC, and time to developing motor deficits were significantly associated with survival. Total scores ranged from 25 to 57 points. In the test group, 6-month survival rates were 11?% for 25-39 points, 56?% for 40-48 points, and 97?% for 49-57 points (p?<?0.001). In the validation group, 6-month survival rates were 10, 53, and 94?%, respectively (p?<?0.001).Based on the survival scores of the test group, three prognostic groups were identified. The survival rates of the validation group were similar to the test group. This score appears reproducible and can help select the appropriate treatment for elderly patients with MSCC.","date":"2014-10-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658606","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.748916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Spinal cord compression","weight":0.570919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_compression"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.56606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Bone metastasis","weight":0.565808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_metastasis"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.523057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.403081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.27754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Performance art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Districts of Mongolia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Mongolia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Ambulatory","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"}]}
