{"id":83131,"title":"[Clinical research on curative effect of complete denture with two kinds of occlusion for temporomandibular joint disorders of aged edentulous patients].","abstract":"To compare curative effect between complete denture with lingualized occlusion and anatomic occlusion on temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) of aged edentulous patients with severe residual alveolar ridge resorption.Seventy aged edentulous patients with severe residual alveolar ridge resorption were recruited in this study and randomly assigned into two groups, thirty-five each. In Group A, patients received complete denture with lingualized occlusion, and in Group B, patients received complete denture with anatomic occlusion. The condition of TMD was examined and recorded by the same TMD specialist at baseline, 3 months and 6 months following denture delivery. The recovery effect of TMD was evaluated according to Fricton Index. Related data were analyzed statistically with t-test and rank sum test.Three months following denture delivery, the craniomandibular index (CMI) decrease value was (0.064 ± 0.022) in group A, and was significantly higher than that in group B (0.043 ± 0.018) (P < 0.01). Six months following denture delivery, the CMI decrease value was (0.084 ± 0.020) in group A, and was significantly higher than that in group B (0.070 ± 0.021) (P = 0.011<0.05).Complete denture with lingualized occlusion may be more conducive to the remission of TMD for aged edentulous patients with severe residual alveolar ridge resorption.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438569","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.468345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.33402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint disorder","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.133635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0602196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Dental alveolus","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_alveolus"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Edentulism","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edentulism"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.0176659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Ridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Related","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Related"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"Districts of Mongolia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Mongolia"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"0110","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0110"},{"name":"Occlusion (dentistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion_(dentistry)"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
