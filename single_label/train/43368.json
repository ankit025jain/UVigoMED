{"id":43368,"title":"Neutropenic enterocolitis affecting the transverse colon: an unusual complication of chemotherapy.","abstract":"A 66-year-old woman presented with a 1-day history of sudden onset of generalised abdominal pain associated with fever and vomiting. She was previously diagnosed with left breast cancer 2 months ago and completed a course of chemotherapy 1 week prior to presentation. She was clinically unwell with generalised tenderness in her abdomen. Blood investigations showed severe neutropenia. A CT scan was requested which reported a marked oedematous swelling of the transverse colon with features suggestive of a contained perforation. The decision was made to operate. Intraoperatively, the transverse colon was found to be thickened with omentum adherent focally around the distal third. A right hemicolectomy was performed with an end ileostomy and mucus fistula. The patient made a successful recovery and was discharged within 7 days of presenting. Pathology reported typical features of neutropenic enterocolitis affecting the transverse colon with a normal terminal ileum, caecum and ascending colon.
