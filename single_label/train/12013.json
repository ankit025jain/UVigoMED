{"id":12013,"title":"Inhibition of IFN-? promotes anti-asthma effect of Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin neonatal vaccination: a murine asthma model.","abstract":"The Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) neonatal vaccination inhibits allergy-induced pathologic changes. However, the mechanisms underlying this process are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of interferon (IFN)-? and interleukin (IL)-17 in the protective effects of the BCG neonatal vaccination on allergic pulmonary inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR).Wild type (WT)-neonate and IL-17 knock out (KO) neonate mice were vaccinated with BCG. A murine asthma model was developed by sensitization and then challenging with ovalbumin (OVA). Recombinant IL-17 or recombinant IFN-? was delivered to the airway to overexpress IL-17 or IFN-?. An anti-IFN-? neutralizing antibody was used to block the effects of IFN-?.We found exogenous IL-17 delivered to the airway reversed the anti-asthma effects of the neonatal BCG vaccination. BCG neonatal vaccination further reduced OVA-induced inflammation and AHR in IL-17 KO mice. Inhibition of IFN-? in BCG neonatal vaccinated OVA-induced asthma model mice led to a further reduction in airway inflammation and AHR. In addition, airway inflammation and AHR were robust following treatment with exogenous IFN-?. Neutralizing IL-17 was not sufficient to block OVA-induced airway inflammation and AHR. In IL-17 KO mice, airway inflammation and AHR did not occur following treatment with an anti-IFN-? neutralizing antibody.In an OVA-induced murine asthma model, inhibition of IFN-? enhanced the anti-asthma effects of BCG neonatal vaccination.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560675","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.779394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.686011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Ovalbumin","weight":0.535321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovalbumin"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.524244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.505531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.443368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.412673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.358563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.343787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.15896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Bacillus","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus"},{"name":"Neutralizing antibody","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutralizing_antibody"},{"name":"Mycobacterium bovis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_bovis"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Recurrent airway obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Sensitization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization"}]}
