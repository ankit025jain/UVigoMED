{"id":4739,"title":"Dental caries among children in Georgia by age, gender, residence location and ethnic group.","abstract":"To provide prevalence data for dental caries in Georgia.This World Health Organization pathfinder survey was conducted among 1,351 (6, 12 and 15 year-old) Georgian children, representing the main ethnic groups in urban and rural locations. Caries was analysed at univariate and multivariate levels, according to age, gender, urban/rural locality and ethnic group.Caries experience levels among 6-year-olds were dmft = 4.57, sd 3.42 (14.8% caries-free); DMFT = 2.04 (sd 2.02) among 12-year-olds (31.1% caries-free); and DMFT = 3.51 (sd 3.14) for the 15-year-olds (17.7% caries-free). Urban children at ages 6 and 12 years were more likely to be caries-free and have both lower levels of caries-experience and higher levels of filled or restored teeth. In multivariate regression analyses, most age groups showed a significant contribution from residence location. No differences were found by age and no consistent differences were detected by ethnic group.These data should provide the baseline for formulating and conducting public oral health efforts in Georgia, with emphases on rural residence locations.","date":"2014-10-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300151","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.72491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.61009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.597669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.590235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.366486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.322332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.252943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.151377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.145792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Georgia (country)","weight":0.0389337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Conducting","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"351","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/351"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Experience point","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point"},{"name":"Urban areas in Sweden","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Windows NT 3.51","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.51"},{"name":"The New Era","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Era"}]}
