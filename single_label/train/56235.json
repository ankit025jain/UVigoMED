{"id":56235,"title":"Relation between changes in foveal choroidal thickness and 1-year results of ranibizumab therapy for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.","abstract":"To determine a correlation between changes in the subfoveal choroidal thickness and outcomes 1?year after ranibizumab therapy for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV).We prospectively studied 89 consecutive eyes with treatment-naïve symptomatic PCV and 1?year of follow-up after treatment. The choroidal thickness was measured monthly by optical coherence tomography using enhanced-depth imaging and the correlation between the changes in the choroidal thickness and outcomes 1?year after treatment was analysed.86 eyes followed for 1?year were ultimately analysed. The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity (0.33±0.35) 1?year after the first injection significantly (p=0.001) improved compared to baseline (0.42±0.37). The mean choroidal and foveal retinal thicknesses decreased significantly (p=0.001 for both comparisons) from 271 and 347??m to 212 and 203??m, respectively. The amplitude of the change in the subfoveal choroidal thickness during the 1-year follow-up in eyes in which the polypoidal lesions resolved 1?year after the first injection (89±94??m) was significantly (p=0.022) greater than in eyes in which the polypoidal lesions remained (45±109??m).The subfoveal choroidal thickness decreased during ranibizumab therapy, which was associated with resolved polypoidal lesions and foveal retinal thickness, and may be associated with PCV activity.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24723615","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.614349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.590766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.584655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.478724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.19543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.18939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.16256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"}]}
