{"id":28852,"title":"Amphetamines in wastewater of the city Pozna? (Poland)--estimation of drug abuse.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to determine the profile of amphetamines consumed by a community in Poland. Amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA (ecstasy) were detected in wastewater samples collected from the main Wastewater Treatment Plant in the city of Pozna? (about 687 000 people) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Back-calculations used in the sewage epidemiology approach were applied to estimate the level of consumption of the drugs being analyzed. These types of studies were carried out for the first time in Poland for a considerable period--from June 2009 to December 2010. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed significant monthly differences in amphetamine consumption. The concentration of amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA in wastewater samples and the levels of their consumption were lower than reported in other European countries, but unexpectedly, the ratio of consumed methamphetamine to MDMA and the consumption level of methamphetamine were relatively high. This study shows that sewage epidemiology is a promising tool, especially when combined with classical methods, to estimate illicit drugs use in a particular population. Therefore, efforts should be made to monitor the profiles and consumption levels of drugs and to extend the scope of the research to other illicit substances, especially cannabinoids and cocaine.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779191","annotations":[{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"MDMA","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA"},{"name":"Substituted amphetamine","weight":0.855262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.786344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Illegal drug trade","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.709043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.60319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Poland","weight":0.315669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.189562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0968837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Mass (liturgy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"}]}
