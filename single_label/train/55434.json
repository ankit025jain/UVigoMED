{"id":55434,"title":"Enhancement of femtosecond lenticule extraction for visual symptomatic eye after myopia correction.","abstract":"The novel Femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx) procedure has been considered safe, predictable, and effective in treating myopia and myopic astigmatism, with few complications. However, an enhancement procedure after FLEx may be required in some cases, but has not been reported in detail.A 24-year-old woman who had undergone bilateral FLEx with the VisuMax femtosecond laser treatment for myopic astigmatism complained of double vision in her left eye after the operation. The manifest refraction was -0.50/-1.25 × 180°. The corneal topography showed a central-inferior steepened zone. The ocular wavefront measurements displayed a high value of total aberrations as well as coma. She was scheduled for an enhancement procedure and it was performed by relifting the primary FLEx flap in the left eye four months later. Ablation was made with the Mel-80 excimer laser. After retreatment, the corresponding aberrations were diminished and the corneal topography turned flattened. Her symptom resolved completely with good visual outcomes.This first detailed case report demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of enhancement after FLEx for visual symptomatic eye after myopia correction. An analysis of more cases would be necessary to determine a more definite profile.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884873","annotations":[{"name":"Excimer laser","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.866179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.859481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Diplopia","weight":0.782831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.777672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Corneal topography","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_topography"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.755108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Wavefront","weight":0.753378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront"},{"name":"Optical aberration","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.671842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.519774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.40451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0775986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laser surgery","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_surgery"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Excimer","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 24","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_24"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
