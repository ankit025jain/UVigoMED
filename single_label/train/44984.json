{"id":44984,"title":"Umbilical metastasis derived from early stage rectal cancer: a case report.","abstract":"Umbilical metastasis, also called Sister Mary Joseph's nodule (SMJN), is defined as the umbilical nodule associated with advanced metastatic intra-abdominal and pelvic malignancies. A patient with umbilical metastasis has been deemed to have a poor prognosis. Rectal cancer presenting with a SMJN is a rare phenomenon, especially in the early stage and in middle-low rectal cancer.We report a case of a 70-year-old male presenting with umbilical metastasis derived from rectal cancer (10 cm from the anal verge, T2N0).For rectal cancer with umbilical metastasis, the exact metastatic routes as well as the criterion of diagnosis and treatments are not very clear. Here we review the literature on rectal cancer and SMJN to deepen the understanding of this disease.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708697","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.814495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.50602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.319308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Diploid","weight":0.239878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.188228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0438266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Martin BM","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_BM"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Mary (mother of Jesus)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Sister Mary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Mary"},{"name":"Nun","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0124579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
