{"id":91923,"title":"Pre-activation and muscle activity during frontal impact in relation to whiplash associated disorders.","abstract":"For the evaluation of neck injury the relative distance was observed between a marker placed on the forehead and a marker placed on the shoulder and also by change of the angle. To compare the severity of head injury a value of maximum head acceleration was used, HIC and a 3 ms criterion. All criteria were related to the activity of musculus sternocleidomastoideus and musculus trapezius in a situation of expected or unexpected impact.The situation was recorded using a Qualisys system, head acceleration of probands in three axes was recorded using the accelerometer, activity of neck muscles was monitored by a mobile EMG.Maximum head acceleration was 12.1?g for non-visual and 8.2?g for visual. HIC36 was 5.7 non visual and 4.0 for visual. 3-ms criterion was 11.5?g for non-visual and 7.8?g for visual. The average time of muscle activation of the observed group without visual perception is 0.027?s after hitting an obstacle, with visual perception 0.127?s before the crash.Kinematic values indicate more favourable parameters for neck injuries for visual. Head injury criteria show an average decrease of about 30% for visual. We can conclude that the visual perception means a significant increase in pre-activation of the observed muscle group of almost 400% and lower activation in both following phases of approximately 40%.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464011","annotations":[{"name":"Accelerometer","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.788683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.634161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Whiplash (medicine)","weight":0.553958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_(medicine)"},{"name":"Forehead","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehead"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.460654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Sternocleidomastoid muscle","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternocleidomastoid_muscle"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.370578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.243374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.23286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Kinematics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Trapezius muscle","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezius_muscle"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"G-force","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Proband","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proband"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Neck pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_pain"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"}]}
