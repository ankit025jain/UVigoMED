{"id":90582,"title":"Risk factors for closed-head injuries during military airborne operations.","abstract":"One of the more serious adverse outcomes of military airborne operations is closed-head injuries. This investigation examined risk factors for closed-head injuries in an Army airborne infantry unit.Closed-head injuries were defined as energy exchanges in which the head contacted the ground or an object and the soldier sought medical care for external trauma, headache, loss of consciousness, or altered mental state. Injury data were obtained by investigators in the drop zone and diagnoses were confirmed by a physician. Operational data on potential injury risk factors were obtained from routine reports published by the infantry unit. Weather data were obtained using a pocket weather tracker.There were 96,132 jumps resulting in 310 closed-head injuries for a crude incidence of 3.22/1000 jumps. In 98% of known cases the injury was associated with parachute landings. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that independent risk factors for closed-head injuries included night jumps, combat loads, higher wind speeds, higher temperatures, enlisted rank, and entanglements.This study identifies the current incidence and extrinsic risk factors for closed-head injuries during military airborne operations. Although it is necessary to conduct airborne training under realistic conditions, trainers and commanders should be aware of these risks and plan airborne operations accordingly.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597153","annotations":[{"name":"Military","weight":0.715908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.650353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.545987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.524345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Infantry","weight":0.44587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.445284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.434161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.425721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.405455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Parachute","weight":0.351487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.287322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Weather","weight":0.190881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather"},{"name":"Unconsciousness","weight":0.133996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness"},{"name":"United States Army","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"},{"name":"Enlisted rank","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.114857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Wind","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind"},{"name":"Altered state of consciousness","weight":0.0381889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_state_of_consciousness"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Airborne forces","weight":0.0293966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_forces"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Military rank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_rank"},{"name":"Wind speed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed"},{"name":"Amphibious warfare","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_warfare"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Trade","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"},{"name":"Military unit","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_unit"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Philosophical realism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism"}]}
