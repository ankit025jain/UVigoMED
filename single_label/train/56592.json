{"id":56592,"title":"Microglia-Müller cell interactions in the retina.","abstract":"Microglia and Müller cells are cell types that feature prominently in responses to disease and injury in the retina. However, their mutual interactions have not been investigated in detail. Here, we review evidence that indicate that these two cell populations exchange functionally significant signals under uninjured conditions and during retinal inflammation. Under normal conditions, Müller cells constitute a potential source of extracellular ATP that mediates the activity-dependent regulation of microglial dynamic process motility. Following microglial activation in inflammation, microglia can signal to Müller cells, influencing their morphological, molecular, and functional responses. Microglia-Müller cell interactions appear to be a mode of bi-directional communications that help shape the overall injury response in the retina.
