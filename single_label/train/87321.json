{"id":87321,"title":"[Forensic medical expertise of the injurious exposure].","abstract":"The objective of the present study was to develop the standardized approach to the evaluation of the character of injurious exposure with a view to objective interpretation of the conditions of injury formation and the properties of the traumatic agent. The main attention was given to such parameters of the injurious exposure as loading conditions (mass, speed, direction) and the surface properties of the traumatic agent (area, shape, hardness). It is expected that the use of the proposed system for the evaluation of the injurious exposure in the practical work of forensic medical experts will enhance the reliability of their conclusions and help to avoid mistakes.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25269168","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.722715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.281649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Medical jurisprudence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_jurisprudence"},{"name":"Standardized approach (operational risk)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_approach_(operational_risk)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Hardness","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness"}]}
