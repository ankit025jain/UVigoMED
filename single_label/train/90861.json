{"id":90861,"title":"Role of ultrasonography with color-Doppler in the emergency diagnosis of acute penile fracture: a case report.","abstract":"Penile fracture is the rupture of tunica albuginea, typically resulting from blunt trauma, intercourse, or penile manipulation. Diagnosis is made clinically. Ultrasound is not used frequently in diagnosis of penile fracture but it provides a fast, non-invasive alternative to more often used MRI and cavernography. We aimed to present diagnostic ultrasound and color Doppler images of a patient with acute penile fracture in conjunction with literature.
