{"id":86495,"title":"Video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy with the patient in the semi-prone position: initial experience and benefits of lymph node dissection.","abstract":"Recently, the prone position has been used for thoracoscopic oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer because it is known to facilitate mediastinal dissection. We hypothesized that this advantage of the prone position could apply to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which has been commonly performed with the patient in the lateral position.Forty-six patients with clinical stage I, right-sided, non-small cell lung cancer were enrolled in this study. They were classified into three groups: conventional thoracotomy using rib retractors (n = 17), and the lateral (n = 15) and semi-prone (n = 14) positions in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Surgical parameters, such as operation time, the amount of blood loss, and the number of dissected lymph nodes, of each group of patients were compared.There were three (6.5 %) minor complications in this study, chylothorax and heart failure in the thoracotomy group and atelectasis with the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in the lateral position group. No complications were seen in the semi-prone group. The number of dissected lymph nodes was significantly higher in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in the semi-prone position group than in the conventional thoracotomy group for inferior mediastinal nodes (subcarinal, paraeosophageal, and pulmonary ligament, average 8.9 and 5.9 lymph nodes, p = 0.04).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that has described video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy with the patient in the semi-prone position. Although the number of cases was limited, the results of this study show that the semi-prone position could be attempted especially for right lower lobe lung cancer.","date":"2014-10-04","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770883","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Atelectasis","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelectasis"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Thoracoscopy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracoscopy"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.545523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.515544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Chylothorax","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chylothorax"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.243787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.230524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.14672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.130353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Retractor (medical)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractor_(medical)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Prone position","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prone_position"}]}
