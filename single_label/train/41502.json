{"id":41502,"title":"[Surgery for anal incontinence: developments in the past two decades and future directions].","abstract":"Studies showing the frequency of anal incontinence and its social and economic impact have driven progress in surgical treatment, from muscle repair by myorraphy (mainly posterior myorraphy) or sphincteroplasty by direct suture of the external anal sphincter some 20 years ago, to invasive surgery with implantation of an artificial anal sphincter in 1993, mini-invasive surgery based on sacral nerve stimulation in 1998, failure of mini-invasive procedures with injection of a bulking agent or radiofrequency in 2000-2010, and development in 2012 of cellular therapy based on injection of autologous myoblasts. Progress in functional gut exploration (anorectal manometry, electrophysiological tests, endoanal ultrasonography, MRI, colonic transit time) and better knowledge of colonic and ano-rectal physiology will lead to further surgical advances.","date":"2014-06-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919374","annotations":[{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.835149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.803296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.727042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.704066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.587905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.520715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.442418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.409374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.305017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sphincter ani externus muscle","weight":0.298425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter_ani_externus_muscle"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.291224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.221043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Myoblast","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoblast"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Sacral nerves","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacral_nerves"},{"name":"Manometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometry"},{"name":"Anorectal manometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_manometry"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Radar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"}]}
