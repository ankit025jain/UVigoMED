{"id":66227,"title":"Association of age and BP variability with long-term mortality in hemodialysis patients.","abstract":"Blood pressure (BP) variability is known as a poor prognostic factor for cardiovascular outcomes. This study assessed the prognostic significance of BP variability in association with increasing age in hemodialysis patients.We retrospectively analyzed 2,174 patients on hemodialysis from March 2005 to December 2012. The impact of intradialytic and interdialytic BP variability on all-cause mortality according to age groups was analyzed.Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 5-year cumulative mortality showed higher mortality in patients with higher intradialytic systolic and diastolic BP variability as well as interdialytic systolic and diastolic BP variability (log-rank p=0.006, <0.001, 0.018 and < 0.001) in patients aged <55 years, but not in older age groups. Cox proportional analysis revealed that 5-year mortality was associated with intradialytic diastolic BP variability in patients aged <55 years (HR, 2.03 CI, 1.24-3.32).The overall mortality was associated with BP variability in patients aged <55 years, but not in older ages. This result suggests that younger hemodialysis patients with BP variability require further medical attention and intervention to reduce BP variability.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731993","annotations":[{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.862704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.685517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.639651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.151965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
