{"id":7307,"title":"Evaluation of a 3A-truncated foot-and-mouth disease virus in pigs for its potential as a marker vaccine.","abstract":"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious and economically devastating disease of cloven-hoofed animals in the world. The disease can be effectively controlled by vaccination of susceptible animals with the conventional inactivated vaccine. However, one major concern of the inactivated FMD virus (FMDV) vaccine is that it does not allow serological discrimination between infected and vaccinated animals, and therefore interferes with serologic surveillance and the epidemiology of disease. A marker vaccine has proven to be of great value in disease eradication and control programs. In this study, we constructed a marker FMDV containing a deletion of residues 93 to 143 in the nonstructural protein 3A using a recently developed FMDV infectious cDNA clone. The marker virus, r-HN/3A93-143, had similar growth kinetics as the wild type virus in culture cell and caused a symptomatic infection in pigs. Pigs immunized with chemically inactivated marker vaccine were fully protected from the wild type virus challenge, and the potency of this marker vaccine was 10 PD50 (50% pig protective dose) per dose, indicating it could be an efficacious vaccine against FMDV. In addition, we developed a blocking ELISA targeted to the deleted epitope that could clearly differentiate animals infected with the marker virus from those infected with the wild type virus. These results indicate that a marker FMDV vaccine can be potentially developed by deleting an immunodominant epitope in NSP 3A.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885414","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Complementary DNA","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Eradication of infectious diseases","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.643316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.580419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Contagious disease","weight":0.573692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagious_disease"},{"name":"Foot-and-mouth disease","weight":0.551911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease"},{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.519579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.506654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.402246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.182608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0818184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Inactivated vaccine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
