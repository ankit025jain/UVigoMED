{"id":24539,"title":"Bivalirudin and transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a cautionary tale.","abstract":"Bivalirudin is an accepted alternative to heparin for anticoagulation during select cardiac procedures. Its use has not been well described during transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Herein is the report of a transcatheter valve replacement case that was complicated by catastrophe and need for emergent cardiopulmonary bypass. A successful outcome was achieved. However, the inability to rapidly reverse the anticoagulation effect of bivalirudin proved troublesome, and that provides for a cautionary tale about its use during transcatheter valve replacement.
