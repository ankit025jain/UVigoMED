{"id":22740,"title":"[Incidence and prevalence of candidemia in critically ill patients in Colombia].","abstract":"Candidemia is an infectious complication with high morbidity and mortality in intensive care patients.The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and prevalence of candidemia in critically ill patients in Colombian hospitals between 2004 and 2008.Data from microbiologically confirmed candidemia cases, ICU stay and admissions were retrospectively recorded in 7 Colombian hospitals between 2004 and 2008. Time series analysis was performed with monthly incidence (number of cases of candidemia in relation to the number of patient-days) and prevalence (number of cases of candidemia in relation to the number of admissions) for each institution and the whole group.382 cases of candidemia were identified, with an incidence of 2,3 cases per 1.000 patient-days in ICU, and a prevalence of 1,4%. There was a trend to increased incidence (0,0066 additional cases per 1.000 ICU-days per month) and prevalence (0,0016 additional cases por 100 patients per month) of candidemia. This increase of candidemia cases was due to a rise of non- albicans Candida species, which corresponded to 44% of total isolates.Candidemia cases in colombian ICUs are increasing, especially those caused by non albicans Candida species.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522301","annotations":[{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.774413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.684517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.660371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.5352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.532968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.384306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.320576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Time series","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.112913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Fungemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungemia"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Colombian people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombian_people"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"}]}
