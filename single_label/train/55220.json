{"id":55220,"title":"Role of optical coherence tomography in posterior segment eye disorders: a review of two cases.","abstract":"Optical Coherence Tomography produces high resolution tomographic in in vivo imaging of biological tissues. The study reviews OCT images of two patients with varied retinal pathologies to determine its usefulness in aiding evaluation and management of retinal diseases. The patients were imaged using OCT conventional fundus photography and angiography. A case each of premacular haemorrhage and idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, are presented highlighting the merits of OCT. OCT establishes the accurate diagnosis of retinal diseases and in monitoring response to therapy. It is complementary to clinical techniques of direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, conventional fundus photography, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography thus should be made readily available for use in the evaluation of retinal disorders to enhance their management.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956623","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Ophthalmoscopy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmoscopy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.80416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.790876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.771703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.676714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.604378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.584706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.27628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.276157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.156848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Posterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Indocyanine green","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indocyanine_green"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Green","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green"},{"name":"Preclinical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preclinical_imaging"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"}]}
