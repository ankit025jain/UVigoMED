{"id":38570,"title":"Rare case of obturator hernia in a patient with Marfan's syndrome.","abstract":"Obturator hernia is a very rare type of abdominal hernia which constitutes <1 % of all the hernias. It is an important cause of small bowel obstruction which is associated with a high mortality rate if left untreated. Obturator hernia typically occurs in an elderly women or patients with chronically raised intraabdominal pressure or previous multiple pregnancies. We report a case of obstructed obturator hernia in a young female patient with Marfan's syndrome complicated with dissecting aortic aneurysm and chronic kidney disease. Though recurrent and incisional hernia constitutes one of the minor diagnostic criteria of Marfan's syndrome, obturator hernia being a very rare entity, has been reported very rarely in a patient with Marfan's syndrome.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415041","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.844331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Aortic dissection","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.783564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.717004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.709729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.684821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.672482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.6387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Incisional hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia"},{"name":"Obturator hernia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obturator_hernia"},{"name":"Multiple birth","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth"}]}
