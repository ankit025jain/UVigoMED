{"id":39678,"title":"Long-term safety and efficacy of certolizumab pegol in the treatment of Crohn's disease: 7-year results from the PRECiSE 3 study.","abstract":"The efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol (CZP) in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease were demonstrated in two 26-week double-blind studies (PRECiSE 1 & 2).To report the safety and efficacy outcomes of long-term, CZP therapy from PRECiSE 3, in which patients received treatment up to 7 years treatment.Patients completing PRECiSE 1 or 2 were eligible to enter PRECiSE 3 in which they received CZP 400 mg, open-label, every 4 weeks (without additional induction therapy) for up to 7 years, for up to 91 doses from study start. Safety (adverse events, including infections and malignancies) and efficacy (Harvey-Bradshaw Index, faecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein) were prospectively monitored. Remission was analysed using observed cases, last observation carried forward imputation and nonresponder imputation.A total of 595 patients entered the study; 117 (20%) completed 7 years. Discontinuation rates were 29.2%, 13.6%, 16.1%, 7.9%, 5.0%, 4.5% and 3.9% (years 1-7 respectively). During 1920 patient-years of exposure to CZP, no new safety signals were observed. Incidence rates (new cases/100 patient-years) for serious infections and malignant neoplasms were 4.37 and 1.06 respectively. No lymphoproliferative malignancies were reported. Clinical remission rates were ?68% at each year (observed cases); rates by last observation carried forward and nonresponder imputation were 58% and 45% at year 1, 56% and 26% at year 3 and 55% and 13% at year 7 respectively.","date":"2014-09-18","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146586","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.528829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.342151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Certolizumab pegol","weight":0.229468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certolizumab_pegol"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lymphoproliferative disorders","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoproliferative_disorders"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1"},{"name":"595","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/595"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Forward (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football)"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Year Seven","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Seven"},{"name":"Return to Sender (Dexter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Sender_(Dexter)"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"}]}
