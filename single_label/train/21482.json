{"id":21482,"title":"[Factors associated with infection from the use of peripherally inserted central catheters in a neonatal intensive care unit].","abstract":"This was an epidemiological, longitudinal and analytical study carried out in a hospital in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, with the aim of analyzing the factors associated with infection due to the use of peripherally inserted central catheters in newborn infants hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Data were collected via a structured form, filled out by the professionals and checked by the researchers. We studied a total of 291 catheters inserted into 233 neonates. The factors associated with catheter removal due to suspected infection were: prematurity; birthweight < or =1500 g; polyurethane catheter; non-centralized placing of the catheter; and duration of use >30 days. After multivariate adjustment, the following factors remained independently associated: weight < 2500 g at the time of insertion, catheter repair, and duration of catheter use. We concluded that factors related to staff practices contributed to removal of the catheters, indicating a need for interventions that improve the safety and efficacy of catheter use.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601128","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.765848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.630211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.471877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.436381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.189634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.111474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.0779046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Polyurethane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane"},{"name":"Minas Gerais","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais"},{"name":"States of Brazil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Brazil"},{"name":"1500","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500"},{"name":"291","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/291"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"233 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/233_(number)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
