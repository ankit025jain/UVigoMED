{"id":30642,"title":"[Analysis of clinical effects of parenterally administered shenqi fuzheng on renal function].","abstract":"This study analyzes the clinical effects of parenterally administered Shenqi Fuzheng on renal function. 20 national, general hospitals were selected. Their hospital information system (HIS) data on 51 898 cases of parenterally administered Shenqi Fuzheng were mined for data. Patients ranged from 18 to 80 years old. 27 718 cases were selected for analysis. Serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were taken before and after treatment for outcome evaluation. According to instructions, we divided 197 cases into the treatment group (doses > 250 mL) and 5 728 cases acted as the control group (dose < or = 250 mL). Stratified analysis adjusted for age, sex, hospital illness, treatment, etc. According to the four variables, the case group compared with the control group did not show abnormal renal function changes; 57 confounding factors were balanced using propensity score method resulting in the treatment group showing no abnormal changes in renal function. This HIS b data analysis found that parenterally administered Shenqi Fuzheng above the recommended dosage did not significantly impact on renal function was no significant difference. Prospective studies should be carried out to validate this data.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471326","annotations":[{"name":"Blood urea nitrogen","weight":0.910859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_urea_nitrogen"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.724329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.671311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.667473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.588739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.301662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Serum creatinine","weight":0.291457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_creatinine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.111175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hospital information system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_information_system"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"197","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/197"},{"name":"898","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/898"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Information system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Verification and validation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
