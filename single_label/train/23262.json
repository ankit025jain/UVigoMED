{"id":23262,"title":"RNA biology and the adaptation of Cryptococcus neoformans to host temperature and stress.","abstract":"Cryptococcus neoformans is an environmental fungus that can cause severe disease in humans. C. neoformans encounters a multitude of stresses within the human host to which it must adapt in order to survive and proliferate. Upon stressful changes in the external milieu, C. neoformans must reprogram its gene expression to properly respond to and combat stress in order to maintain homeostasis. Several studies have investigated the changes that occur in response to these stresses to begin to unravel the mechanisms of adaptation in this organism. Here, we review studies that have explored stress-induced changes in gene expression with a focus on host temperature adaptation. We compare global messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data compiled from several studies and identify patterns that suggest that orchestrated, transient responses occur. We also utilize the available expression data to explore the possibility of a common stress response that may contribute to cellular protection against a variety of stresses in C. neoformans. In addition, we review studies that have revealed the significance of post-transcriptional mechanisms of mRNA regulation in response to stress, and discuss how these processes may contribute to adaptation and virulence.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497369","annotations":[{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.817473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.470755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.447438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Cryptococcus neoformans","weight":0.4162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus_neoformans"},{"name":"Fight-or-flight response","weight":0.172891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Combat","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat"},{"name":"Pattern recognition","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Social environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment"},{"name":"Compiler","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"},{"name":"Muhammad","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad"},{"name":"Combat stress reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_stress_reaction"}]}
