{"id":73987,"title":"Oncogenic roles of EMT-inducing transcription factors.","abstract":"The plasticity of cancer cells underlies their capacity to adapt to the selective pressures they encounter during tumour development. Aberrant reactivation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an essential embryonic process, can promote cancer cell plasticity and fuel both tumour initiation and metastatic spread. Here we discuss the roles of EMT-inducing transcription factors in creating a pro-tumorigenic setting characterized by an intrinsic ability to withstand oncogenic insults through the mitigation of p53-dependent oncosuppressive functions and the gain of stemness-related properties.
