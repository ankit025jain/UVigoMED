{"id":86757,"title":"Treg cells expressing the coinhibitory molecule TIGIT selectively inhibit proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cell responses.","abstract":"Foxp3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells regulate immune responses and maintain self-tolerance. Recent work shows that Treg cells are comprised of many subpopulations with specialized regulatory functions. Here we identified Foxp3(+) T cells expressing the coinhibitory molecule TIGIT as a distinct Treg cell subset that specifically suppresses proinflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell, but not Th2 cell responses. Transcriptional profiling characterized TIGIT(+) Treg cells as an activated Treg cell subset with high expression of Treg signature genes. Ligation of TIGIT on Treg cells induced expression of the effector molecule fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2), which promoted Treg-cell-mediated suppression of T effector cell proliferation. In addition, Fgl2 was necessary to prevent suppression of Th2 cytokine production in a model of allergic airway inflammation. TIGIT expression therefore identifies a Treg cell subset that demonstrates selectivity for suppression of Th1 and Th17 cell but not Th2 cell responses.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745333","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.725994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.714305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.694342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.691877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.598643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.597282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.459712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.238913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
