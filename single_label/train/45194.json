{"id":45194,"title":"Interleukin 15 receptor alpha rs2228059 A > C polymorphism decreased risk of gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma in a Chinese population.","abstract":"Gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma (GCA) is one of the common malignant tumors in the world and has a high incidence in China. Both environmental risk factors and genetic factors might play an essential role in the GCA carcinogenesis. We performed a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate the genetic effects of interleukin 15 (IL15) and IL15 receptor alpha (IL15RA) functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the pathogenesis of GCA. A total of 243 GCA cases and 476 controls were enrolled in this study. The genotypes were determined using a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNPscan(TM) Kit. When the IL15RA rs2228059 AA homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the CC genotype was correlated with a significantly decreased risk for GCA (CC vs. AA: adjusted OR = 0.61, 95 % CI = 0.37-0.98, p = 0.042). Our results revealed that functional variant IL15RA rs2228059 A > C might attenuate individual's risk of GCA. However, there was no significant association between the other five IL15 SNPs and GCA susceptibility. This present study demonstrated that IL15RA rs2228059 A > C polymorphism might modify GCA susceptibility. The results were based on a limited sample size; future larger studies with more rigorous designs are warranted to validate our findings.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696261","annotations":[{"name":"Homozygote","weight":0.824566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygote"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"China","weight":0.693187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.668095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.486957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.472176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.45027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
