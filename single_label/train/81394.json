{"id":81394,"title":"Treatment of ectopic eruption of permanent mandibular first molars with innovative dental appliances.","abstract":"Ectopic eruption (EE) of a first permanent molar occurs during mixed dentition. However, treatment of first permanent mandibular molar EE has been seldom reported.The cases of an 8-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy are described, whose EE first permanent mandibular molars were correctly positioned after treatment with a dental appliance comprising a lingual arch, sectional arch, crimpable hook, and power chain or a simple molar controller, respectively. Both dental appliances are technically easy to construct, require short chair time, induce little discomfort on the patient, and ensure high-level treatment efficiency.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25101497","annotations":[{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.506562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.46404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.234793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.123677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0682477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Electrical engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Dental braces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"},{"name":"Chairman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
