{"id":3109,"title":"Prevention of peri-induction hypertension in preeclamptic patients: a focused review.","abstract":"Many medications have been used to prevent the hypertensive response to the induction of general anesthesia and laryngoscopy in preeclamptic patients, with varying results. In this focused review, we summarize the available data and pharmacologic profiles of these drugs. Several different drug classes may be used safely; however, magnesium bolus, lidocaine, calcium channel antagonists other than nicardipine, and hydralazine are not recommended. Further research is warranted into the hemodynamic impact of varying the induction drug dose or combining different classes of drugs.
