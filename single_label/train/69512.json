{"id":69512,"title":"High-normal serum uric acid predicts the development of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preserved kidney function.","abstract":"We evaluated whether high-normal serum uric acid (SUA) levels can predict the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preserved kidney function at baseline.This was a retrospective observational longitudinal study of patients presenting at the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Pusan National University Hospital. A total of 512 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preserved kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ? 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and normouricemia were included. The main outcome was development of CKD of stage 3 or greater. The patients were divided into four groups according to quartiles of SUA levels.During the follow-up period, 62 (12.1%) patients had progressed to CKD 3 or greater. The group with the highest-normal range of SUA (Q4) showed a higher cumulative incidence of CKD stage 3 or greater than that of the other lower quartiles (Q4 vs. Q3; P = 0.037, Q4 vs. Q2; P<0.001, Q4 vs. Q1; P<0.001). In a univariate analysis, Q4 was significantly associated with the development of CKD 3 or greater (log-rank statistic, 31.93; P<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, Q4 (hazard ratio, 2.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-7.71; P = 0.025) showed a significant association with CKD 3 or greater.High-normal SUA may predict the occurrence of CKD stage 3 or greater in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preserved kidney function.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438886","annotations":[{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.726288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.703035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.659399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.634778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.317942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0474058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Statistic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
