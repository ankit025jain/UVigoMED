{"id":83490,"title":"Pain as a late emotional reaction. Clinical research evaluating the psychosocial expression of pain disorder in preoperative and postoperative period.","abstract":"A comparative analysis of the influence of psychosocial factors on pain perception in preoperative and postoperative period in patients scheduled for abdominal surgery.A psychological assessment was performed in 50 patients without psychiatric history scheduled for abdominal surgery. The verbal expression of pain, intensity of anxiety, catastrophizing level, and the interpersonal relationships were assessed.Surgery has a powerful effect on the perception of pain intensity. Postoperatively patients perceive significantly lower pain than in the preoperative period (p = 0.001). In the postoperative period the patients mainly use emotional and evaluative verbal expressions (p = 0.000 and p = 0.000, respectively), have a high index of anxiety (p = 0.000), adopt a higher level of coping self-statements (p = 0.002), and have a higher level of perception of others (family, friends) (p = 0.005).In patients undergoing surgery, surgery affects their psyche, triggering a series of events that can have psychological effects on pain intensity, doctor-patient relationship, postoperative complications, and shortening of recovery time.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341289","annotations":[{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.697567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.290671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Psyche (psychology)","weight":0.267891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psyche_(psychology)"},{"name":"Psychiatric history","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_history"},{"name":"History","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.157091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Verbal abuse","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_abuse"},{"name":"Facial expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"},{"name":"Nociceptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociceptor"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Abdominal surgery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_surgery"},{"name":"Pain disorder","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_disorder"}]}
