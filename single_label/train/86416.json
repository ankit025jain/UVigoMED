{"id":86416,"title":"Metabolic activity of the tongue in obstructive sleep apnea. A novel application of FDG positron emission tomography imaging.","abstract":"The metabolic activity of the tongue is unknown in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Tongue electromyographic (EMG) activity is increased in patients with OSA. This increase in tongue EMG activity is thought to be related to either increased neuromuscular compensation or denervation with subsequent reinnervation of the muscle fibers. Increased glucose uptake in the tongue would support increased neuromuscular compensation, whereas decreased glucose uptake in the tongue would support denervation with subsequent reinnervation of the muscle fibers.To investigate the metabolic activity of the genioglossus and control upper airway muscles in obese patients with sleep apnea compared with obese control subjects.Obese subjects with and without OSA underwent a standard overnight sleep study to determine an apnea-hypopnea index. Each subject had a positron emission tomography with [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose scan in addition to noncontrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Glucose uptake was quantified within upper airway tissues with the standardized uptake value.We recruited 30 obese control subjects (apnea-hypopnea index, 4.7 ± 3.1 events per hour) and 72 obese patients with sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index, 43.5 ± 28.0 events per hour). Independent of age, body mass index, sex, and race, patients with OSA had significantly reduced glucose uptake in the genioglossus (P = 0.03) in comparison with obese normal subjects. No differences in standardized uptake value were found in the control muscles (masseter [P = 0.38] and pterygoid [P = 0.70]) and subcutaneous fat deposits (neck [P = 0.44] and submental [P = 0.95]) between patients with OSA and control subjects.There was significantly reduced glucose uptake in the genioglossus of patients with sleep apnea in comparison with obese normal subjects with [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography imaging. The reduction in glucose uptake was likely secondary to alterations in tongue muscle fiber-type or secondary to chronic denervation. The reduced glucose uptake argues against the neuromuscular compensation hypothesis explaining the increase in tongue EMG activity in obese patients with OSA.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779734","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission
