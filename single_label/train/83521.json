{"id":83521,"title":"Simulated flying altitude and performance of continuous positive airway pressure devices.","abstract":"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is used in air ambulances to treat patients with impaired oxygenation. Differences in mechanical principles between CPAP devices may affect their performance at different ambient air pressures, as will occur in an air ambulance during flight.Two different CPAP systems, a threshold resistor device and a flow resistor device, at settings of 5 and 10 cm H?O were examined. Static pressure, static airflow, and pressure during simulated breathing were measured at ground level and at three different altitudes [2400 m (7874 ft), 3000 m (9843 ft), and 10,700 m (35,105 ft)].When altitude increased, the performance of the two CPAP systems differed during both static and simulated breathing pressure measurements. With the threshold resistor CPAP, measured pressure levels were close to the preset CPAP level. Static pressure decreased 0.71 ± 0.35 cm H?O at CPAP 10 cm H?O compared to ground level and 35,105 ft (10,700 m). With the flow resistor CPAP, as the altitude increased, CPAP produced pressure levels increased. At 35,105 ft (10,700 m), the increase was 5.13 ± 0.33 cm H?O at CPAP 10 cm H?O.The velocity of airflow through the flow resistor CPAP device is strongly influenced by reduced ambient air pressure, leading to a higher delivered CPAP effect than the preset CPAP level. Threshold resistor CPAP devices seem to have robust performance regardless of altitude. Thus, the threshold resistor CPAP device is probably more appropriate for CPAP treatment in an air ambulance cabin, where ambient pressure will vary during patient transport.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329941","annotations":[{"name":"Atmospheric pressure","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.634073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Altitude","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.608726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Aerodynamics","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Resistor","weight":0.444734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor"},{"name":"Static pressure","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_pressure"},{"name":"Positive airway pressure","weight":0.315579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure"},{"name":"Flight","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.281557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.224882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.210743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Ambulance","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Air ambulance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_ambulance"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Statics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statics"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Runway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"HO scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HO_scale"},{"name":"Casualty movement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_movement"},{"name":"Static (DC Comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)"},{"name":"3000 metres","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3000_metres"},{"name":"Aircraft cabin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_cabin"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Ambient music","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music"},{"name":"Ambient pressure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_pressure"}]}
