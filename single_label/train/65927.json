{"id":65927,"title":"Sustained exposure to the investigational Kisspeptin analog, TAK-448, down-regulates testosterone into the castration range in healthy males and in patients with prostate cancer: results from two phase 1 studies.","abstract":"Kisspeptin-54, an endogenous naturally occurring ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor-54, stimulates GnRH-gonadotropin secretion and suppresses metastases in animal models of cancer but is subject to rapid degradation and inactivation. TAK-448 is an investigational oligopeptide analog of the fully active 10-amino acid C terminus of kisspeptin-54. This phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of TAK-448 in healthy subjects and patients with prostate cancer (PC).Healthy subjects aged 50 years or older received TAK-448 sc as a single-bolus or 2-hour infusion (0.01-6 mg/d; part A) and as a 14-day sc administration (0.01-1 mg/d; part B). In a subsequent, open-label, phase 1 study in PC patients aged 40-78 years, TAK-448 was given as a 1-month depot formulation.Eighty-two healthy subjects received TAK-448; 30 received placebo. Grades 1-2 adverse events were reported in 26% of subjects during TAK-448 treatment. All dosing regimens resulted in dose-proportional exposures. The maximum observed plasma concentration occurred after 0.25-0.5 hours, and median terminal elimination half-life was 1.4-5.3 hours. T increased approximately 1.3- to 2-fold by 48 hours after a single bolus or 2 hour injections, whereas during the 14-day infusion, at doses above 0.1 mg/d, T dropped to below-baseline values by 60 hours and reached a subsequently sustained below-castration level by day 8. In PC patients, T decreased to less than 20 ng/dL in four of five patients dosed with 12 or 24 mg TAK-448 sc-depot injections. The prostate-specific antigen decreased greater than 50% in all patients dosed with 24 mg.Continuous TAK-448 infusion was well tolerated by healthy males and resulted in sustained T suppression. Depot injection in patients with PC similarly reduced T and resulted in prostate-specific antigen responses.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762108","annotations":[{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.815861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"C-terminus","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-terminus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Castration","weight":0.715558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.715421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.651063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.480419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Bolus (medicine)","weight":0.468888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.362303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.354078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.323438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.229404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Kisspeptin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisspeptin"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"}]}
