{"id":25957,"title":"Successful treatment of renal artery embolism even forty-eight hours after event.","abstract":"Renal artery embolism is a disease that is easily missed due to its infrequent and nonspecific presentations. Although early diagnosis and optimal thrombolytic treatment can sometimes restore renal function, therapeutic guidelines have not yet been established. However, early anticoagulant therapy is beneficial and selective infusion of lytic agents into renal artery has been reported with increasing frequency and efficacy if used in the early stage. We report that intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy with low dose of 35 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) may be an effective and safe strategy for the treatment of renal artery embolism, despite the period of ischemia being longer than 48 hours.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163240","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.827783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.812222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.615348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Lytic cycle","weight":0.44204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytic_cycle"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.253154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"}]}
