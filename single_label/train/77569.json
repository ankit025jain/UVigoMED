{"id":77569,"title":"[Lifestyle-related disease, stroke and coronary artery disease].","abstract":"Work exerts considerable influence on human health. Recent meta-analysis has shown that work stress such as long working hours increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Long working hours has been reported to increase the risk of obesity, hypertension and diabetes although there are some conflicting data. Reduced physical activity, late dinner and shortening of sleep hours associated with long working hours could exacerbate lifestyle-related diseases. Neuroendocrine activation due to psychosocial stress may also be related to. In Japan, law concerning stabilization of employment of older persons has been enacted in 2013, indicating that number of old workers increase after this. It is important to establish healthy work environment for people to work until 65 yrs old without suffering from cardiovascular events.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605528","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.712948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.660996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.597067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.538544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.47403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.375564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.290125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.26053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.180374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.120445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Working time","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"}]}
