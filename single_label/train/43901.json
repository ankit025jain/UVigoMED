{"id":43901,"title":"Analysis of the survival of cirrhotic patients enlisted for liver transplantation in the pre- and post-MELD era in southern Brazil.","abstract":"Transplantation is the only cure for decompensated cirrhosis. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is used in liver allocation.Comparing survival of enlisted populations in pre- and post-MELD eras and estimating their long-term survival.This is a retrospective study of cirrhotics enlisted for transplantation during pre- and post-MELD eras. Survival curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier's model. Cox's model was used to determine risk factors for mortality. Exponential, Weibull's, normal-log and Gompertz's models were used to estimate long-term survival.The study included 162 patients enlisted in pre-MELD era and 184 in post-MELD period. Kaplan-Meier's survival curve of patients enlisted in post-MELD era was better than that of pre-MELD period (P = 0.009). This difference remained for long-term estimates, with a survival of 53.54% in 5 years and 44.64% in 10 years for patients enlisted in post-MELD era and of 43.17% and 41.75% for pre-MELD period. Era in which patients had been enlisted (P = 0.010) and MELD score at enlistment (P<0.001) were independently associated to survival with hazard ratios of 0.664 (95% CI-confidence interval = 0.487-0.906) and 1.069 (95% CI = 1.043-1.095).MELD-based transplantation policy is superior to chronology-based one, promoting better survival for enlisted patients, even in long-term.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760064","annotations":[{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.820631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.643381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.298737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.270223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"906","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/906"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Decompensation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation"},{"name":"Survival skills","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_skills"},{"name":"Enlisted rank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Armed forces","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_forces"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Economic system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system"},{"name":"South Region, Brazil","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil"},{"name":"Coxs River","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxs_River"}]}
