{"id":82080,"title":"RANKL expression in periodontal disease: where does RANKL come from?","abstract":"Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease characterized by periodontal pocket formation and alveolar bone resorption. Periodontal bone resorption is induced by osteoclasts and receptor activator of nuclear factor-?B ligand (RANKL) which is an essential and central regulator of osteoclast development and osteoclast function. Therefore, RANKL plays a critical role in periodontal bone resorption. In this review, we have summarized the sources of RANKL in periodontal disease and explored which factors may regulate RANKL expression in this disease.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719884","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoclast","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoclast"},{"name":"Gingival and periodontal pocket","weight":0.866122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_and_periodontal_pocket"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.803857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.798719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.303171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.296944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"RANKL","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANKL"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
