{"id":82522,"title":"Combined arsenic trioxide-cisplatin treatment enhances apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.","abstract":"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for the majority of oral cancers. Despite recent advances in OSCC diagnostics and therapeutics, the overall survival rate still remains low. Here, we assessed the efficacy of a combinatorial arsenic trioxide (ATO) and cisplatin (CDDP) treatment in human OSCC cells.The combinatorial effect of ATO/CDDP on the growth and apoptosis of OSCC cell lines HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4 was evaluated using MTT and annexin V assays, respectively. Chou-Talalay analyses were preformed to evaluate the combinatorial effects of ATO/CDDP on the dose-reduction index (DRI). To clarify the mechanism underlying the ATO/CDDP anticancer effect, we also examined the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ATO/CDDP-induced apoptosis.Combination index (CI) analyses revealed that a synergistic interaction of ATO and CDDP elicits a wide range of effects in HSC-2 cells, with CI values ranging from 0.78 to 0.90, where CI?<?1 defines synergism. The CI values in HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells ranged from 0.34 to 0.45 and from 0.60 to 0.92, respectively. In addition, ATO/CDDP yielded favorable DRI values ranging from 1.6-fold to 7.71-fold dose reduction. Compared to mono-therapy, ATO/CDDP combinatorial therapy significantly augmented the loss of mitochondrial potential, caspase-3/7 activity and subsequent apoptosis. These changes were all abrogated by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine.This study provides the first evidence for a synergistic ATO/CDDP anticancer (apoptotic) activity in OSCC cells with a favorable DRI, thereby highlighting its potential as a combinational therapeutic regime in OSCC.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599717","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Arsenic trioxide","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_trioxide"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.752328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.728546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Arsenic","weight":0.72278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.719076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.697579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.587145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.543093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.392243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.270474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.245836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Dietary Reference Intake","weight":0.118961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
