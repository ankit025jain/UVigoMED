{"id":3652,"title":"Fertility preservation in patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy.","abstract":"The preservation and restoration of fertility are key aspects for enhancing quality of life in cancer survivors. Cytotoxic agents and radiation can produce gonadal dysfunction in both men and women. Survival rates for cancers that occur before or during reproductive age have improved dramatically. Current fertility preservation options are available but limited in males and females. Referral to a reproductive endocrinologist around the time of diagnosis is important to optimize treatment options.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25438367","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Endocrinology","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.738373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gonad","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonad"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.221176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Reproductive endocrinology and infertility","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_endocrinology_and_infertility"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.194526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Fertility preservation","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_preservation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Survival (Doctor Who)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_(Doctor_Who)"}]}
