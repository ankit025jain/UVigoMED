{"id":19326,"title":"IL6-174 G/C gene polymorphism and its relation to serum IL6 in Egyptian children with community-acquired pneumonia.","abstract":"Cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The aim of this study is to investigate the association of IL6-174 G/C gene polymorphism with CAP in Egyptian children, to assess its effect on CAP outcome and to determine its effect on the serum IL6 levels in these children. IL6-174 G/C gene polymorphism was genotyped in 210 Egyptian children (100 patients with CAP and 110 healthy controls) using PCR-RFLP, while the serum IL6 levels were measured by ELISA method. We found a significant association between the GG genotype, G allele of IL6-174 G/C SNP and susceptibility to CAP (P=0.02, 0.01 respectively). However, GG genotype and G allele were protective against severe sepsis (p=0.004), acute respiratory failure (p<0.001) and hospital mortality (p<0.001). Serum IL6 levels were significantly increased in these children while there was no relation between GG genotype and serum IL6. In conclusion, IL6-174 G/C gene polymorphism may contribute to susceptibility to CAP in Egyptian children.
