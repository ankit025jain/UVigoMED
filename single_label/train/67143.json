{"id":67143,"title":"Prognostic role of NLR in urinary cancers: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Recently, many studies explored the role of inflammation parameters such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the prognosis of urinary cancers, but the results were not consistent.We carried out a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the prognostic value of NLR in patients with urinary cancers. Hazard ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association of NLR and OS and RFS/CSS.The pooled results showed that high NLR was a poor predictor for OS with HR of 1.81 (95%CI: 1.48-2.21; Pheterogeneity?=?0.005) and RFS/CSS (HR?=?2.07, 95% CI: 1.65-2.6; Pheterogeneity?=?0.849). Subgroup analyses revealed that high NLR yielded a worse OS in RCC (HR?=?1.9, 95%CI: 1.47-2.45; Pheterogeneity?=?0.003) and a poor RFS/CSS in RCC (HR?=?1.83, 95%CI: 1.35-2.48; Pheterogeneity?=?0.709), bladder cancer (HR?=?2.2, 95%CI: 1.27-3.8; Pheterogeneity?=?0.447) and urothelial carcinoma (HR?=?2.58, 95%CI: 1.66-4.01; Pheterogeneity?=?0.784).Our results showed that NLR could act as a significant biomarker in the prognosis of urinary cancers.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642859","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.93643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.549488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.202457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Croatian Radiotelevision","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Radiotelevision"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"784","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/784"},{"name":"849","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/849"},{"name":"652","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/652"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"North London Railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_Railway"}]}
