{"id":81749,"title":"Oral manifestations of suspected eating disorders among women of 20-25 years in Bangalore City, India.","abstract":"To detect the presence of eating disorders (EDs) and clinical findings in 20-25 years old women residing in professional college hostels in Bangalore city, India, a cross-sectional study was conducted. One hundred seventeen women of the 128 selected randomly participated in the study. SCOFF [Sick, Control, One-stone (14 lbs/6.5 kg), Fat, Food] Questionnaire was used for screening suspected cases of anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). Examination was done for systemic findings, extra-oral and intra-oral manifestations of EDs. Data obtained were analyzed using SPSS (version 13.0). The response rate was 71.3%, of which 42.7% were suspected to have EDs by SCOFE Examination showed significantly higher prevalence of periomylolysis (p = 0.004), dental caries (p = 0.004), and tooth sensitivity (p = 0.001) in suspected cases. The study succeeded at 'case-finding' of EDs with a significant prevalence of oral manifestations in suspected cases. Thus, dentists play a major role for early detection and prompt further referral of co-morbid disorders, like EDs.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847592","annotations":[{"name":"Anorexia nervosa","weight":0.919709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa"},{"name":"Bulimia nervosa","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa"},{"name":"Eating disorder","weight":0.811179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.79307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.704381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"India","weight":0.629401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.610366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.351625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.182783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.144121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"College","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Bangalore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Dentine hypersensitivity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentine_hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Pound (mass)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"2025","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025"},{"name":"Chess960","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Hostel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostel"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Anguttara Nikaya","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguttara_Nikaya"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
