{"id":44733,"title":"Anatomic versus non-anatomic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review.","abstract":"To evaluate the feasibility and therapeutic effects of anatomic liver resection versus non-anatomic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized trials comparing the clinical effectiveness between anatomic and non-anatomic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma were identified by using a predefined search strategy. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled survival and recurrence rate.No Randomized controlled trial was identified. Twelve non-randomized comparative trials (10 in English and 2 in Chinese) including total 1,829 cases, 1,005 cases in anatomic resection group and 824 cases in non-anatomic resection group, were included in this review. Meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between anatomic and non-anatomic liver resection in 1-year survival rate (p = 0.98), 3-year survival rate (p = 0.75), 5-year survival rate (p = 0.38) and recurrence rate (p = 0.44). The differences in post-operative morbidity (p = 0.32) and blood loss during operation (p = 0.11) were also not statistically significant.Anatomic liver resection for HCC does not provide significant benefit in 1-year/3-year/5-year survival rate, recurrence rate, post-operative morbidity and blood loss during operation compared with non-anatomic resection.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719944","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.759233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.723939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.715254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.292857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"China","weight":0.214197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.101538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0381889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Hepatectomy","weight":0.0243874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatectomy"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
