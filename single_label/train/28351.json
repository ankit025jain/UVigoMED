{"id":28351,"title":"Management of a mixed overdose of calcium channel blockers, ?-blockers and statins.","abstract":"We describe a case of extreme mixed overdose of calcium channel blockers, ?-blockers and statins. The patient was successfully treated with aggressive resuscitation including cardiac pacing and multiorgan support, glucagon and high-dose insulin for toxicity related to calcium channel blockade and ?-blockade, and ubiquinone for treating severe presumed statin-induced rhabdomyolysis and muscle weakness.
