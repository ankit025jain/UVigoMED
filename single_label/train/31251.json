{"id":31251,"title":"The impact of Hispanic and white group cues on attitudes towards the violation of generic norms.","abstract":"While much work in political science has examined the impact of racial cues on individual perceptions, we know little about how individuals evaluate members of minority outgroups on issues that are not linked to stereotypes. We measure the impacts of Hispanic and White cues on individual assessments related to a stereotype-independent norm violation: alcoholism. We test three competing theories--cognition, intergroup emotions, and social identity--using a population-based vignette experiment included in the General Social Survey. Our results contradict much of the literature, but keep with social identity theory's predictions. Hispanic alcoholics, when Hispanics constitute the outgroup, are assessed less negatively than White alcoholics in the ingroup, the latter experiencing what is called the black sheep effect. The black sheep effect occurs when ingroup members are more punitive towards members of the ingroup than the outgroup. However, the black sheep effect does not extend to measures that are more consistent with outgroup stereotypes, such as violence or money mismanagement; Hispanic alcoholics are evaluated more negatively than Whites on these measures. The implication is that the effect of racial cues depends strongly on issue linkages to group stereotypes.","date":"2014-01-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24386153","annotations":[{"name":"Political science","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Stereotype","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.653418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Social identity","weight":0.614865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.566255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Violence","weight":0.560485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Ingroups and outgroups","weight":0.518568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.447718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.442974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.284306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Money","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Sketch comedy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.0248068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Entailment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entailment"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Punishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment"}]}
