{"id":79283,"title":"Squamous cell carcinoma of larynx in an 8-year-old child: successful management with chemo-radiation.","abstract":"Incidence of laryngeal squamous cell cancer (SCC) in childhood is rare, more so in children below 10 years of age. Due to the rarity of the disease and nonspecific symptoms diagnosis often gets delayed. Treatment is challenging and demands expert multi-modality care. We describe the clinico-pathologic findings and management of laryngeal cancer with chemo-radiation in an 8-year-old male. After 18 months of completion of treatment the child is in complete remission clinically and radiologically. This report aims at increasing awareness of head and neck SCC in paediatric population and also underscores the importance of multi-modality care in managing such cases.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453121","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.56717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.334694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.31953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.311111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.198736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0193016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
