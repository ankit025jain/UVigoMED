{"id":28528,"title":"A case report of historical trauma among American Indians on a rural Northern Plains reservation.","abstract":"This case report describes historical trauma on a rural American Indian reservation and outlines participatory action approaches for nurses. The prevalence of historical trauma often goes unnoticed by healthcare professionals because of its multifaceted nature and subsequent lack of provider understanding. Nurses accustomed to looking only for physical and psychosocial signs of trauma may not specifically understand how to align significant historical trauma events with prevention, education, and healthcare delivery. Nursing interventions developed through participatory action and directed at individual, family, and community levels of care are most effective in treating and preventing cumulative effects of historical trauma.
