{"id":51730,"title":"Peripheral arterial disease, gender, and depression in the Heart and Soul Study.","abstract":"Despite the high prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in women, risk factors for PAD in women are not well understood.Gender-specific risk factors for PAD were examined in a prospective cohort study of 1024 patients (184 women and 840 men) with stable coronary artery disease who were recruited between 2000 and 2002. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between traditional and nontraditional risk factors and PAD in men and women.PAD was found in 11% of women and in 13% of men. Women with PAD had a similar prevalence of traditional risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking) compared with women without PAD and were significantly more likely to suffer from depression than women without PAD. Men with PAD were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a history of smoking, a worse lipid profile, and higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers than men without PAD. A multivariate model showed depression was the strongest independent factor associated with PAD in women, whereas smoking and elevated fibrinogen were independently associated with PAD in men.The current findings suggest there are gender differences in risk factors for the development of PAD. Further research is needed to understand the role of depression in PAD.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661811","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.778015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.709619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.583523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.379552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.312667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0448853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0334287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Soul","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
