{"id":52920,"title":"Roles of HNF1? and HNF4? in pancreatic ?-cells: lessons from a monogenic form of diabetes (MODY).","abstract":"Mutations in the genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1? and HNF4? cause a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The primary cause of MODY is an impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic ?-cells, indicating the important roles of HNF1? and HNF4? in ?-cells. Large-scale genetic studies have clarified that the common variants of HNF1? and HNF4? genes are also associated with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that they are involved in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Recent experimental studies revealed that HNF1? controls both ?-cell function and growth by regulating target genes such as glucose transporter 2, pyruvate kinase, collectrin, hepatocyte growth factor activator, and HNF4?. In contrast, HNF4? mainly regulates the function of ?-cells. Although direct target genes of HNF4? in ?-cells are largely unknown, we recently identified Anks4b as a novel target of HNF4? that regulates ?-cell susceptibility to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Studies of MODY have led to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic ?-cells.
