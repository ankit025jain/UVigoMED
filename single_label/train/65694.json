{"id":65694,"title":"[Geriatric patients with chronic kidney insufficiency: which antalgia?].","abstract":"Pain is a leading cause of office visits. In the geriatric population, it is known that the prevalence of renal failure increases exponentially with age, modifing the elimination of drugs and of their metabolites. What analgesia should be offered to these patients? The holy grail would be a medication without renal elimination, without toxic metabolites and without nephrotoxicity. Based on the literature we try to propose a specific approach to analgesia in older patients with kidney insufficiency, in order to help practitioners to better prescribe for this group of patients.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791426","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.860244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Metabolite","weight":0.675211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.636121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.585964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.401363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.244349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Exponential growth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"},{"name":"Sacred","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred"},{"name":"Holy Grail","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail"},{"name":"Exponential decay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay"}]}
