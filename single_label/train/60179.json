{"id":60179,"title":"Pallidal deep brain stimulation in the treatment of Meige syndrome.","abstract":"Meige syndrome (MS) is characterized by blepharospasm, facial, oromandibular, and often cervical dystonia. The medical treatment of this condition is challenging and unsuccessful over long time. Recent case reports and small clinical series showed that bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) improves dystonic features of MS validated by Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS).We report on our experience in using bilateral GPi DBS in 3 cases of MS. We present short-term (3 months) follow-up as well long-term (from 8 months to 36 months) results. Preoperative and postoperative BFMDRS assessments were performed on each patient. The postoperative BFMDRS scores was done when both stimulators were switched on and compared to baseline scores.Bilateral GPi DBS reduced the BFMDRS total movement score by 66% at short-term follow-up, and by 75% at long-term follow-up when compared to baseline scores. The BFMDRS total disability score was reduced by 34% at short-term follow-up, and by 47% at long-term follow-up when compared to baseline scores.Our results showed that bilateral GPi DBS in MS is effective and safe, if conservative treatment options failed. The benefit is not only observed at short-term 3 months period but is maintained at long-term follow-up ranging from 8 to 36 months.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981184","annotations":[{"name":"Dystonia","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystonia"},{"name":"Deep brain stimulation","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.710405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Globus pallidus","weight":0.556505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_pallidus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.507022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.347966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.327891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Blepharospasm","weight":0.238889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blepharospasm"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Meige's syndrome","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meige's_syndrome"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Total permanent disability insurance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_permanent_disability_insurance"},{"name":"Globus pharyngis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_pharyngis"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Medial globus pallidus","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_globus_pallidus"},{"name":"Direct-broadcast satellite","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-broadcast_satellite"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
