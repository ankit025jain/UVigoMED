{"id":47917,"title":"Application of lobaplatin in trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization for primary hepatic carcinoma.","abstract":"To explore the efficiency of single application of lobaplatin in tran-scatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with a primary hepatic carcinoma who were unable or unwilling to undergo surgery.173 patients with primary hepatic carcinoma diagnosed by imaging or pathology were randomly divided into experimental and control groups and respectively treated with lobaplatin and pirarubicin hydrochloride as chemotherapeutic drugs for TACE. The amount of iodipin was regulated according to the tumor number and size, and then gelatin sponge or polyvinyl alcohol particles were applied for embolisms. The efficiency of treatment in the two groups was compared with reference to survival time and therapeutic response.The experimental group (single lobaplatin as chemotherapy drug) was superior to control group (single pirarubicin hydrochloride as chemotherapy drug) in the aspects of survival time and therapeutic response, with statistical significance.Single lobaplatin can be as a chemotherapy drug in TACE and has better efficiency in the aspects of mean survival time and therapeutic response, deserving to be popularized in the clinic.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568472","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.830373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.774944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.728498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.700456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.6919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.66182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.499001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Sponge","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"},{"name":"Gelatin","weight":0.35085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin"},{"name":"Hydrochloride","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloride"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Polyvinyl chloride","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Polyvinyl alcohol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_alcohol"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
