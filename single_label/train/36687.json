{"id":36687,"title":"Vitamin D hormone regulates serotonin synthesis. Part 1: relevance for autism.","abstract":"Serotonin and vitamin D have been proposed to play a role in autism; however, no causal mechanism has been established. Here, we present evidence that vitamin D hormone (calcitriol) activates the transcription of the serotonin-synthesizing gene tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) in the brain at a vitamin D response element (VDRE) and represses the transcription of TPH1 in tissues outside the blood-brain barrier at a distinct VDRE. The proposed mechanism explains 4 major characteristics associated with autism: the low concentrations of serotonin in the brain and its elevated concentrations in tissues outside the blood-brain barrier; the low concentrations of the vitamin D hormone precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D3]; the high male prevalence of autism; and the presence of maternal antibodies against fetal brain tissue. Two peptide hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin, are also associated with autism and genes encoding the oxytocin-neurophysin I preproprotein, the oxytocin receptor, and the arginine vasopressin receptor contain VDREs for activation. Supplementation with vitamin D and tryptophan is a practical and affordable solution to help prevent autism and possibly ameliorate some symptoms of the disorder.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558199","annotations":[{"name":"Oxytocin","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Tryptophan","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.829794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Vasopressin","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tryptophan hydroxylase","weight":0.721073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan_hydroxylase"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peptide hormone","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_hormone"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.58019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Hydroxylation","weight":0.534623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.458923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Oxytocin receptor","weight":0.286128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin_receptor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.280862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Passive immunity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_immunity"},{"name":"Vasopressin receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin_receptor"},{"name":"TPH2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPH2"},{"name":"TPH1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPH1"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Protein precursor","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_precursor"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
