{"id":47191,"title":"Wnt-induced secreted protein 1/CCN4 in liver fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo.","abstract":"Wnt-induced secreted protein-1 (WISP-1/CCN4) is a member of the CCN family growth factors, and its role in liver fibrosis is largely unknown.For in vitro, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats. Expression of WISP-1 during progressive activation of cultured rat HSCs was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The effects of TNF-a and TGF-beta1 on WISP-1 expression were analyzed in stellate cell lines HSC-T6 and LX-2. The effect of exogenous WISP-1 protein on LX-2 proliferation was examined. For in vivo, expressions of WISP-1 in fibrotic liver of a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced fibrosis rat model were analyzed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.In vitro, WISP-1 was increasingly expressed during progressive activation of cultured rat HSCs. WISP-1 was significantly induced in HSC-T6 cells by TNF-a and in LX-2 cells by TGF-beta1. Recombinant WISP-1 protein promoted LX-2 proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, both mRNA and protein expression levels of WISP-1 were increased significantly in experimental hepatic fibrosis model.Our results showed the upregulation of WISP-1 in both in vitro and in vivo liver fibrosis models, and WISP-1 stimulated the proliferation of HSCs in vitro. These results may be helpful to elucidate the exact role of WISP-1 in liver fibrogenesis.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600972","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha","weight":0.770054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.76079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.62819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.518773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Carbon tetrachloride","weight":0.430486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.297409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Osteonectin","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteonectin"},{"name":"Stellate cell","weight":0.267177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellate_cell"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
