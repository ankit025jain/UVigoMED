{"id":55243,"title":"[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the psychiatric practice--case reports of the ataxic and Heidenhain variant].","abstract":"Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a rare fatal neurodegenerative brain disorder of variable clinical manifestation. Making the right diagnosis still remains challenging. First symptoms are vague and differ between clinical subtypes of the disease. This is to present the symptoms variability and diagnostic difficulties in sCJD based on case reports of two female patients examined at time of the disease duration by psychiatrists.Data of our patients were collected from hospital medical records.The case of patient A. P.' ataxic sCJD is an example of clinical picture suggesting neurological background of the disease almost from the symptoms' onset and being referred by psychiatrist to the neurological ward, where the right diagnosis of probable sCJD was established. In the opposite is the case of patient I. W.' Heidenhain variant of sCJD, misdiagnosed with dissociative disorder delivering huge diagnostic difficulties, even to neurologists. In both patients the certain diagnosis was confirmed at autopsy.In patients with visual disturbances of unknown etiology, even if the ophthalmological and neurological background is excluded, sCJD should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946444","annotations":[{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Psychiatrist","weight":0.677576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.541196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.426962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.329215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Dissociative disorder","weight":0.20437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_disorder"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Dissociation","weight":0.0845608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Vision disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
