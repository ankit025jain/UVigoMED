{"id":38591,"title":"Granular corneal dystrophy: a novel approach to classification and treatment.","abstract":"The purpose of this case report is to review granular corneal dystrophy (GCD) and examine the new paradigm in its classification and treatment.A 49-year-old white male patient reported yearly for monitoring of GCD. He had an ocular surgical history in the left eye for penetrating keratoplasty in 1989 and phototherapeutic keratectomy with mitomycin C for graft recurrence of stromal bread-crumb opacities 17+ years later in 2002. At his last examination, the patient's vision and comfort was stable in each eye, with minimal recurrence of granular opacities in the left surgical eye, stable granular opacities in the right eye, no recurrent corneal erosion symptoms in either eye, and best spectacle-corrected vision of 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS.GCD is a Category 1, Stromal, TGFBI-associated corneal dystrophy. Although it is classified as a stromal dystrophy, research suggests the possibility that the granular opacities have an origination to the corneal epithelium with a migratory effect to the corneal stroma. Patients with Groenouw I, like the one in this report, usually do not have severely compromised vision. When vision is significantly affected or recurrent corneal erosion occurs, despite first- and second-line treatments, viable management options thereafter include photokeratectomy and other new surgical treatments such as femtosecond deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty and femtosecond laser-assisted keratoplasty. Future advancements in diagnostic technology, immunohistologic and genetic testing, medications, and surgery will allow for advancements in treating and managing patients with GCD.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
