{"id":76925,"title":"Effects of metformin and exercise training, alone or in association, on cardio-pulmonary performance and quality of life in insulin resistance patients.","abstract":"Metformin (MET) therapy exerts positive effects improving glucose tolerance and preventing the evolution toward diabetes in insulin resistant patients. It has been shown that adding MET to exercise training does not improve insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of MET and exercise training alone or in combination on maximal aerobic capacity and, as a secondary end-point on quality of life indexes in individuals with insulin resistance.75 insulin resistant patients were enrolled and subsequently assigned to MET (M), MET with exercise training (MEx), and exercise training alone (Ex). 12-weeks of supervised exercise-training program was carried out in both Ex and MEx groups. Cardiopulmonary exercise test and SF-36 to evaluate Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was performed at basal and after 12-weeks of treatment.Cardiopulmonary exercise test showed a significant increase of peak VO2 in Ex and MEx whereas M showed no improvement of peak VO2 (? VO2 [CI 95%] Ex +0.26 [0.47 to 0.05] l/min; ? VO2 MEx +0.19 [0.33 to 0.05] l/min; ? VO2 M -0.09 [-0.03 to -0.15] l/min; M vs E p?<?0.01; M vs MEx p?<?0.01; MEx vs Ex p?=?ns). SF-36 highlighted a significant increase in general QoL index in the MEx (58.3?±?19 vs 77.3?±?16; p?<?0.01) and Ex (62.1?±?17 vs 73.7?±?12; p?<?0.005) groups.We evidenced that cardiopulmonary negative effects showed by MET therapy may be counterbalanced with the combination of exercise training. Given that exercise training associated with MET produced similar effects to exercise training alone in terms of maximal aerobic capacity and HRQoL, programmed exercise training remains the first choice therapy in insulin resistant patients.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884495","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.881596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.647315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.358068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.170898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"VO2 max","weight":0.0317239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.0310796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Cardiac stress test","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_stress_test"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Computer programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"},{"name":"712","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/712"},{"name":"319","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/319"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
