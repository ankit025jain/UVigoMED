{"id":56406,"title":"Role for rapid surgical intervention in uveal effusion syndrome with associated optic neuropathy.","abstract":"Uveal effusion syndrome (UES) can be associated with nanophthalmos and rarely can present with concomitant optic neuropathy. This case report describes nanophthalmic UES and optic neuropathy treated with early sclerectomies. One month postoperatively, the patient experienced significant improvement in choroidal effusions and optic neuropathy, with increases in visual acuity and visual fields. Early scleral windows surgery for UES with associated optic neuropathy can provide prompt improvement of choroidal swelling, optic nerve edema, and vision, although the relapsing course of this disease presents a challenge to long-term visual prognosis.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695046","annotations":[{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Optic nerve","weight":0.783059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.774748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Visual field","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_field"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.580126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.281557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Uvea","weight":0.159466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvea"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Optic neuropathy","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuropathy"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Optic disc","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_disc"},{"name":"Scleral lens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleral_lens"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
