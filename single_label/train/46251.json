{"id":46251,"title":"[The early postoperative rehabilitation of the patients presenting with cholelithiasis and experiencing psychoemotional stress].","abstract":"Early postoperative rehabilitation of the patients presenting with cholelithiasis and experiencing psychoemotional stress is designed to restore the function of bile secretion, enhance their adaptive capabilities, and normalize the psychovegetative status for the purpose of preventing further progress of the disease and reducing the risk of the development of post-cholecystectomy syndrome. The inclusion of drinking mineral water, magnetic laser therapy, and UHF therapy in the combined rehabilitative treatment of such patients results in the appreciable enhancement of all functional abilities of the body manifest as the significant improvement and normalization of clinical and laboratory characteristics (elimination of clinical symptoms of the disease, improvement of general and biochemycal parameters of peripheral blood). Simultaneously, the adaptive capabilities and the psychovegetative status of the patients improved as apparent from the increased lymphocyte count, normalization of the Kerdo and Hildebrandt indices and indices of stress level, decreased psychoemotional stress, enhancement of physical functioning characteristics. Taken together, these changes account for the high effectiveness of the above procedures of early postoperative rehabilitation of the patients presenting with cholelithiasisand experiencing psychoemotional stress (94.7%).","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640655","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.897798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.759404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.462611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.412888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mineral water","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_water"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.3615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.359272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.3352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.334694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0485161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Ultra high frequency","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
