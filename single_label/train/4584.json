{"id":4584,"title":"[Fibroblasts and lung fibrosis].","abstract":"Fibroblasts are key cells in the fibrotic process. Their profibrotic phenotype is influenced by the environment in which they operate, both extracellular matrix and mediators which they are exposed. The pharmacologic modulation of the fibroblast phenotype allows to identify potential therapeutic targets which might interrupt the vicious cycle of pulmonary fibrogenesis.","date":"2014-11-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25362768","annotations":[{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.821334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.596811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.462163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.403001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Pulmonary fibrosis","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Interrupt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Virtuous circle and vicious circle","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle"}]}
