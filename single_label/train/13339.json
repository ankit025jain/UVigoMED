{"id":13339,"title":"Effect of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccination on PCV2-viremic piglets after experimental PCV2 challenge.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccines on PCV2-viremic and -seropositive piglets born from naturally PCV2-infected sows against postnatal PCV2 challenge. The experimental design was aimed at mimicking commercial swine rearing conditions to evaluate the response of the PCV2 vaccine on PCV2-viremic and -seropositive piglets after experimental PCV2 challenge. PCV2a (or 2b)-viremic piglets received a PCV2 vaccine at 21 days of age followed by a PCV2b (or 2a) challenge at 49 days of age (28Â days post vaccination). The PCV2 vaccines elicited a high level of humoral (as measured by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay and neutralizing antibody titers) and cellular (as measured by the frequency of PCV2-specific interferon-?-secreting cells) immune response in the PCV2-viremic piglets after vaccination even in the presence of maternally derived antibodies (MDA). The initial infection of PCV2 in the pigs was not affected by PCV2 vaccination, however the challenging PCV2 was reduced by PCV2 vaccination on PCV2-viremic pigs. The results from this study demonstrate that the PCV2 vaccine used in this study is effective at reducing PCV2 viremia and lymphoid PCV2 DNA, even for PCV2-viremic pigs with passively acquired MDA at the time of vaccination.
