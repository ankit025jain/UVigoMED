{"id":37601,"title":"[Clinical characterization and mutation identification for multiple sulfatase deficiency patients in China].","abstract":"Multiple sulfatase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of sulfated lipids and acid mucopolysaccharides. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical manifestations, enzyme activities and SUMF1 gene mutations in two Chinese patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency.One boy and one girl from two families were studied. Both patients presented with mental retardation, mild coarse facial features, a neurodegenerative course of disease with loss of sensory and motor function after 2 years of age, ichthyosis and skeletal abnormalities (kyphosis or/and scoliosis). Clinical characteristics indicate multiple sulfatase deficiency.Sulfatases activities in blood leucocytes, plasma or cultured fibroblast of the patients were measured.Genomic DNAs were extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes from the patients and their parents. All SUMF1 gene exons and intron-exon boundaries were amplified by PCR and subjected for direct sequencing.In case 1, five sulfatases activities of blood leucocytes and four sulfatases of cultured skin-fibroblasts were analyzed.In case 2, three sulfatases activities of blood leucocytes were tested.Significantly decreased sulfatases activities confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sulfatase deficiency.On SUMF1 gene, c.793_794 insATG (p. P265X)/ c.1045C>T (p.R349W) in case 1 and c.451A>G (p.K151E)/ c.1046G>C (p.R349Q) in case 2 were detected, respectively. Three novel mutations c.793_794insAGT, c.1046G>C and c.451A>G were identified.Multiple sulfatase deficiency usually results in multi-organ damage, especially neurologic, skeletal and skin.Sulfatases assay and SUMF1 gene analysis are necessary for the diagnosis. Two Chinese cases with multiple sulfatase deficiency were firstly reported. Three novel mutations were found.It should be considered that the mutation profile of SUMF1 gene in Chinese patients is different from other populations.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Congenital
