{"id":53872,"title":"Randomized trials of PCIs versus CABG surgery: why coronary stenting should remain the first choice of revascularization in non-diabetic patients and why the controversy is still present in diabetics.","abstract":"Knowing the best revascularization option for diabetic patients with multiple vessel disease is a challenge without a definitive answer. There have been several randomized clinical trials and subsequent meta-analyses comparing current available technology trying to reach an exhaustive conclusion; comparisons between coronary artery bypass grafts and bare-metal stents, coronary artery bypass grafts and first generation drug-eluting stents and, most recently, first generation versus latest generation drug-eluting stents generated some interesting results. Information provided by pooled data from some of the most important randomized clinical cardiology trials from the last two decades have produced surprising results. The authors analyze these data to discuss the best therapeutic procedures for each patient.
