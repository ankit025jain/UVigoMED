{"id":89021,"title":"Arthroscopic findings of coexisting lesions with greater tuberosity fractures.","abstract":"Proximal humerus fractures comprise approximately 5% of all fractures, with isolated greater tuberosity fractures accounting for approximately 20% of proximal humerus fractures. Although performing shoulder arthroscopy in situations including a fracture is technically demanding, it allows surgeons the opportunity to identify and treat other coexisting lesions that could have otherwise been missed. The incidence of these pathologies in combination with greater tuberosity fractures has not been established. This study aimed to identify the various types of pathologies that may coexist with greater tuberosity fractures but not be detected before fixation. Displaced 2-part greater tuberosity fractures were treated arthroscopically in the authors' department. All patients initially underwent diagnostic arthroscopy during which other coexisting pathologies were detected and assessed, including rotator cuff tears, labral tears (Bankart or superior labral anterior posterior lesions), or long head of the biceps pathologies. Twenty-four patients underwent arthroscopic (n=10) or arthroscopic-assisted (n=14) greater tuberosity reduction and fixation. Thirteen (54.2%) fragments were fully displaced. Four (16.7%) patients had fracture dislocation of the glenohumeral joint. The concomitant soft-tissue pathologies were identified and treated arthroscopically in 22 (92%) patients. Arthroscopic evaluation before greater tuberosity fracture fixation revealed a high percentage of concomitant soft tissue pathologies. These pathologies may be overlooked otherwise, but they are easily detected arthroscopically, enabling their treatment during the same procedure.
