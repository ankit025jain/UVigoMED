{"id":85162,"title":"Assessing the relationship among urban trees, nitrogen dioxide, and respiratory health.","abstract":"Modeled atmospheric pollution removal by trees based on eddy flux, leaf, and chamber studies of relatively few species may not scale up to adequately assess landscape-level air pollution effects of the urban forest. A land use regression (LUR) model (R(2) = 0.70) based on NO2 measured at 144 sites in Portland, Oregon (USA), after controlling for roads, railroads, and elevation, estimated every 10 ha (20%) of tree canopy within 400 m of a site was associated with a 0.57 ppb decrease in NO2. Using BenMAP and a 200 m resolution NO2 model, we estimated that the NO2 reduction associated with trees in Portland could result in significantly fewer incidences of respiratory problems, providing a $7 million USD benefit annually. These in-situ urban measurements predict a significantly higher reduction of NO2 by urban trees than do existing models. Further studies are needed to maximize the potential of urban trees in improving air quality.
