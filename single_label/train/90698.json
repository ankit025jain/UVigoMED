{"id":90698,"title":"The potential efficacy of noninvasive ventilation with administration of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor for acute respiratory distress syndrome.","abstract":"Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether the combination of NIV with administration of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor could improve outcome and respiratory conditions in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-patients, according to the Berlin definition.ARDS-patients were treated with NIV and a neutrophil elastase inhibitor. Patients were classified as having mild, moderate, and severe ARDS. ARDS-patients were divided into survivors and nonsurvivors on day 28 after the induction of NIV.A total of 47 ARDS-patients received NIV, and 37 of these patients did not require endotracheal intubation. Eight mild, 17 moderate, and 10 severe ARDS-patients were alive on day 28 after the induction of NIV. When ARDS-patients were divided into groups based upon an initial PaO2/FiO2 greater or less than 150 torr, the serial changes of both the PaO2/FiO2 and the lung injury score improved dramatically in those patients with a PaO2/FiO2>150. The survival ratio showed statistically significant differences in mild and moderate ARDS-patients treated with the neutrophil elastase inhibitor.Administration of neutrophil elastase inhibitor with NIV may be associated with successful outcome in mild-to-moderate ARDS-patients with initial PaO2/FiO2>150.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582826","annotations":[{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.878612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Tracheal intubation","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.767691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.754552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Infant respiratory distress syndrome","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Tracheal tube","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_tube"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.662117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.514481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.241289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.13286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"FiO2","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiO2"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Berlin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Labor induction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction"}]}
