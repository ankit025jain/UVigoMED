{"id":92773,"title":"Eruptive hypomelanosis: a novel exanthem associated with viral symptoms in children.","abstract":"Recognition of different clinical presentations of viral and virally triggered (\"paraviral\") exanthems is necessary for patients to be appropriately diagnosed and counseled.Nine children presented with eruptions of hypopigmented macules following coryzal symptoms. Other diagnostic considerations, such as pityriasis alba, pityriasis versicolor, and progressive macular hypomelanosis, were excluded. This novel clinical presentation, eruptive hypomelanosis, may represent a paraviral exanthem with a prodromal coryzal phase, sudden eruption of fairly monomorphic lesions, and predictable time course with spontaneous resolution.Eruptive hypomelanosis is a novel viral exanthem. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the etiology of this condition and its relationship to other exanthemas and eruptions such as pityriasis rosea.","date":"2014-11-13","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229328","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.789907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Hypopigmentation","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypopigmentation"},{"name":"Exanthem","weight":0.445962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exanthem"},{"name":"Pityriasis alba","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pityriasis_alba"},{"name":"Prodrome","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrome"},{"name":"Tinea versicolor","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea_versicolor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.353195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Pityriasis rosea","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pityriasis_rosea"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Volcano","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Alba (poetry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba_(poetry)"},{"name":"Chiral resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_resolution"},{"name":"Types of volcanic eruptions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Pityriasis","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pityriasis"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
