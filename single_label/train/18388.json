{"id":18388,"title":"[Candidemia combined with bacterial bloodstream infection: analysis of clinical features and associated risk factors].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical characteristics of and risk factors for candidemia combined with bacterial bloodstream infection(BSI) by retrospective analysis of cases.The clinical data of cases diagnosed as candidemia combined with BSI confirmed by blood culture were compared with those of cases with mono-candidemia in Beiing Tongren Hospital from January 2009 to December 2011. A logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the independent risk factors.Forty-two cases diagnosed as candidemia were analyzed including 14 cases of candidemia combined with BSI and 28 cases of mono-candidemia. Ten strains of gram-positive cocci and 4 strains of gram-negative bacilli were isolated from candidemia combined with BSI group.Six strains of C.albicans, 4 strains of C.glabrata, 3 strains of C.tropicalis and 1 strain of C.krosei were isolated. There was no C.parapsilosis isolated from candidemia combined with BSI group but 9 strains in the mono-candidemia group. The septic shock rate of the candidemia combined with BSI group was higher than that of the mono-candidemia group (12/14 vs 7/28, P = 0.000). The mortality rate of the candidemia combined with BSI group was higher than that of the mono-candidemia group (10/14 vs 15/28), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.266).Four factors were found statistically different by univariate analysis, including hospitalization more than 4 weeks (P = 0.001), bacteremia before candidemia(P = 0.005), hematological tumor (P = 0.01) and abdominal infection (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that hospitalization more than 4 weeks was the independent risk factor.Gram-positive cocci were the predominant species and septic shock was more common in candidemia combined with BSI. Hospitalization more than 4 weeks was the independent risk factor for candidemia combined with BSI.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796589","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.746354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.64723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.518114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.503998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.411358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.379825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Coccus","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccus"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.13109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.116999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Fungemia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungemia"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.0125579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"}]}
