{"id":15433,"title":"[Genetic analysis of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae including meropenem resistance that was isolated from elderly residents with pneumonia in nursing-care facilities].","abstract":"From February to December 20XX, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) showing MICs of 16-32 microg/mL to cefotaxime (CTX) and 4-8 microg/mL to meropenem (MEPM) were isolated from 6 patients hospitalized at the general hospital S (2 cases) and hospital A (4 cases), close to the hospital S. Five elderly patients among these six cases came from nursing care facilities or nursing care-related medical facilities. All elderly persons (mean age: 81.7 years) were diagnosed as having pneumonia at the time of admission and the problematic PRSP was isolated from sputum samples collected on admission. Notably, all of these PRSP isolates simultaneously showed high resistance to macrolide agents mediated by an erm (B) gene and to fluoroquinolone agents via mutations in the gyrA and parC genes. Eventually, they were identified as multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae (MDRSP) with high resistance to many agents. The capsule type of all strains was serotype 19F and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that they belonged to clonal complex (CC) 7993, which has not been reported before. It was thus concluded that the MDRSP that had spread within the nursing facilities was transmitted to the general hospitals via the elderly inpatients with pneumonia caused by these agents. Although one case finally had a poor outcome, the pneumococcal infection was not the direct trigger of the event. The current ratio of MDRSP is concluded to be very low. However, general hospitals that accept patients for therapeutic purposes from nursing-care facilities have to share epidemiological information in a timely manner with the nursing homes to prevent nosocomial infections.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199378","annotations":[{"name":"Meropenem","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Macrolide","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"},{"name":"Cefotaxime","weight":0.870581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefotaxime"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.844198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.717802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.698286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.665865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.37754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.312335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.18735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.149485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Medical facility","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_facility"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Multilocus sequence typing","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilocus_sequence_typing"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Pneumococcal infection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_infection"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Cholera toxin","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_toxin"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Bacterial capsule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_capsule"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
