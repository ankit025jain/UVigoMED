{"id":65781,"title":"[Preliminary results of research on a new marker of idiopathic membranous nephropathy: anti-PLA2R].","abstract":"Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) is a chronic glomerular disease. It is result of new discovery that the production of anti-PLA2R autoantibodies, reacting with phospholipase A2 receptor on the surface of podocytes. Specific antibodies occur in IMN patients blood in exacerbated of disease, and disappear during remission. It suggest that analyse of these parameter can prove quick diagnosis to recognize and monitoring treatment process. The aim of our work was to determine anti-PLA2R in patients with suspected IMN and persons during/after treatment in order to monitor the effectiveness of therapy.The study group consisted of 22 patients. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A--patients with symptomatic nephrotic syndrome in the course of membranous nephropathy; Group B--patients diagnosed with IMN who monitored the effectiveness of therapy. We collected the serum samples for all patients and determined of anti-PLA2R autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence test.Antibodies were detected in 12 patients (54.54%): diagnosed (n = 5) and monitor (n = 7). All of patients with exacerbated disease process in monitored group had positive test results.Our data suggest that anti-PLA2R is a sensitive diagnostic method and good for monitoring of disease activity, but nevertheless a need for further research on a larger group of patients to confirm that the test is a reliable source of diagnostic information.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779214","annotations":[{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.762925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Membranous glomerulonephritis","weight":0.618498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membranous_glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Podocyte","weight":0.454902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocyte"},{"name":"Phospholipase A2","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_A2"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0882121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
