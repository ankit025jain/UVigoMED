{"id":82516,"title":"Spontaneous regeneration of bone after resection of central giant cell lesion: a case report.","abstract":"There are several treatment modalities to date for central giant cell granuloma including conservative treatment and surgical treatment with often planned reconstruction of the bony defect. Spontaneous bone regeneration of mandibular defects following complete resection of mandible has rarely been reported in the literature. We report a case of spontaneous bone formation after resection of a central giant cell granuloma in the anterior mandible of a pediatric patient and the importance of maintaining the periosteum during surgical resection as a rare case report.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600804","annotations":[{"name":"Periosteum","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periosteum"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.795504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.724952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.600389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.39088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.283325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.227954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.180839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Healing factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing_factor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gigantism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantism"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"}]}
