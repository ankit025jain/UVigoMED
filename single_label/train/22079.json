{"id":22079,"title":"On bacteriocin delivery systems and potential applications.","abstract":"Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides produced by a variety of bacteria. These peptides can act as antibiotic synergists or alternatives to enhance the therapeutic effects of current infection treatments and decrease the prevalence of resistant strains. Two bacteriocins, namely nisin and pediocin PA-1, are currently being used by the food industry; however, the introduction of these and others into the biomedical industry, and further development of food applications, have been challenged by the slow development of reliable delivery systems. For bacteriocins, these systems rely on novel and pre-existing technologies. Many essential variables need to be accounted for to formulate successful delivery methods. In this review, documented and potential bacteriocin delivery systems are examined, with special attention paid to how those systems are being implemented in the food and medical industries.
