{"id":9381,"title":"Functional effects of TGF-?1 on mesenchymal stem cell mobilization in cockroach allergen-induced asthma.","abstract":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested to participate in immune regulation and airway repair/remodeling. TGF-?1 is critical in the recruitment of stem/progenitor cells for tissue repair, remodeling, and cell differentiation. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of TGF-?1 in MSC migration in allergic asthma. We examined nestin expression (a marker for MSCs) and TGF-?1 signaling activation in airways in cockroach allergen extract (CRE)-induced mouse models. Compared with control mice, there were increased nestin(+) cells in airways and higher levels of active TGF-?1 in serum and p-Smad2/3 expression in lungs of CRE-treated mice. Increased activation of TGF-?1 signaling was also found in CRE-treated MSCs. We then assessed MSC migration induced by conditioned medium from CRE-challenged human epithelium in air/liquid interface culture in Transwell assays. MSC migration was stimulated by epithelial-conditioned medium, but was significantly inhibited by either TGF-?1-neutralizing Ab or T?R1 inhibitor. Intriguingly, increased migration of MSCs from blood and bone marrow to the airway was also observed after systemic injection of GFP(+) MSCs and from bone marrow of Nes-GFP mice following CRE challenge. Furthermore, TGF-?1-neutralizing Ab inhibited the CRE-induced MSC recruitment, but promoted airway inflammation. Finally, we investigated the role of MSCs in modulating CRE-induced T cell response and found that MSCs significantly inhibited CRE-induced inflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, and IFN-?) by CD4(+) T cells. These results suggest that TGF-?1 may be a key promigratory factor in recruiting MSCs to the airways in mouse models of asthma.
