{"id":88642,"title":"The role of mouse mast cell proteases in the proliferative phase of wound healing in microdeformational wound therapy.","abstract":"Stored in the secretory granules of cutaneous mouse mast cells are mouse mast cell proteases (mMCP-4, -5, and -6). Using transgenic mouse lines that lacked these enzymes, it was shown that mMCP-4 and mMCP-5 modulate the outcome of burn-induced skin injury. Whether or not these proteases also play a role in the repair of surgically damaged skin, with or without microdeformational wound therapy, remains to be determined.Wild-type C57BL/6 mice and transgenic C57BL/6 mouse lines lacking mMCP-4, -5, or -6 were subjected to surgical wounding of their skin. Wounds were splinted with a stabilizing patch, and the mice received either microdeformational wound therapy (n = 5) or occlusive dressing (n = 5) for 7 days. Wound healing parameters were assessed in the proliferative phase.Cell proliferation in the wounded wild-type mice receiving microdeformational wound therapy was 60 ± 3 percent. Cell proliferation was only 35 ± 5 percent, 25 ± 5 percent, and 45 ± 4 percent for the treated mMCP-4-, mMCP-5-, and mMCP-6-null mice, respectively (p = 0.005). Blood vessel sprouting was higher in the control mice with microdeformational wound therapy (170 ± 40 vessels/high-power field) compared with mouse mast cell protease 6-null mice with microdeformational wound therapy (70 ± 20 vessels/high-power field; p = 0.005), and higher in the control mice with occlusive dressing (110 ± 30 vessels/high-power field) compared with mMCP-4-null mice with occlusive dressing (50 ± 20 vessels/high-power field; p = 0.01). Qualitatively, the granulation tissue of all the protease-deficient groups receiving microdeformational wound therapy was disrupted.Results suggest that mouse mast cell proteases 4, 5, and 6 are mediators of the critical role mast cells play in microdeformational wound therapy in the proliferative phase of healing.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814421","annotations":[{"name":"Mast cell","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_cell"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.792201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.739962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.727131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Granulation tissue","weight":0.709712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.649337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.633367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.324556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.302246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Transgenesis","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.206702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Genetically modified mouse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_mouse"}]}
