{"id":61660,"title":"Secondary EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma in a patient previously treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood: a case report.","abstract":"It is widely recognized that the risk of secondary neoplasms increases as childhood cancer survivors progress through adulthood. These are mainly hematological malignancies, and recurrent chromosome translocations are commonly detected in such cases. On the other hand, while secondary epithelial malignancies have sometimes been reported, chromosome translocations in these epithelial malignancies have not. A 33-year-old man who had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and treated with chemotherapy almost 20 years earlier was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. After chromosomal rearrangement of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene was detected in this adenocarcinoma, he responded to treatment with crizotinib. It was therefore concluded that this echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene-positive lung adenocarcinoma was a secondary epithelial malignancy.
