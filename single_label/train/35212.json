{"id":35212,"title":"Modified primary sutureless repair technique of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.","abstract":"Surgical correction of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection is associated with an important risk of postrepair pulmonary vein obstruction. Primary sutureless anastomosis at the time of initial surgical repair might mitigate that risk. A simplified primary sutureless technique is described in this report.
