{"id":41113,"title":"Associations between intakes of individual nutrients or whole food groups and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among Korean adults.","abstract":"Dietary factors are closely associated with the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Asian and Western diets differ in energy-nutrient composition, fatty-acid composition, and main nutritional sources; therefore, the implications would be limited if the Western-oriented study results were applied to Asian patients. We aimed to identify the nutrient and food group intakes of a typical Asian diet and assess their effects on NAFLD risk.In total, 348 subjects were recruited from 5 participating hospitals. Information on sociodemographic characteristics and health-related behaviors were obtained through face-to-face interviews. NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasound. Dietary intakes were assessed with a 24-h recall applying a multiple-pass approach and 4-day food records that included 1 or 2 weekend days.There were no significant differences in health-related behaviors between the cases and controls except for smoking behavior. The cases had elevated triacylglycerol, fasting glucose, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with the controls. In men, after adjusting for variables, low intakes of vitamin C (odds ratio [OR], 4.23), vitamin K (OR, 3.93), folate (OR, 3.37), omega-3 fatty acids (OR, 2.16), and nuts and seeds (OR, 3.66) were associated with a significantly higher risk for developing NAFLD. In women, vitamin K (OR, 2.54) and vegetable (OR, 4.11) intakes showed a significant beneficial effect for lowering NAFLD risk.Adequate intakes of vitamin C, vitamin K, folate, omega-3 fatty acids, nuts and seeds, and vegetables may help in preventing NAFLD in Korean adults.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955455","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Vitamin K","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Nut (fruit)","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Vegetable","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.694376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Whole foods","weight":0.627403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_foods"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.621045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.610968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.580956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.528812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.437265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Food group","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_group"},{"name":"Western pattern diet","weight":0.286487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_pattern_diet"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.252436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.215183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.180731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.156341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0565179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease"}]}
