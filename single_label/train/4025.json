The tested compounds exhibited antiproliferative activity against all the human cell lines, showing comparable MG_MID (mean graph midpoint) values in the range of 0.74-1.15 ?M. A particular efficacy was observed against the leukemia subpanel (GI50 = 0.73-0.0090 ?M). Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle demonstrated an increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase. The compounds caused apoptosis of the cells, mitochondrial depolarization, generation of reactive oxygen species, and activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9. Moreover, they acted as topoisomerase I inhibitors.
