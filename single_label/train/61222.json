{"id":61222,"title":"Kikuchi disease presenting with aseptic meningitis.","abstract":"Kikuchi disease is a self-limited disease characterized primarily by regional lymphadenopathy. Kikuchi disease was first described in 1972 as a lymphadenitis with specific histopathologic findings. Extranodal manifestations have been reported, including rare neurologic complications such as aseptic meningitis. This case report discusses a patient who presented to the ED with signs and symptoms suggestive of aseptic meningitis and was ultimately diagnosed with Kikuchi disease. We also review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings typically found in patients with Kikuchi disease. Inclusion of Kikuchi disease in the differential diagnosis for meningitis may help establish a diagnosis in patients also presenting with regional lymphadenopathy.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746858","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphadenopathy","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenopathy"},{"name":"Aseptic meningitis","weight":0.861261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aseptic_meningitis"},{"name":"Meningitis","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.593473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.508706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Kikuchi disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kikuchi_disease"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Alpha taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_taxonomy"}]}
