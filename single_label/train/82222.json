{"id":82222,"title":"Antral balloon sinus elevation and grafting prior to dental implant placement: review of 34 cases.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to assess the antral balloon technique for sinus elevation followed by bone graft and implant placement.A total of 34 patients with atrophic edentulous posterior maxillary ridges underwent antral balloon sinus elevation followed by bone grafting (autogenous bone retrieved from the chin mixed with platelet-rich plasma) and implant placement.The population consisted of 26 male and 8 female patients with a mean age of 42 years (range, 33 to 56 years). Successful sinus membrane balloon elevation was performed in all 34 patients, and 62 implants were placed. A membrane tear in one patient was managed intraoperatively by placement of a collagen membrane. Two implants failed within 6 months, and the survival rate of the other 60 implants was 100% after 3 years of follow-up. The mean inflated balloon volume was 1.96 mL and the mean elevated sinus height by balloon was 11.6 mm. An average bone gain of 7.5 mm (range, 5.2 to 10.5 mm) was observed.This case series demonstrates the feasibility of antral balloon sinus membrane elevation followed by bone augmentation and implant placement. This technique offers optimal assurance for membrane safety, and it is less invasive than the routine lateral window technique, safe, and associated with less postoperative bleeding and discomfort. This method is predictable, easy to learn, and associated with low complication rates. However, large comparative studies with other techniques are required.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic
