{"id":84953,"title":"[Genetic stability of probiotic lactic acid bacteria--a review].","abstract":"Growing attention has been focused on probiotic lactic acid bacteria because of their important health-promoting effects. Nowadays, probiotic-based products have become fashionable nutraceuticals of choice. Before a newly developed probiotic-based product is to be introduced into the industry, it is important to ensure not only the desirable properties of the probiotic strain but also a good genetic stability. This article firstly introduces the research methods for investigating genetic stability, followed by summarizing the latest research progress in China and overseas.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007647","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.546188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"China","weight":0.396646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Lactic acid bacteria","weight":0.129468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_bacteria"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0690403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Genetic drift","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"}]}
