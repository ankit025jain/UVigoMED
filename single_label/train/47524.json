{"id":47524,"title":"Prevention of colonic spasm using L-menthol in colonoscopic examination.","abstract":"The detailed efficacy of intraluminal L-menthol for preventing colonic spasm is not known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of L-menthol in preventing colonic spasm during colonoscopy.We analyzed 65 patients (mean age: 71.7 years; 49 men and 16 women) who were administered 0.8% L-menthol (MINCLEA, Nihon Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) intraluminally for severe colonic spasm during colonoscopic examination at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine between February 2012 and May 2013. The efficacy of L-menthol was defined as the absence of colonic spasm during a period of 30 s, and its effect was evaluated at 30 s, 1 min, and 5 min after administration. Additionally, various characteristics of these patients were analyzed. Twenty-seven patients with severe colonic spasm were administered intraluminal water and assessed as controls.L-Menthol was effective in preventing colonic spasms in 60.0%, 70.8%, and 46.5% of patients at 30 s, 1 min, and 5 min, respectively. In contrast, water was effective in 22.2%, 29.6%, and 48.1% of patients at 30 s, 1 min, and 5 min, respectively. There was a significant difference about the efficacy at 30 s and 1 min between L-menthol and water (P?=?0.0009, P?=?0.0006).L-Menthol (0.8%) was effective in preventing colonic spasm during colonoscopic examination.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584277","annotations":[{"name":"Japan","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Tokyo","weight":0.298425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Spasm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm"},{"name":"Kyoto","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Prefectures of Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"}]}
