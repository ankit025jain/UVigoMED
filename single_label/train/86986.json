{"id":86986,"title":"Molecular analysis of JC polyomavirus genotypes circulating among tribal populations of North-Eastern West Bengal, India.","abstract":"There is a resurgence of interest in the study of occurrence, genotype and pathogenic associations of human Polyomaviruses in recent years. In the present study, we have ascertained the presence of human Polyomavirus JC (JCV) in the urine and peripheral blood leukocytes of tribal populations, for the first time in the North-Eastern part of West Bengal State of India. We have also characterized the prevalent genotypes of the non-coding controlregions (NCCRs) of these natural isolates. The result suggests a high incidence of JCV reactivation in the populations assayed. Approximately 25% of the non-immunocompromized tribal men and women, tested positive based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, and these results were further confirmed by sequencing of PCR products. Pairwise sequence comparison and alignment of the NCCR sequence of these Indian strains appeared to be comparable and related to the archetypal JCV (CY) and the Tibetan LH3 strains, with some alterations in few key positions. The sequence analyses were done with regard to transcription factor binding to DNA sequence elements of endemic JCV NCCRs.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25115113","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.816008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.738551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.668921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.658556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.633002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.608469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"India","weight":0.560555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.514478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.244357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Archetype","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.120576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Polyomavirus","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomavirus"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"West Bengal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal"},{"name":"Tribe","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe"},{"name":"JC virus","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_virus"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Tibet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet"},{"name":"Sequence alignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Bengal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
