{"id":43074,"title":"Epiregulin promotes the emergence and proliferation of adult liver progenitor cells.","abstract":"We have previously reported that epiregulin is a growth factor that seems to act on liver progenitor cells (LPCs) during liver regeneration. However, the relationship between epiregulin and LPCs has remained unclear. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of epiregulin during liver regeneration. The serum levels of epiregulin in patients with acute liver failure were examined. A liver injury model was developed using mice fed a diet containing 0.1% 3.5-diethoxycarbonyl-1.4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) to induce LPCs. We then evaluated the expression of epiregulin and LPCs in these mice. The proliferation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule + LPCs cultured with epiregulin was examined in vitro, and finally epiregulin was overexpressed in mouse liver. In patients with acute liver failure, serum epiregulin levels were elevated significantly. In DDC mice, LPCs emerged around the portal area. Epiregulin was also detected around the portal area during the course of DDC-induced liver injury and was partially coexpressed with Thy1. Serum epiregulin levels in DDC mice were also significantly elevated. Recombinant epiregulin augmented the proliferative capacity of the LPCs in a dose-dependent manner. In mice showing overexpression of epiregulin, the expression of PCNA on hepatocytes was increased significantly. Finally, LPCs emerged around the portal area after epiregulin gene delivery. We concluded that epiregulin promotes the proliferation of LPCs and DNA synthesis by hepatocytes and is upregulated in the serum of patients with liver injury. Furthermore, induction of epiregulin leads to the appearance of LPCs. Epiregulin would be a useful biomarker of liver regeneration.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812054","annotations":[{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.780391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.719996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.652961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.425368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.425259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.366389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proliferating_cell_nuclear_antigen"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.221708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Gene delivery","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_delivery"}]}
