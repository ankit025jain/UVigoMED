{"id":86649,"title":"A prospective study on ambulatory care provided by primary care pediatricians during influenza season.","abstract":"Aim of this study was to obtain a picture of the nature of the primary care pediatricians' visits during a winter season. We investigated reasons for visits, diagnosis, and pattern of prescription in 284 children. The reason for visit was a planned visit in 54% of cases, a well-being examination in 26%, and an urgent visit for an acute problem in 20% of cases. Cough was the most common symptom reported (61%). The most common pediatricians' diagnosis was flu-like syndrome (47%). No disease was found by pediatrician in 27% of children with a symptom reported by caregivers. Antibiotics were prescribed in 25% of children, the vast majority of which affected by viral respiratory infections. The unjustified access to physician's visit may lead to a inappropriate prescription of drugs.
