{"id":22573,"title":"Characterization of temperate phages infecting Clostridium difficile isolates of human and animal origins.","abstract":"Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive pathogen infecting humans and animals. Recent studies suggest that animals could represent potential reservoirs of C. difficile that could then transfer to humans. Temperate phages contribute to the evolution of most bacteria, for example, by promoting the transduction of virulence, fitness, and antibiotic resistance genes. In C. difficile, little is known about their role, mainly because suitable propagating hosts and conditions are lacking. Here we report the isolation, propagation, and preliminary characterization of nine temperate phages from animal and human C. difficile isolates. Prophages were induced by UV light from 58 C. difficile isolates of animal and human origins. Using soft agar overlays with 27 different C. difficile test strains, we isolated and further propagated nine temperate phages: two from horse isolates (?CD481-1 and ?CD481-2), three from dog isolates (?CD505, ?CD506, and ?CD508), and four from human isolates (?CD24-2, ?CD111, ?CD146, and ?CD526). Two phages are members of the Siphoviridae family (?CD111 and ?CD146), while the others are Myoviridae phages. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme analyses showed that all of the phages had unique double-stranded DNA genomes of 30 to 60 kb. Phages induced from human C. difficile isolates, especially the members of the Siphoviridae family, had a broader host range than phages from animal C. difficile isolates. Nevertheless, most of the phages could infect both human and animal strains. Phage transduction of antibiotic resistance was recently reported in C. difficile. Our findings therefore call for further investigation of the potential risk of transduction between animal and human C. difficile isolates.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532062","annotations":[{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.893697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Bacteriophage","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.795781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Fitness (biology)","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_(biology)"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.755358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.706736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.499804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.494944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.345543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Temperateness","weight":0.325681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperateness"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Human evolution","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0596484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"Plant propagation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_propagation"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
