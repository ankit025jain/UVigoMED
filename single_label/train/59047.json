{"id":59047,"title":"[Home blood pressure measurement and pregnancy].","abstract":"Hypertension during pregnancy is associated with high perinatal morbidity and mortality The prevalence of white coat hypertension is high during pregnancy and is associated with a good prognosis. This must be excluded before beginning antihypertensive treatment. When to use HBPM during pregnancy? To confirm the diagnosis of hypertension; to monitor BP during pregnancy and to alert the obstetrician when severe hypertension occurs; to manage BP treatment and avoid excessive treatment. How to use HBPM during pregnancy? To get an adapted and validated BP device during pregnancy; to compare the results with reference HBP values during the 3Â trimesters of pregnancy. Telemetry to monitor BP at home during pregnancy is a feasible, safe and well-tolerated alternative to repeated clinic visits or BP monitoring during hospitalisations.
