{"id":90316,"title":"Risk of accidental injuries amongst Parkinson disease patients.","abstract":"To investigate the spectrum and risks of accidental injuries (AIs) amongst Parkinson disease (PD) patients.The participants comprised PD patients aged 50 years and older who were initially diagnosed between 2000 and 2009, and a comparison group of non-PD patients. The incidence rates of accidental injury types amongst PD and non-PD patients were calculated; hazard ratios were calculated and adjusted for comorbidities, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing such outcomes in PD patients.In total, 4046 PD patients and 16 184 non-PD patients were followed over time. The PD patients demonstrated the following incidence rates and hazard ratios in comparison to the control cohort for accidental injuries: all injuries, 19.78 per 100 person-years (100 PYs), adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% CI 1.24-1.36); head injury, 2.95 per 100 PYs, HR 1.88 (95% CI 1.64-2.15); bone fracture and dislocation, 4.61 per 100 PYs, HR 1.39 (95% CI 1.25-1.54); burns, 0.66 per 100 PYs, HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.78-1.32); injury to spinal cord, plexus and nerves, 0.15 per 100 PYs, HR 1.25 (95% CI 0.72-2.17); superficial injuries and contusions, 11.41 per 100 PYs, HR 1.20 (95% CI 1.12-1.27). The injury risk for the 69-79 years age group in PD compared with controls of the same age (HR 1.38) was significantly higher compared with that of the 50-69 age groups in PD and controls (HR 1.16).Parkinson disease patients demonstrate a significantly elevated risk of developing all accidental injury types except burn injuries and injuries to spinal cord, plexus and nerves, compared with age-matched controls. The risk increases as age increases.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629012","annotations":[{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bruise","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.681855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.50524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.496419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.439645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.387482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.250192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2000s (decade)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_(decade)"},{"name":"781","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/781"},{"name":"642","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/642"},{"name":"241","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/241"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Brachial plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_plexus"},{"name":"4000 series","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4000_series"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Artificial intelligence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Injury prevention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"}]}
