{"id":87224,"title":"[Case-control study on tibetan Baimai ointment (see symbol in text) for the treatment of wrist-dysfunction after distal radius fracture].","abstract":"To evaluate efficacy and safety of Baimai ointment (see symbol in text) in the treatment of wrist-dysfunction after distal radius fracture.From April, 2011 to June, 2012, 43 patients with distal radius fracture were treated with plaster fixation. All the patients were divided into two group: test group and control group. Twenty-one patients in test group and 22 in control group, and the baseline was balance (P > 0.05). The 21 patients in test group were treated with Baimai ointment (see symbol in text), fomentation, functional exercises. The 22 patients in control group were treated with placebo, fomentation, functional exercises. Foment affected side wrist with wet towel in 20 min before medication, with the temperature between 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C. Smear drugs uniformly in range of 3 cm in the vicinity of palm stripes after drying (about 3 g) and take functional exercises for the activities of wrist and hand. Continuous follow the program per 8 hours once and follow-up for 8 weeks. The Wrist's pain was assessed with VAS. The wrist's activities were measured with the protractor of orthopedic. Measure The grip strength was measured with dynamometer. The wrist's function were assessed with the table of Cooney.The test group had a significantly better results than those of control group in the extent of wrist's pain throughout the treatment (P < 0.001), and grip strength on the 28th day and the 56th day (P < 0.05), and Cooney functional assessment on the 56th day (P < 0.05). Wrist's activities had no significane difference throughout the 8 weeks (P > 0.05). There were no drug adverse reactions occurred.Tibetan Baimai ointment (see symbol in text) has the treatment of wrist-dysfunction after distal radius fracture for external use, which can reduce the extent of wrist's pain, promote grip strength recovery in the middle and late of process, promote wrist's function recovery latterly, and safety for external use.","date":"2015-01-12","categories":"Wounds and
