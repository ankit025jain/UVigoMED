{"id":86146,"title":"Validation of the Spanish version of the Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK) in a population of Hispanic preschoolers.","abstract":"There is a critical need for validation studies of questionnaires designed to assess the level of control of asthma in children younger than 5 years old.To validate the Spanish version of the Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK) questionnaire in children younger than age 5 years with symptoms consistent with asthma.In a prospective cohort validation study, parents and/or caregivers of children younger than age 5 years and with symptoms consistent with asthma, during a baseline and a follow-up visit 2 to 6 weeks later, completed the information required to assess the content validity, criterion validity, construct validity, test-retest reliability, sensitivity to change, internal consistency reliability, and usability of the TRACK questionnaire.Median (interquartile range) of the TRACK scores were significantly different between patients with well-controlled asthma, patients with not well-controlled asthma, and patients with very poorly controlled asthma (90.0 [75.0-95.0], 75.0 [55.0-85.0], and 35.0 [25.0-55.0], respectively, P < .001). TRACK scores were significantly different between patients classified as currently symptomatic and symptomatic in the recent past (42.5 [25.0-55.0] vs 85.0 [75.0-90.0]; P < .001). The intraclass correlation coefficient of the measurements was 0.755 (95% CI, 0.503-1.00). All patients whose clinical status changed showed an increase of 10 or more points in TRACK score between baseline and follow-up visits. The Cronbach ? was 0.77 for the questionnaire as a whole.The Spanish version of the TRACK questionnaire has excellent sensitivity to change and usability; adequate criterion validity, construct validity, and test-retest reliability; and an acceptable internal consistency, when used in children younger than age 5 years with symptoms consistent with asthma.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24811025","annotations":[{"name":"Content validity","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_validity"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.744892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.635324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Construct validity","weight":0.547143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity"},{"name":"Internal consistency","weight":0.511326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.486818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Intraclass correlation","weight":0.435557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"},{"name":"Criterion validity","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_validity"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.284652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.282576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.186487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Cronbach's alpha","weight":0.175837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach's_alpha"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Consistent estimator","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator"},{"name":"Range (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"755","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/755"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Test validity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_validity"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Preschool education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool_education"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Uncial 085","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_085"},{"name":"Usability","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"}]}
