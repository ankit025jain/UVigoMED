{"id":90871,"title":"Canadian health care institution resource utilization resulting from skeletal-related events.","abstract":"We describe the types of major institution health care resources consumed as a result of skeletal-related events (SREs) [ie, pathological fracture, bone surgery, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression].A retrospective multicenter chart review of cancer patients with bone metastases who experienced SREs was conducted. Patients with multiple SREs occurring during the same hospitalization within 21 days of each other were grouped into SRE clusters.We reviewed 156 patient charts from 4 Canadian institutions, accounting for 358 SREs and 259 SRE clusters. Of the total patients, 63% experienced 1 SRE; 19%, 2 SREs; 10%, 3 SREs; and 8%, ? 4 events. Health care resource utilization was captured for ? 90 days following each SRE: 54% of all SRE events resulted in an inpatient stay; 34% in an emergency visit; 85% of SREs required the use of diagnostic procedures (including radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, Computerized Axial Tomography scans, and radio scans); 57% required radiation treatment; 34% required a surgical procedure; 35% received outpatient treatment visits (ie, physiotherapy or occupational therapy). Bone surgery and spinal cord compression were more often associated with hospitalization than were other SRE types. Spinal cord compression was associated with the greatest number of inpatients stays (1.09 per SRE), longest duration of hospital stay (mean 26.18 days per SRE), and more outpatient visits, relative to other SRE types.Results of our Canadian retrospective study clearly demonstrate that SREs occur in cancer patients and each SRE is associated with considerable institutional consumption of health care resources.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566592","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance
