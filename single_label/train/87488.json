{"id":87488,"title":"[Study on the development of a patient dosimetry gown for interventional cardiology procedures].","abstract":"In recent years, dose justification and optimization have been attempted in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); however, deterministic effects have been reported. To prevent radiation skin injuries in PCI, it is necessary to measure the patient entrance skin dose (ESD), but an accurate dose measurement method has not yet been established. In this study, we developed a dosimetry gown that can measure the ESD during PCI using multiple radiophotoluminescence dosimeters (RPLDs). The RPLDs were placed into 84 pockets that were sewn into a dosimetry gown. Patients wear the original dosimetry gown during the procedures, after which we obtain accurate ESD measurements. We believe that this method using RPLDs and a newly-designed dosimetry gown provides accurate ESD measurements during PCI. We expect this system to become a standard method for measuring ESD during PCI.
