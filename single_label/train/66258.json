{"id":66258,"title":"Is there any relation between anthropometric indices and decrease in seminal parameters?","abstract":"To investigate the influence of anthropometric indices on seminal parameters.Men who underwent treatment for conjugal infertility during the period of October, 2011, to March, 2012, were randomly selected. Patients with any prior diseases related to sperm alterations were excluded. Patients were submitted to an anthropometric evaluation to obtain body mass index, and the seminal analysis was made through a spermogram. Two anthropometric methods of classification were used: body mass index (normal and altered) and abdominal circumference (<94 cm and >94 cm). Data were analyzed by statistical tests.The group with the altered body mass index presented lower volumes of ejaculated volume and a larger percentage of patients with abdominal circumference <94 cm presented with progressive forms of spermatozoa below reference values. However, in the statistical tests, there was no significant difference.No significant difference was found in the sperm quality relative to the body mass index or abdominal circumference.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728248","annotations":[{"name":"Spermatozoon","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoon"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.560651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.551267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.51887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.391223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Semen quality","weight":0.287718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_quality"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.26108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.0658585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0478909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Ejaculation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Reference range","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_range"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
