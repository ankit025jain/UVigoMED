{"id":44625,"title":"Living donor liver transplantation in children: should the adult donor be operated on by an adult or pediatric surgeon? Experience of a single pediatric center.","abstract":"Living donor liver transplantation has become a cornerstone for the treatment of children with end-stage hepatic dysfunction, especially within populations or countries with low rates of organ utilization from deceased donors. The objective is to report our experience with 185 living donors operated on by a team pediatric surgeons in a tertiary center for pediatric liver transplantation.Retrospective analysis of medical records of donors of hepatic grafts for transplant undergoing surgery between June 1998 and March 2013.Over the last 14 years, 185 liver transplants were performed in pediatric recipients of grafts from living donors. Among the donors, 166 left lateral segments (89.7%), 18 left lobes without the caudate lobe (9.7%) and 1 right lobe (0.5%) were harvested. The donor age ranged from 16 to 53 years, and the weight ranged from 47 to 106 kg. In 10 donors, an additional graft of the donor inferior mesenteric vein was harvested to substitute for a hypoplastic recipient portal vein. The transfusion of blood products was required in 15 donors (8.1%). The mean hospital stay was 5 days. No deaths occurred, but complications were identified in 23 patients (12.4%): 9 patients experienced abdominal pain and severe gastrointestinal symptoms and 3 patients required reoperations. Eight donors presented with minor bile leaks that were treated conservatively, and 3 patients developed extra-peritoneal infections (1 wound collection, 1 phlebitis and 1 pneumonia). Eight grafts (4.3%) showed primary dysfunction resulting in recipient death (3 cases of fulminant hepatitis, 1 patient with metabolic disease, 1 patient with Alagille syndrome and 3 cases of biliary atresia in infants under 1 year old). There was no relation between donor complications and primary graft dysfunction (P=0.6).Living donor transplantation is safe for the donor and presents a low morbidity. The donor surgery may be performed by a team of trained pediatric surgeons.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System
