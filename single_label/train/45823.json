{"id":45823,"title":"Role of 6-shogaol in tert -butyl hydroperoxide-induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of 6-shogaol on tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced oxidative stress leading to apoptosis in human hepatoma cell line HepG2. The cells were exposed to tBHP (100 ?mol/l) after pretreatment with 6-shogaol (2.5 and 5 ?mol/l), and then cell viability was measured. 6-Shogaol fully prevented HepG2 cell death caused by tBHP. Treatment of tBHP resulted in apoptotic cell death as assessed by TUNEL assay and the expression of apoptosis regulator proteins, Bcl-2 family, caspases and cytochrome c. Cells treated with 6-shogaol showed rapid reduction of apoptosis by restoring these markers of apoptotic cells. In addition, 6-shogaol significantly recovered disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential as a start sign of hepatic apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. In line with this observation, antioxidative 6-shogaol inhibited generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of reduced glutathione in tBHP-stimulated HepG2 cells. Taken together, these results for the first time showed antioxidative and antiapoptotic activities of 6-shogaol in tBHP-treated hepatoma HepG2 cells, suggesting that 6-shogaol could be beneficial in hepatic disorders caused by oxidative stress.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662601","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Cytochrome c","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c"},{"name":"Membrane potential","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.752197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Mitochondrion","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Organic peroxide","weight":0.707902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_peroxide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.59269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.553623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.534725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.410164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Reactivity (chemistry)","weight":0.0832043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactivity_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"TUNEL assay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUNEL_assay"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"}]}
