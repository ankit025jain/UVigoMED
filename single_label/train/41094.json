{"id":41094,"title":"[Research on HBV DNA inhibition of plasmid acute infection mouse with betulinic acid].","abstract":"Betulinic acid is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid, which has antiretroviral, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties. The purpose of this study is to investigate the HBV DNA replication inhibition in the mouse model with betulinic acid. Hydrodynamic injection method via the tail vein with the Paywl. 3 plasmid was used to establish the animal mode (n = 15), and the mice were randomly divided into the PBS control group (n = 5), Betulinic acid treatment group (n = 5) and lamivudine control group (n = 5). The day after successful modeling , the mice would have taken Betulinic acid (100 mg x kg(-1)), lamivudine (50 mg x kg(-1)), PBS drugs orally, once daily for 7 days, blood samples were acquired from the orbital venous blood at 3, 5, 7 days after the administering, HBsAg and HBeAg in serum concentration were measured by ELISA and the mice were sacrificed after 7 days, HBV DNA southern detections were used with part of mice livers. The results showed that betulinic acid significantly inhibited the expression of HbsAg in the mice model at the fifth day compared with the control group, and there was no significant differences between the effects of lamivudine and the PBS control group; both the betulinic acid and lamivudine groups had no significant inhibition for the HBeAg expression; the HBV DNA expressions of the liver tissue from the betulinic acid and lamivudine groups were inhibited compared with the control group. Taken together, these results reveal betulinic acid can inhibit the HBsAg expression and replication of the liver HBV DNA in the mouse model.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956858","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.847604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.835475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.762749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.761965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.720071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.711684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.650147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.648965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.630405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.609575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.552062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Antimalarial medication","weight":0.54875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication"},{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.512041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.4206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.317447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.211585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Terpenoid","weight":0.107913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpenoid"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Tail","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Public Broadcasting Service","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Atomic orbital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Sacrifice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice"}]}
