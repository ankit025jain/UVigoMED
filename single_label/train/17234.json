{"id":17234,"title":"Experience of 1166 thyroidectomy without use of prophylactic antibiotic.","abstract":"Although the procedure requires a small surgical incision and a short duration, incision infection rate is very low in thyroidectomy; however, doctors still have misgivings about infection events.We retrospectively analyzed the prevention of incision infection without perioperative use of antibacterial medications following thyroidectomy.1166 patients of thyroidectomy were not administered perioperative antibiotics. Unilateral total lobectomy or partial thyroidectomy was performed in 68.0% patients with single-side nodular goiter or thyroid adenoma. Bilateral partial thyroidectomy was performed in 25.5% patients with nodular goiter or Graves' disease. The mean time of operation was 80.6 Â± 4.87 (range: 25-390) min.Resuturing was performed in two patients of secondary hemorrhage from residual thyroid following bilateral partial thyroidectomy. Temporally recurrent nerve paralysis was reported following right-side total lobectomy and left-side subtotal lobectomy in a nodular goiter patient. One case had suppurative infection in neck incision 5 days after bilateral partial thyroidectomy.Thyroidectomy, which is a clean incision, involves a small incision, short duration, and minor hemorrhage. If the operation is performed under strict conditions of sterility and hemostasis, antibacterial medications may not be required to prevent incision infection, which reduces cost and discourages the excessive use of antibiotics.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24900986","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.890082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Graves' disease","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graves'_disease"},{"name":"Goitre","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goitre"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.67938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.525027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.520985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.517882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.411933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.399023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.261224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Recurrent laryngeal nerve","weight":0.251011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.215792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.150134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Lobectomy","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobectomy"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Thyroid adenoma","weight":0.103079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_adenoma"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Hymenotomy","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenotomy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
