{"id":14020,"title":"Exercise-induced deep pectoral necrosis in white-headed pigeons (Columba leucomela).","abstract":"Abstract: Two white-headed pigeons (Columba leucomela) developed deep pectoral myopathy 2 days after vigorous exercise associated with capture. Clinical signs included lethargy and an inability to raise the wings above the head. Gross pathology consistently revealed marked pallor and edema of the supracoracoideus muscle, and histopathology revealed severe myofiber degeneration. A further two white-headed pigeons presented 7 and 21 days postexercise with similar lesions. Treatment with fluids, physiotherapy, and analgesia was unsuccessful. This is the first report of deep muscle necrosis in Columbiformes.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450059","annotations":[{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.79742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.763324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.742814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.643841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.578186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.568073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Rhabdomyolysis","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis"},{"name":"Pallor","weight":0.534913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Gross pathology","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_pathology"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Columbiformes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbiformes"},{"name":"White-headed Pigeon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-headed_Pigeon"},{"name":"Columba","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Columbidae","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae"},{"name":"Pectoralis major muscle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoralis_major_muscle"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"}]}
