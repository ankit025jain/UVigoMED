{"id":68606,"title":"Extended outcomes in the treatment of male stress urinary incontinence with a transobturator sling.","abstract":"To review extended patient outcomes after male transobturator sling placement for stress urinary incontinence.A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database for patients with at least 12 months of postoperative follow-up after AdVance male sling placement was performed. Success was defined as a dry safety pad or less (cured) or >50% improvement in pads used per day and patient satisfaction (improved). Patients requiring repeat continence procedures were considered failures.We reviewed data from 102 patients with a minimum of 12 months of follow-up (mean ± standard deviation 36.2 ± 16.5 months). The mean age at surgery was 66.1 years, and 86.4% had previously undergone a prostatectomy. At 12 months, 24 months, and final follow-up, success rates were 74%, 63%, and 62%, respectively. Although cure rates also declined over time, 40% of patients experienced a durable cure with no complaints of wet pads at final follow-up. Complications were minimal and similar with previous reports. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed detrusor overactivity and an elevated detrusor pressure and peak flow negatively predicted being cured using sling placement.AdVance sling placement continues to represent a viable option in the treatment of male stress incontinence. Although a decrease in efficacy over time was observed, a substantial portion of patients can expect a durable cure.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507897","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Prostatectomy","weight":0.333637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatectomy"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Stress incontinence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_incontinence"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Detrusor urinae muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrusor_urinae_muscle"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0172758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Bandage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage"},{"name":"Maxima and minima","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Peak expiratory flow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_expiratory_flow"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Deviance (sociology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_(sociology)"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"}]}
