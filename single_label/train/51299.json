{"id":51299,"title":"Involvement of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy deficits in the decline of ?-cell mass in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients.","abstract":"Deficits of ?-cells characterize the islet pathology in type 2 diabetes. It is yet to be clear how the ?-cell loss develops in type 2 diabetes. We explored the implication of oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-induced stress, and autophagy deficit in the ?-cell decline in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients.Pancreases from recent autopsy cases of 47 type 2 diabetic and 30 nondiabetic subjects were investigated on the islet structure with morphometric analysis. Volume densities of islet (Vi), ?-cell (V?), and ?-cell (V?) were measured. To evaluate cell damage of endocrine cells, immunohistochemical expressions of oxidative stress-related DNA damage as expressed by ?H2AX, ER stress-related cell damage as CCAAT/enhancer 1 binding protein-? (C/EBP-?), and autophagy deficit as P62 were semiquantified, and their correlations to islet changes were sought.Compared with nondiabetic subjects, V? was reduced in diabetic subjects. Contrariwise, there was an increase in V?. There was a significant link between reduced V? and increased HbA1c levels (P < 0.01) and a trend of inverse correlation between V? and duration of diabetes (P = 0.06). Expressions of ?H2AX, P62, and C/EBP-? were all enhanced in diabetic islets, and reduced V? correlated with the intensity of ?H2AX expression but not with C/EBP-? or P62 expressions. Combined expressions of ?H2AX, P62, and C/EBP-? were associated with severe reduction of V?.?-Cell deficit in type 2 diabetes was associated with increased oxidative stress and may further be augmented by autophagic deficits and ER stress.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705612","annotations":[{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.832399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.774535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.751006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.623819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.427071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.293075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.263432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cell damage","weight":0.234633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_damage"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Unfolded protein response","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfolded_protein_response"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Human enhancement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_enhancement"}]}
