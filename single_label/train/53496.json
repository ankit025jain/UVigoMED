{"id":53496,"title":"Repeated application of electroacupuncture ameliorates hyperglycemia in obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats.","abstract":"Electroacupuncture (EA) was investigated for lowering the blood glucose (BG) in fasting male obese Zucker fatty diabetic (ZDF) rats aged 10-17 weeks. Anesthesia provided satisfactory chemical restraint to enable repeated EA. Animals in Groups 1, 2 and 3 were anesthetized on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12. Group 1 (n = 4) received no EA (controls), Group 2 (n = 4) EA at Zhongwan and Guanyuan acupoints, and Group 3 (n = 4) EA at both Zusanli acupoints. BG was measured at 10 and 20 minutes, and EA was applied for 30 minutes, after which BG was measured again. Group 2 had a significantly lower baseline BG at 20 minutes on Days 5, 8 and 12 and significantly less change in BG over 30 minutes on Days 3 and 5 than Group 1 (p < 0.05). Group 3 showed a significant decrease in the mean baseline BG compared to Group 1 in Week 1 (p < 0.05). Thus, repeated EA using Zhongwan and Guanyuan acupoints was effective in lowering the baseline BG and modulating the change in the BG in anesthetized animals.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513342","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.694186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.568532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.44239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.364844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"ZDF","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZDF"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Bulgaria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"1017","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1017"},{"name":"Electronic Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Baseline (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"No. 1 Group RAF","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._1_Group_RAF"}]}
