{"id":37491,"title":"Anesthesia for craniofacial surgery in infancy.","abstract":"Anesthetic management of infants undergoing craniofacial surgery can be challenging. Primary concerns for the anesthesiologist include blood loss and its management. The evolution of procedures to treat craniosynostosis has resulted in improvements in perioperative morbidity, including decreased blood loss and transfusion, shorter operations, and shorter hospital stays. An understanding of the procedures performed to treat craniosynostosis is necessary to provide optimal anesthetic management. Descriptions of current surgical techniques and approaches to anesthetic care are presented in this review.
