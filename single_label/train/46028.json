{"id":46028,"title":"Detection and localization of bile duct leaks after cholecystectomy using Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR cholangiography: retrospective study of 16 patients.","abstract":"To determine if gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography can detect and localize bile duct leaks in postcholecystectomy patients.Four blinded independent radiologists performed a retrospective review of 16 consecutive patients who underwent MR cholangiography with intravenous Gd-EOB-DTPA for the evaluation of possible biliary leak. Image quality, ductal opacification, and presence and location of any bile leak were evaluated. An independent observer determined the criterion standard using a consensus of all chart, clinical, and imaging findings.All 6 bile leaks confirmed at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were diagnosed by all reviewers (sensitivity, 100%). Of the 10 patients with no leak, only one reader incorrectly diagnosed a bile leak in a single case (specificity, 98%). The accuracy for detection of the site of leak with Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR cholangiography was 80%.Gadolinium-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR can detect bile leaks with a high sensitivity and specificity.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651750","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.775158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.698873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.470553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.338071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.0362886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Imaging science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_science"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"News leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_leak"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Cholangiography","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiography"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"}]}
