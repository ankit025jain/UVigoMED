{"id":34244,"title":"The timing of surgical ligation for patent ductus arteriosus is associated with neonatal morbidity in extremely preterm infants born at 23-25 weeks of gestation.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate prognostic factors associated with surgical ligation for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in extremely preterm infants born at the limits of viability. Ninety infants who were born at 23-25 weeks of gestation and who received surgical ligation were included and their cases were retrospectively reviewed. Infants were classified into two different groups: survivors with no major morbidity (N), and non-survivors or survivors with any major morbidity (M). Clinical characteristics were compared between the groups. Possible prognostic factors were derived from this comparison and further tested by logistic regression analysis. The mean gestational age and the mean birth weight of M were significantly lower than those of N. Notably, the mean postnatal age at time of ligation in N was significantly later than that of the other group (17 ± 12 vs 11 ± 8 days in N and M, respectively). An adjusted analysis showed that delayed ligation (>2 weeks) was uniquely associated with a significantly decreased risk for mortality or composite morbidity after surgical ligation (OR, 0.105; 95% CI, 0.012-0.928). In conclusion, delayed surgical ligation for PDA (>2 weeks) is associated with decreased mortality or morbidities in extremely preterm infants born at 23-25 weeks of gestation.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24753708","annotations":[{"name":"Patent ductus arteriosus","weight":0.914023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Ductus arteriosus","weight":0.73384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.72649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.691365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.688483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.663186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.595466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.264836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Fetal viability","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability"},{"name":"Personal digital assistant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Duct (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Uncial 0120","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0120"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Group 17","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_17"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"}]}
