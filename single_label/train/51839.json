{"id":51839,"title":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1? enhances local estrogen biosynthesis by stimulating aromatase activity in endometriosis.","abstract":"Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease, and estrogen is overproduced by abnormally elevated aromatase in endometriotic tissues. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1? (PGC-1?) is a transcriptional coactivator-modulating steroid hormone.To investigate the effect of PGC-1? on aromatase activity in endometriosis.Specimens from ovarian endometrioma (OE), endometrium with endometriosis (EE), and normal endometrium (NE) were analyzed for PGC-1? and aromatase expression. PGC-1?-dependent changes in aromatase expression in primary cultured stromal cells (SCs) were identified using luciferase and enzymatic assays, exon I-specific RT-PCR, and real-time PCR. Environmental stimulus-induced changes in PGC-1? were also examined.PGC-1? was more highly expressed in OE than in EE and NE (P < .01). In OE, PGC-1? was coexpressed with aromatase, and their mRNA expressions were also correlated (r = 0.56, P = .02). PGC-1? was recruited to the nuclear receptor half-site between PI.3 and PII in the aromatase promoter. PGC-1? overexpression enhanced aromatase promoter activity (P < .01), mRNA expression (P < .05), and enzymatic activity (P < .01) in SCs from OE, but not in SCs from EE or NE. The levels of PI.3, PII, and exon II mRNA increased and transcriptional enhancement was abolished by mutation of the PGC-1?-interacting site. PGC-1? expression was enhanced in SCs from OE by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-? (P < .05) but not by hypoxia or 17?-estradiol.PGC-1? stimulated by TNF-? regulates aromatase expression and activity to promote local estrogen biosynthesis in OE, suggesting that PGC-1? is a promising candidate for novel targeted therapies in endometriosis treatment.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654751","annotations":[{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.947293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"Peroxisome","weight":0.895008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Exon","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Steroid hormone","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_hormone"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.822386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.764874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Biosynthesis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Coactivator (genetics)","weight":0.665677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coactivator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.636922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.604378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Aromatase","weight":0.490359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.489279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.352428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.305582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.227665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Environment (biophysical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_(biophysical)"}]}
