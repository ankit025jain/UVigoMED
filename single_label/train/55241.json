{"id":55241,"title":"Orbicularis oculi muscle transposition for repairing involutional lower eyelid entropion.","abstract":"To describe a simple technique for involutional entropion correction and to present the findings of a retrospective interventional case series study.We studied a consecutive series of 414 patients (609 eyelids). Patients presenting with involutional entropion in the absence of lateral canthal tendon laxity underwent orbicularis oculi muscle (OOM) transposition from pretarsal position to corresponding preseptum without horizontal shortening or resection of the orbicularis muscle.Immediate resolution of entropion and associated ocular symptoms was achieved in 607 eyelids (99.67 %). An early postoperative complication was localized lid swelling that gradually subsided within one week. Over-correction occurred in six cases and resolved with pressure dressing, mostly one or two days post-operation. At final follow-up, a significant improvement in eyelid position was achieved in 579 eyelids (95.07 % ). There was mild recurrence of entropion in 30 eyelids (4.93 %). The mean follow-up was 6.84 months (range, 6-12 months).Orbicularis oculi muscle transposition is a reasonably successful procedure with a high success rate, and is particularly suitable for patients for whom there exits overriding of the preseptal OOM over the pretarsal OOM.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947549","annotations":[{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.615721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.587161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Entropion","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.226841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Orbicularis oculi muscle","weight":0.200301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oculi_muscle"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Canthus","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canthus"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"414","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/414"},{"name":"Angular resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_resolution"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Order of Merit of the Police Forces","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Merit_of_the_Police_Forces"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Involution (mathematics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Oculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus"},{"name":"Transposon","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon"}]}
