{"id":33352,"title":"Total body polyethylene wraps for preventing hypothermia in preterm infants: a randomized trial.","abstract":"To evaluate whether a polyethylene total body wrapping (covering both the body and head) is more effective than conventional treatment (covering up to the shoulders) in reducing perinatal thermal losses in very preterm infants.This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, parallel 1:1, unblinded, controlled trial of infants<29 weeks' gestation age, comprising two study groups: experimental group (total body group; both the body and head covered with a polyethylene occlusive bag, with the face uncovered) and control group (only the body, up to the shoulders, covered with a polyethylene occlusive bag). The primary outcome was axillary temperature on neonatal intensive care unit admission immediately after wrap removal.One hundred randomly allocated infants (50 in the total body group and 50 controls) completed the study. Mean axillary temperature on neonatal intensive care unit admission was similar in the two groups (36.5±0.6°C total body vs 36.4±0.8°C controls; P=.53). The rate of moderate hypothermia (temperature<36°C) was 12% in the total body group and 20% in the control group (P=.41). Three subjects in each group (6.0%) had an axillary temperature>37.5°C on admission, and one subject in control group had an axillary temperature>38°C.Total body wrapping is comparable with covering the body up to the shoulders in preventing postnatal thermal losses in very preterm infants.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837862","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.889576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.695533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Neonatal intensive care unit","weight":0.677797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.57761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.521577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.423819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.341581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Mud wrap","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_wrap"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Plosive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Kippah","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Digital Transmission Content Protection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Transmission_Content_Protection"},{"name":"Sandwich wrap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_wrap"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Alfa Romeo 6C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_6C"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Group 6 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_6_element"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
