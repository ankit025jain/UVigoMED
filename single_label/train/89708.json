{"id":89708,"title":"Masquelet technique for treatment of posttraumatic bone defects.","abstract":"Masquelet technique, which is the use of a temporary cement spacer followed by staged bone grafting, is a recent treatment strategy to manage a posttraumatic bone defect. This paper describes a series of 9 patients treated with this technique of staged bone grafting following placement of an antibiotic spacer to successfully manage osseous long bone defects. The injured limbs were stabilized and aligned at the time of initial spacer placement. In our series, osseous consolidation was successfully achieved in all cases. This technique gives promising result in the management of posttraumatic bone defects.
