{"id":61667,"title":"Expression of cereblon protein assessed by immunohistochemicalstaining in myeloma cells is associated with superior response of thalidomide- and lenalidomide-based treatment, but not bortezomib-based treatment, in patients with multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Cereblon (CRBN) is essential for the anti-myeloma (MM) activity of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), such as thalidomide and lenalidomide. However, the clinical implications of CRBN in MM patients are unclear. Using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining on paraffin-embedded bone marrow sections, the expression of CRBN protein in myeloma cells (MCs) was assessed in 40 relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) patients who received lenalidomide/dexamethasone (LD) and 45 and 22 newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients who received thalidomide/dexamethasone (TD) and melphalan/bortezomib/prednisolone (MVP), respectively. IHC staining were scored on a scale representing the diffuseness and intensity of positive-staining MCs (range, 0-8) and a score ?4.5 was used for CRBN positivity (CRBN(+)) on a cut-point analysis of all possible scores and response of TD and LD. Compared to CRBN(+) NDMM patients, CRBN(-) NDMM patients had more international staging system (ISS) III (26 vs. 61 %, respectively; P = 0.006). In the LD and TD cohorts, the response rate (RR) was higher in CRBN(+) patients than CRBN(-) patients (LD 79 vs. 33 %, respectively; P = 0.005) (TD 75 vs. 29 %, respectively; P = 0.005); however, this trend was not observed in the MVP cohort. In the LD and TD cohorts, the positive and negative prediction value of CRBN(+) for treatment response was 79 and 67 % and 75 and 71 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that CRBN(+) was a significant factor associated with superior RR for LD and TD. The data suggest that expression of CRBN protein in MCs assessed using the IHC is a feasible approach to predict the response of IMiDs in MM patients.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687382","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.894979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Thalidomide","weight":0.86916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.666097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.652683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.575564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.437794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.421841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.300195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Territorial Decoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Decoration"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Most Valuable Player","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Valuable_Player"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
