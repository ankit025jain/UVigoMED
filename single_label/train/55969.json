{"id":55969,"title":"Two-year clinical experience with the CyPass micro-stent: safety and surgical outcomes of a novel supraciliary micro-stent.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate through 2 postoperative years the clinical outcomes associated with a novel supraciliary micro-stent for the surgical treatment of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) when implanted in conjunction with cataract surgery.In a multicenter, prospective, consecutive case series, 136 subjects (136 eyes) with OAG and requiring cataract surgery with 24-month postoperative data were included. A combined phacoemulsification procedure, with intraocular lens insertion and CyPass Micro-Stent implantation into the supraciliary space of the study eye, was performed. At baseline, all subjects were on glaucoma medication with either uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP; ? 21 mmHg, Cohort 1, n=51) or controlled IOP (<21 mmHg, Cohort 2, n=85). Glaucoma medications were stopped postoperatively, but could be restarted if needed, at the investigator's discretion. Device-related adverse events, postoperative IOP, best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), and number of IOP-lowering medications were recorded.The micro-stent was successfully implanted in all eyes. At 24 months, 82 subjects remained in the study. No sight-threatening adverse events occurred. The most common adverse events were transient hypotony (15.4%) and micro-stent obstruction (8.8%), typically due to iris tissue overgrowth. Fifteen subjects (11%) required secondary incisional glaucoma surgery. For Cohort 1 (n=23), mean ± SD IOP was 15.8 ± 3.8 mmHg after 24 months (change, -37% ± 19%). Mean IOP decrease from baseline was statistically significant (p<0.0001) at months 6, 12, and 24. For Cohort 2 (n=59), mean ± SD IOP at 24 months was 16.1 ± 3.2 mmHg (change, 0% ± 28%). Mean decrease from baseline was statistically significant at months 6 (p=0.0188) and 12 (p=0.0356). At 24 months, the mean ± SD number of medications was 1.0 ± 1.1 in Cohort 1 and 1.1 ± 1.1 in Cohort 2. Mean decrease from baseline medication use was statistically significant at months 6 (p<0.001), 12 (p<0.001), and 24 (p=0.0265) in Cohort 1, and at months 6, 12, and 24 (all p<0.0001) in Cohort 2.CyPass Micro-Stent implantation, in combination with cataract surgery, was associated with minimal complications while substantially lowering IOP and/or use of IOP-lowering medications.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771171","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.791621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.73043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.718362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.710712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.648341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.63455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.604378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.412055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.404832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.395147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.172474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.156094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Outer space","weight":0.120007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Glaucoma surgery","weight":0.016711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma_surgery"}]}
