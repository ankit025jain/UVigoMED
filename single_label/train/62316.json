{"id":62316,"title":"Reduced intensity conditioning, combined transplantation of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells in patients with severe aplastic anemia.","abstract":"We examined if transplantation of combined haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) affected graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Patients with SAA-I (N?=?17) received haploidentical HSCT plus MSC infusion. Stem cell grafts used a combination of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-primed bone marrow and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells of haploidentical donors and the culture-expanded third-party donor-derived umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs), respectively. Reduced intensity conditioning consisted of fludarabine (30 mg/m2·d)+cyclosphamide (500 mg/m2·d)+anti-human thymocyte IgG. Transplant recipients also received cyclosporin A, mycophenolatemofetil, and CD25 monoclonal antibody. A total of 16 patients achieved hematopoietic reconstitution. The median mononuclear cell and CD34 count was 9.3×10(8)/kg and 4.5×10(6)/kg. Median time to ANC was >0.5×10(9)/L and PLT count >20×10(9)/L were 12 and 14 days, respectively. Grade III-IV acute GVHD was seen in 23.5% of the cases, while moderate and severe chronic GVHD were seen in 14.2% of the cases. The 3-month and 6-month survival rates for all patients were 88.2% and 76.5%, respectively; mean survival time was 56.5 months. Combined transplantation of haploidentical HSCs and MSCs on SAA without an HLA-identical sibling donor was safe, effectively reduced the incidence of severe GVHD, and improved patient survival.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594618","annotations":[{"name":"Aplastic anemia","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplastic_anemia"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Thymocyte","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymocyte"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.861929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Fludarabine","weight":0.838272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludarabine"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.75953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.737178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Peripheral stem cell transplantation","weight":0.527551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.518059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.45351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"CD25","weight":0.347629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD25"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.288635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.067811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Word stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"}]}
