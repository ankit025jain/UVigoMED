{"id":67986,"title":"Pattern of reproductive cancers in India.","abstract":"Reproductive cancers are those that affect the human organs that are involved in producing offspring. An attempt is made in the present communication to assess the magnitude and pattern of reproductive cancers, including their treatment modalities, in India. The cancer incidence data related to reproductive cancers collected by five population-based urban registries, namely Bangalore, Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai, for the years 2006-08 were utilized. The reproductive cancers among females constituted around 25% of the total and around 9% among males. Among females, the three major contributors were cervix (55.5%), ovary (26.1%) and corpus uteri (12.4%). Similarly among males, the three major contributors were prostate (77.6%), penis (11.6%) and testis (10.5%). For females, the AAR of reproductive cancers varied between 30.5 in the registry of Mumbai to 37.3 in the registry of Delhi. In males, it ranged between 6.5 in the registry of Bhopal to 14.7 in the registry of Delhi. For both males and females, the individual reproductive cancer sites showed increasing trends with age. The leading treatment provided was: radio-therapy in combination with chemo-therapy for cancers of cervix (48.3%) and vagina (43.9%); surgery in combination with chemo-therapy (54.9%) for ovarian cancer; and surgery in combination with radio-therapy for the cancers of the corpus uteri (39.8%). In males, the leading treatment provided was hormone-therapy for prostate cancer (39.6%), surgery for penile cancer (81.3%) and surgery in combination with chemo-therapy for cancer of the testis (57.6%).","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568464","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.84024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Carcinoma of the penis","weight":0.805736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma_of_the_penis"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.729197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"India","weight":0.660555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.575714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.558165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.538188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mumbai","weight":0.4412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai"},{"name":"Chennai","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Bangalore","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore"},{"name":"Delhi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi"},{"name":"Text corpus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
