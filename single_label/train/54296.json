{"id":54296,"title":"Outcome of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in diabetic patients with critical limb ischaemia.","abstract":"We investigated the clinical outcome of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) which has not been fully established in diabetic patients with critical limb Ischaemia (CLI) compared with non-diabetics.A total of 73 limbs of 52 patients (50 limbs of 34 diabetic patients and 23 limbs of 18 non-diabetics) who underwent PTA for CLI (Rutherford-Becker category 4, 5 or 6) were enrolled. Rates of amputation and restenosis, and ankle brachial index (ABI), were assessed before and after PTA during a 36-month follow-up period.Diabetic patients had a higher rate of major amputations after PTA (10 vs. 0%, P<0.05); however, total amputation (12.0 vs. 8.7%, P=0.62) and restenosis rates (4.0 vs. 8.7%, P=0.38) were not significantly different compared with non-diabetic patients. ABI at 3 months after PTA was significantly improved in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients (0.70±0.20 vs. 0.93±0.19, P<0.01 in diabetic patients; 0.69±0.25 vs. 0.92±0.17, P<0.01 in non-diabetics). Improved ABI was maintained for 36 months in both groups and did not show a significant difference (0.88±0.21 vs. 0.89±0.20, P=0.89).Our results, showing that the outcome of PTA in diabetic patients is not inferior to that in non-diabetics, suggest the potential benefit of primary PTA, instead of bypass surgery, for CLI in diabetic patients who are at high risk of perioperative complications.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464598","annotations":[{"name":"Angioplasty","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angioplasty"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.775615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.728095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.646945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Restenosis","weight":0.561754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restenosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Brachial artery","weight":0.328674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_artery"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"1 decimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decimetre"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"930","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/930"},{"name":"880","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/880"},{"name":"920","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/920"},{"name":"890","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/890"},{"name":"Index finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_finger"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale"},{"name":"Application binary interface","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"},{"name":"Parent-Teacher Association","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent-Teacher_Association"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Rates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rates"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
