{"id":47691,"title":"Recurrent lymphocytic myocarditis in a young male with ulcerative colitis.","abstract":"Awareness of myocarditis in association with inflammatory bowel diseases is crucial as it bears a rare but serious risk for mortality. This report describes the case of a young Caucasian male, whose heart biopsy was tested negative for giant cells and bacterial or viral genomes or proteins. He was experiencing severe lymphocytic myocarditis (other than mesalamine-induced) along with cardiogenic shock during ulcerative colitis exacerbation. This is an extremely rare, if not unique, clinical constellation. We chose to study the epidemiologic grounds and all major aspects of differential pathogenesis and treatment of this serious health problem.
