{"id":4271,"title":"[Occupational health risk assessment for workers in pipe rolling production].","abstract":"Certification of workplaces, monitoring of work conditions, information on number and occupational morbidity in 42 occupations at 10 occupational areas in pipe rolling workshop helped to evaluate occupational risk for the workers' health. Prior estimate based on integral evaluation of work conditions revealed 5 risk categories--from minor to extremely high. Unbearable occupational risk was determined mostly by the workers' exposure to occupational noise. The occupations of extremely high risk were characterized by prevalent exposure to one of the factors corresponding to class 4, and by combined exposure to several factors with high hazard degree with working conditions classes 3.4-4. Posterior estimate demonstrated occupations with proven risk of neurosensory deafness and registered medium occupational risk of dust diseases. In the course of occupational risk evaluation, the authors revealed the occupations necessitating complex programs and specific measures to lower occupational risk.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282809","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.528154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.485085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.480187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.468485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.168905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Certification","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification"},{"name":"Industrial noise","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_noise"},{"name":"Dust","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0474663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Health risk assessment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_risk_assessment"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Yosemite Decimal System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_Decimal_System"},{"name":"Workshop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop"},{"name":"Pipe (fluid conveyance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_(fluid_conveyance)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"}]}
