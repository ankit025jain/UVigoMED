{"id":84088,"title":"[Functions of lncRNA in development and diseases].","abstract":"The transcription of essentially the entire eukaryotic genome generates a myriad of non-coding RNA species that show complex overlapping patterns of expression and regulation. In the last decade, several large scale genomic analyses have shed light on the widespread existence of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammals. Although the function of most lncRNAs remains unknown, many of them have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression during normal development and diseases, including cancers. Indeed, functional studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs participate in various biological processes, including reprogramming of pluripotent stem cells, oncogenic progression and cell cycle regulation. In this review, we summarize recent findings about the biology of lncRNAs and their functions in normal and pathological development in mammals.
