{"id":5092,"title":"[Case-control study on the treatment of humerus supracondylar fracture of Gartland III in children by manipulative reduction and Kirschner wire percataneous internal fixation].","abstract":"To study the clinical effect of the Gartland III humerus supracondylar fractures in children by manipulative reduction and Kirschner wire percataneous internal fixation.From July 2010 and July 2013, 60 patients with Gartland III humerus supracondylar fracture were selected and divided into treatment group and control group. In the treatment group 32 patients were treated with traditional bone setting tetradeca-manipulative reduction and percataneous Kirschner wire internal fixation,included 18 males and 14 females with an average age of (7.8 +/- 2.7) years old ranging from 5 to 11; in the control group 28 patients were treated with open reduction and Kirschner wire internal fixation,included 16 males and 12 females with an average age of (7.2 +/- 3.0) years old ranging from 4 to 12. The motion range of the elbow joint,the time of fracture clinical healing, and the effect after 6 months of Flynm clinical functional assessment standards were observed and compared.The average fracture healing time of the control group (5.01 +/- 0.43) weeks was longer than that of the treatment group (4.29 +/- 0.29) weeks (t = 7.49, P = 0.00). At 6 months after treatment,the elbow motion range of the treatment group (146.02 +/- 2.28) was more than that of the control group (140.76 +/- 4.42) (t = -5.67, P = 0.00). At 6 months after treatment, according to Flynn evaluation, in the control group,there were 7 cases as excellent, 16 as good, 4 fair, 1 poor; in the treatment group, excellent in 21, good in 9, fair in 2 (U = 3.09, P = 0.002).Manipulative reduction and Kirschner wire percataneous internal fixation for treatment of children's Gartland III humerus condyle fractures can shorten fracture clinical healing time and the clinical curative effect is better.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25338446","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.605816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.311421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.291689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Supracondylar fracture","weight":0.279879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supracondylar_fracture"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.114562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.113019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Kirschner wire","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirschner_wire"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Marc Kirschner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Kirschner"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"},{"name":"Group 5 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_5_element"},{"name":"Buffy vs. Dracula","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_vs._Dracula"},{"name":"Bonesetter","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonesetter"}]}
