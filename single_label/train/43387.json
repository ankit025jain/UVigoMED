{"id":43387,"title":"Let-7 g microRNA sensitizes fluorouracil-resistant human hepatoma cells.","abstract":"Let-7 microRNA is expressed in lower lever in a variety of human tumors and is involved in tumorigenesis. This study investigated the inhibitory effect of the let-7g microRNA on the expression of the HMGA2 gene in the fluorouracil (5-Fu)-resistant human hepatoma cell line Bel-7402/5-Fu, and the effect of let-7 g microRNA on drug sensitization in Bel-7402/5-Fu cells. Let-7 g microRNA and negative microRNA plasmids were constructed and transient transfected into Bel-7402/5-Fu cells. Expression levels of HMGA2 mRNA and protein in microRNA transient transfectants were clearly reduced as compared with negative microRNA transfectants and untreated cells. Flow cytometry revealed increased in S phase in let-7 g microRNA cells. dimethylthiazol-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) results indicated that microRNA transfectants had a higher cell inhibition rate than the negative vector or untreated cells after treatment with 0.13-13 microg/ml 5-Fu. In addition, cyclin A was down-regulated in the let-7 g transfectants cells.The results showed that let-7 g microRNA contributed to an increase of 5-Fu-induced cell cycle inhibit in human hepatoma cell and sensitized cells to 5-Fu, leading to increased the effectiveness of the drug in treating hepatoma cancer.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791593","annotations":[{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"S phase","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_phase"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.677728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.413135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Cyclin A","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_A"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.307594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.1865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"HMGA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGA"},{"name":"HMGA2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMGA2"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Bromide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide"}]}
