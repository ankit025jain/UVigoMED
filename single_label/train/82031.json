{"id":82031,"title":"Young patients' perception on different surgical management of the disto-occlusal gingival operculum in second mandibular molars.","abstract":"This baseline study aims to find out the young patients' perception on different surgical management of the disto-oclusal gingival operculum in second mandibular molars: the conventional technique and the laser assisted one.The current study included a batch of 20 patients who needed surgical bilateral removal of the disto-oclusal operculum in second mandibular molars order for them to receive conservative treatment. Each patient benefited of two different surgical techniques (laser assisted and conventional). Patients' perception towards these procedures was evaluated with a simple questionnaire.The questionnaires were evaluated by a specialized team and the results were illustrated in the specific charts. On one hand the conventional technique wasn't perceived as very comfortable and on the other hand the laser assisted technique was very well perceived by the patients.The overall perception of young patients towards laser assisted periodontal surgery was very high and this is a means of reducing operating time and anxiety caused by the surgery itself.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741799","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.595466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.474686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.370331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.362769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.267602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.155994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.138691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Operculum (gastropod)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operculum_(gastropod)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"}]}
