{"id":51657,"title":"Phase II study of treatment of advanced ovarian cancer with folate-receptor-targeted therapeutic (vintafolide) and companion SPECT-based imaging agent (99mTc-etarfolatide).","abstract":"This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide).In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%), and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide uptake.Forty-nine patients were enrolled; 43 were available for analysis. One hundred thirty-nine lesions were (99m)Tc-etarfolatide evaluable: 110 FR positive and 29 FR negative. Lesion disease control rate (DCR = stable or response) was observed in 56.4% of FR-positive lesions versus 20.7% of FR-negative lesions (P < 0.001). Patient DCR was 57%, 36%, and 33% in FR(100%), FR(10%-90%), and FR(0%) patients, respectively. Median overall survival was 14.6, 9.6, and 3.0 months in FR(100%), FR(10%-90%), and FR(0%) patients, respectively.Overall response to FR-targeted therapy and DCR correlate with FR positivity demonstrated by (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667717","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.809809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.541541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.4505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.304844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Pet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
