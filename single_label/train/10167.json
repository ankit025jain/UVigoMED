{"id":10167,"title":"Endoplasmic reticulum stress is accompanied by activation of NF-?B in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","abstract":"Recent studies have indicated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ER stress occurs when the ER-mitochondria calcium cycle is disturbed and misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. To cope with ER stress, cells activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Accumulating evidence from non-neuronal cell models suggests that there is extensive cross-talk between the UPR and the NF-?B pathway.Here we investigated the expression of NF-?B and the main UPR markers X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), basic leucine-zipper transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor-2? (p-eIF2) in mutated SOD1(G93A) cell models of ALS, as well as their modulation by lipopolysaccharide and ER-stressing (tunicamycin) stimuli.Expression of NF-?B was enhanced in the presence of SOD1(G93A). Lipopolysaccharide did not induce the UPR in NSC34 cells and motor neurons in a mixed motor neuron-glia coculture system. The induction of the UPR by tunicamycin was accompanied by activation of NF-?B in NSC34 cells and motor neurons.Our data linked two important pathogenic mechanisms of ALS, ER stress and NF-?B signalling, in motor neurons.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666819","annotations":[{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Lipopolysaccharide","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.860982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Eukaryote","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.796571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.646244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.599018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Eukaryotic initiation factor","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_initiation_factor"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.496142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"XBP1","weight":0.435257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBP1"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.402995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.141581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Crosstalk (biology)","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Initiation factor","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation_factor"},{"name":"Unfolded protein response","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfolded_protein_response"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"}]}
