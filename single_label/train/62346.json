{"id":62346,"title":"Multisystemic Langerhans cell histiocytosis mimicking diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis.","abstract":"We report the first case of multisystemic Langerhans cell histiocytes mimicking diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis clinically. This has been described in patients with congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis but not in patients with acute, disseminated, and multisystemic disease. In our experience, dermoscopic findings did not help to diagnose the condition.
