{"id":18461,"title":"Use of bacteriophage cell wall-binding proteins for rapid diagnostics of Listeria.","abstract":"Diagnostic protocols for food-borne bacterial pathogens such as Listeria need to be sensitive, specific, rapid, and inexpensive. Conventional culture methods are hampered by lengthy enrichment and incubation steps. Bacteriophage-derived high-affinity binding molecules (cell wall-binding domains, CBDs) specific for Listeria cells have recently been introduced as tools for detection and differentiation of this pathogen in foods. When coupled with magnetic separation, these proteins offer advantages in sensitivity and speed compared to the standard diagnostic methods. Furthermore, fusion of CBDs to differently colored fluorescent reporter proteins enables differentiation of Listeria strains in mixed cultures. This chapter provides protocols for detection of Listeria in food by CBD-based magnetic separation and subsequent multiplexed identification of strains of different serotypes with reporter-CBD fusion proteins.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792555","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacteriophage","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.766704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.661401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.455229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.276854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.153297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0642765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Listeria","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Speed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed"},{"name":"Reporter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter"},{"name":"Separation process","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_process"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Mineral processing","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_processing"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Central business district","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district"},{"name":"Avian incubation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation"},{"name":"Chapter (religion)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_(religion)"}]}
