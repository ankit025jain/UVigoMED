{"id":89764,"title":"[The choice of interface in negative pressure treatments].","abstract":"The treatment of wounds by negative pressure requires the use of a foam or gauze interface. The study of scientific articles on the subject shows that the quality of the formation of granulation tissue and the pain during dressing removal differ depending on the technique, in favour of the use of the compress. On the other hand, no difference is found in terms of drainage capacity or the intensity of vascularisation.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683856","annotations":[{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.754899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.469426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Gauze","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauze"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0994293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0672669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Foam","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam"},{"name":"Granulation tissue","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue"},{"name":"Compression (physical)","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physical)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"User interface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"}]}
