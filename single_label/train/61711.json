{"id":61711,"title":"[Bone and Stem Cells. Regulation of hematopoietic microenvironment by bone metabolism].","abstract":"The skeletal and the hematopoietic systems are two different research lines being united through the definition of a new function of bone-forming-osteoblasts, as a regulatory niche for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) . Many molecular pathways reveal the interaction between the HSC and osteoblast contributory to the maintenance of HSC number and function. Factors that regulate osteoblastic niche from surrounding tissues are also known, such as sympathetic nervous system, macrophages, and osteocytes. Furthermore, recent study has revealed that the skeletal system regulates remote hematopoietic organ as well. The bone acts as a central regulator of multiple organs.
