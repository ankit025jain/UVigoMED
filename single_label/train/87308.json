{"id":87308,"title":"[The new working classification of blood stain patterns].","abstract":"The results of analysis of the existing classifications of blood stain patterns indicate that systematization of the morphological characteristics of blood stains requires that mechanisms and circumstances of the injury, properties of the surfaces receiving blood stains and the objects leaving them should be taken into consideration. The new working classification of blood stain patterns has been developed for the purposes of forensic medical expertise satisfying the above requirements. It makes it possible to pass to the next stage of research on systematization of the general and specific morphological features of blood stains depending on concrete circumstances of bodily injuries.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275177","annotations":[{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.396419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.163318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Concrete","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Bloodstain pattern analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodstain_pattern_analysis"},{"name":"Medical jurisprudence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_jurisprudence"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0138709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
