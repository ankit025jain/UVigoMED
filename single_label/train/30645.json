{"id":30645,"title":"[Analysis of questionably allergic factors to parenterally administered shenmai--a nested case control study using hospital information system data].","abstract":"Parenterally administered Shenmai, made from constituents of Ginseng Rubra Radix and Ophiopogonis Radix has, confirmed by modem pharmacological studies, the function of increasing cardiac hypoxia tolerance and anti arrhythmic and antibacterial properties. However, parenterally administered Shenmai is also prone to cause allergic reactions, which is clearly a safety issue. NCCSs combine elements from case-control and cohort studies. HIS data provides real world clinical information on the use of parenterally administered Shenmai. To explore suspected allergic factors this article compares specific information of those who showed allergies to those who didnt in the real world clinical application based on HIS data from 20 nationwide hospitals. Data includes age, gender, severity and type of allergic response, dosage, solvents used in the medication's preparation and drugs used in combination with parenterally administered Shenmai. Whilst this methodology is a possible route of exploration, ultimately pharmaceutical experiments and prospective clinical studies are required to identify and confirm factors related to allergic reactions.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471323","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.688756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.510032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.497639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Case-control study","weight":0.434575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.242983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ginseng","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginseng"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.213206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Information system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
