{"id":84962,"title":"Multiple variations of the superficial jugular veins: case report and clinical relevance.","abstract":"The jugular venous system constitutes the primary venous drainage of the head and neck. It includes a profundus or subfascial venous system, formed by the two internal jugular veins, and a superficial or subcutaneous one, formed by the two anterior and two external jugular veins. We report one case of unilateral anatomical variations of the external and anterior jugular veins. Particularly, on the right side, three external jugular veins co-existed with two anterior jugular veins. Such a combination of venous anomalies is extremely rare. The awareness of the variability of these veins is essential to anesthesiologists and radiologists, since the external jugular vein constitutes a common route for catheterization. Their knowledge is also important to surgeons performing head and neck surgery.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25006662","annotations":[{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.769557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Internal jugular vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_jugular_vein"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.716536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.523993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.314783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"External jugular vein","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_jugular_vein"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Anterior jugular vein","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_jugular_vein"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Head and neck anatomy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_anatomy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Flexor digitorum profundus muscle","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_digitorum_profundus_muscle"}]}
