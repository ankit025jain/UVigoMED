{"id":79546,"title":"SHP-1 plays a crucial role in CD40 signaling reciprocity.","abstract":"CD40 plays dual immunoregulatory roles in Leishmania major infection and tumor regression. The functional duality emerges from CD40-induced reciprocal p38MAPK and ERK-1/2 phosphorylations. Because phosphotyrosine-based signaling in hematopoietic cells is regulated by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which is not implied in CD40 signaling, we examined whether SHP-1 played any roles in CD40-induced reciprocal signaling and anti-leishmanial function. We observed that a weaker CD40 stimulation increased SHP-1 activation. ERK-1/2 inhibition or p38MAPK overexpression inhibited CD40-induced SHP-1 activation. An ultra-low-dose, CD40-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation was enhanced by SHP-1 inhibition but reduced by SHP-1 overexpression. A reverse profile was observed with ERK-1/2 phosphorylation. SHP-1 inhibition reduced syk phosphorylation but increased lyn phosphorylation; syk inhibition reduced but lyn inhibition enhanced CD40-induced SHP-1 phosphorylation. Corroborating these findings, in L. major-infected macrophages, CD40-induced SHP-1 phosphorylation increased and SHP-1 inhibition enhanced CD40-induced p38MAPK activation and inducible NO synthase expression. IL-10 enhanced SHP-1 phosphorylation and CD40-induced ERK-1/2 phosphorylation but reduced the CD40-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation, whereas anti-IL-10 Ab exhibited reverse effects on these CD40-induced functions, identifying IL-10 as a crucial element in the SHP-1-MAPK feedback system. Lentivirally overexpressed SHP-1 rendered resistant C57BL/6 mice susceptible to the infection. Lentivirally expressed SHP-1 short hairpin RNA enhanced the CD40-induced L. major parasite killing in susceptible BALB/c mice. Thus, we establish an SHP-1-centered feedback system wherein SHP-1 modulates CD40-induced p38MAPK activation threshold and reciprocal ERK-1/2 activation, establishing itself as a critical regulator of CD40 signaling reciprocity and mechanistically re-emphasizing its role as a potential target against the diseases where CD40 is involved.
