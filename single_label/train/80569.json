{"id":80569,"title":"A rare cause of asymptomatic solitary pulmonary nodule: adult Schistosoma worm.","abstract":"Solitary pulmonary nodule due to various pathologies has been reported in the medical literature. We report a case of solitary pulmonary nodule in an asymptomatic 60-year-old male smoker, who had a positive family history of pulmonary tuberculosis. His routine screening chest X-ray revealed a 2 Ã— 1.5 cm nodule in the right lung upper zone. A CT scan of the thorax confirmed the finding. Bronchoscopy, lavage, biopsy and screening for tuberculosis were negative. Owing to its technical difficulty, a CT-guided biopsy was deferred by the radiologist, hence we decided to perform segmentectomy that showed granuloma harbouring an adult Schistosoma worm. This is the first case of asymptomatic solitary pulmonary nodule due to adult Schistosoma worm 26 years after the exposure.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614775","annotations":[{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.820002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.775896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Pulmonary tuberculosis","weight":0.730233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.688919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.531894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.492638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.455508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.381316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Worm","weight":0.0568689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Medical literature","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_literature"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
