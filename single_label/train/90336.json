{"id":90336,"title":"Detection and characterization of tendon abnormalities with multidetector computed tomography.","abstract":"With recent advances in multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) acquisition and reconstruction options, MDCT can now be used successfully for evaluating tendon abnormalities. In this article, MDCT protocol optimization for the imaging of tendons is underscored, and applications of MDCT for assessing tendon pathology are highlighted. Although our retrospective experience of CT imaging with 2-dimensional multiplanar reconstructions and 3-dimensional postprocessing techniques is reviewed, potential applications for newer CT technologies, including dual-energy CT and 4-dimensional CT imaging of the peripheral tendons, are also discussed.
