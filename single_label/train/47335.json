{"id":47335,"title":"[Reversibility of hepatic fibrosis].","abstract":"Although chronic hepatitis has a diverse aetiology, development of hepatic fibrosis is the universal outcome. Cirrhosis is considered to be the universal end-stage of chronic liver disease. Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk for liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic fibrosis has long been considered irreversible. However, evidence has accumulated to suggest hepatic fibrosis can regress. In various liver diseases, it has been demonstrated that effective treatment of the underlying cause can result in regression of hepatic fibrosis. Currently, this is the best therapeutic approach for treatment of hepatic fibrosis. In patients with cirrhosis eradication or suppression of the underlying cause of the damage has also been shown to result in regression of hepatic fibrosis, however, it remains unclear if all histological transformations in cirrhosis are reversible. Patients with cirrhosis in whom the underlying cause was effectively treated have a reduced risk of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as improved survival.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594125","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Universal health care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Age regression in therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_regression_in_therapy"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Liver diseases","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_diseases"},{"name":"Chronic liver disease","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_liver_disease"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
