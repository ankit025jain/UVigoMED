{"id":66733,"title":"Infrastructures, treatment modalities, and workload of radiation oncology departments in Spain with special attention to prostate cancer.","abstract":"The purpose of the study was to describe infrastructures, treatment modalities, and workload in radiation oncology (RO) in Spain, referred particularly to prostate cancer (PC).An epidemiologic, cross-sectional study was performed during 2008-2009. A study-specific questionnaire was sent to the 108 RO-registered departments.One hundred and two departments answered the survey, and six were contacted by telephone. Centers operated 236 treatment units: 23 (9.7 %) cobalt machines, 37 (15.7 %) mono-energetic linear accelerators, and 176 (74.6 %) multi-energy linear accelerators. Sixty-one (56.4 %) and 33 (30.5 %) departments, respectively, reported intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and image-guided RT (IGRT) capabilities; three-dimensional-conformal RT was used in 75.8 % of patients. Virtual simulators were present in 95 departments (88.0 %), 35 use conventional simulators. Fifty-one departments (47.2 %) have brachytherapy units, 38 (35.2 %) perform prostatic implants. Departments saw a mean of 24.9 new patients/week; the number of patients treated annually was 102,054, corresponding to 88.4 % of patients with a RT indication. In 56.5 % of the hospitals, multidisciplinary teams were available to treat PC.Results provide an accurate picture of current situation of RO in Spain, showing a trend toward the progressive introduction of new technologies (IMRT, IGRT, brachytherapy).","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682792","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.682137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.584596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Cobalt","weight":0.556426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.537615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.517693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.323991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Linear particle accelerator","weight":0.166027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Image-guided radiation therapy","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-guided_radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Particle accelerator","weight":0.0362205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Romania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Progressivism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Workload","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload"}]}
