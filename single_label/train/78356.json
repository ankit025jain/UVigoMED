{"id":78356,"title":"Ciliopathy proteins regulate paracrine signaling by modulating proteasomal degradation of mediators.","abstract":"Cilia are critical mediators of paracrine signaling; however, it is unknown whether proteins that contribute to ciliopathies converge on multiple paracrine pathways through a common mechanism. Here, we show that loss of cilopathy-associated proteins Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4 (BBS4) or oral-facial-digital syndrome 1 (OFD1) results in the accumulation of signaling mediators normally targeted for proteasomal degradation. In WT cells, several BBS proteins and OFD1 interacted with proteasomal subunits, and loss of either BBS4 or OFD1 led to depletion of multiple subunits from the centrosomal proteasome. Furthermore, overexpression of proteasomal regulatory components or treatment with proteasomal activators sulforaphane (SFN) and mevalonolactone (MVA) ameliorated signaling defects in cells lacking BBS1, BBS4, and OFD1, in morphant zebrafish embryos, and in induced neurons from Ofd1-deficient mice. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that other proteasome-dependent pathways not known to be associated with ciliopathies are defective in the absence of ciliopathy proteins. We found that loss of BBS1, BBS4, or OFD1 led to decreased NF-?B activity and concomitant I?B? accumulation and that these defects were ameliorated with SFN treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that basal body proteasomal regulation governs paracrine signaling pathways and suggest that augmenting proteasomal function might benefit ciliopathy patients.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691443","annotations":[{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.892072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Zebrafish","weight":0.823761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish"},{"name":"Cilium","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Paracrine signalling","weight":0.792926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracrine_signalling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.701041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Centrosome","weight":0.6643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrosome"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.557442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Ciliopathy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliopathy"},{"name":"Basal body","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_body"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.157057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.138706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Bulletin board system","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system"},{"name":"Sulforaphane","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulforaphane"},{"name":"BBS4","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBS4"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Taken (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taken_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Volt-ampere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt-ampere"},{"name":"National Film Board of Canada","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada"},{"name":"Single-frequency network","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-frequency_network"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Ozone depletion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"International Baccalaureate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
