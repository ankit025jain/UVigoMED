{"id":84852,"title":"The olive leaf extract attenuates bacterial translocation and liver damage in obstructive jaundice.","abstract":"The olive leaf extract (OLext) is known to possess many biological properties including a powerful antioxidant. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of postoperative nutrition with OLext and glutamine on bacterial translocation (BT) and liver damage in obstructive jaundice.Totally, 50 rats were randomly divided into the five groups of 10 each. The common bile duct was ligated in all animals, excepting in the group 1. Postoperative nutrition was given to all groups for ten days. The rats in the Group 1 and 2 were fed a normal diet, Group 3 rats were fed an additional glutamine (1 g/kg/day), and Group 4 and 5 rats were fed an additional OLext (1 ml of 1/2 diluted and pure form/kg/day). Biochemical, microbiological and liver histopathological changes were evaluated.BT in the Groups 3, 4, and 5 was significantly lower than in the Group 2. The values of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), ?-glutamyl transferase (?-GT) and alkalen phosphatase (ALP) in blood were increased in obstructive jaundice, but the levels of these tests were statistically lower in glutamine and OLext groups when compared to the Group 2. Histopathological changes were observed low in the liver in OLext and glutamine groups.The present data has demonstrated that the supplementation of olive leaf extract and glutamine reduce the incidence of BT and liver damage in obstructive jaundiced rats (Tab. 4, Fig. 1, Ref. 23).","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25023426","annotations":[{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Glutamine","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.7441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.723347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.589617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.579363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.547333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.538001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Transferase","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferase"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.270446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.150999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Ligase","weight":0.131451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligase"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0801654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Olive","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"}]}
