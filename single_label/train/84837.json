{"id":84837,"title":"[Diagnostic value of the determination of angiogenic factors and cytokine composition parameters in the serum and urine of patients with scleroderma systematica].","abstract":"To study the associations of the concentration of interleukins (IL) 1beta, 6, 8, 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the serum and urine with the clinical features of scleroderma systematica (SDS).The investigation enrolled 51 patients with a valid SDS diagnosis. The serum and urinary concentrations of interleukins, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and VEGF were measured by solid-phase enzyme immunoassay.The patients with SDS were found to have higher serum and urine concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and VEGF than in the comparison group. There were relationships between the levels of VEGF and proinflammatory cytokines and the disease duration, clinical forms, and clinical manifestation of SDS.Higher serum VEGF levels in patients with SDS may be used to estimate the magnitude of endothelial dysfunction. Estimation of serum IL-6 concentrations may be employed to determine the degree of sclerosis progression; that of MCP1 for the activity of fibrosing alveolitis. Quantitative analysis of urinary IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF levels in patients with SDS may be used to evaluate tubulointerstitial inflammation and to predict the development of interstitial fibrosis.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026798","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Scleroderma","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleroderma"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"CCL2","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL2"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Interleukin 8","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_8"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.671246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.357647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.245853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.112661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alveolitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolitis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Metacarpophalangeal joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpophalangeal_joint"},{"name":"Sodium dodecyl sulfate","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"}]}
