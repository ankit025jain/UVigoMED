{"id":77862,"title":"[Development of a computed tomography data-based Vibrant Bonebridge viewer].","abstract":"Because of the anatomy of the mastoid and the size of the actuator, positioning of the Vibrant Bonebridge B-FMT can be difficult without prior evaluation of the individual computed tomography (CT) scan of the temporal bone. Development of a user-friendly CT data viewer to enable positioning of the B-FMT in the temporal bone model, whilst identifying individual, potential anatomic conflicts and offering possible solutions could provide a useful tool for preoperative positioning.Aim of the study was to define the requirements of a Vibrant Bonebridge viewer and construct a prototype.Based on a ZIBAmira software version and inclusion of a B-FMT model upon creation of a model of the temporal bone-which allows the intuitive estimation of individual, anatomic conflicts-a Vibrant Bonebridge viewer was constructed.The segmentation time of the individual digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) data set is about 5 min. Positioning within the individual three-dimensional temporal bone model allows quantitative and qualitative estimation of conflicts (sigmoid sinus, middle cranial fossa) and determination of a preferred position for the B-FMT. Lifting of the B-FMT can be simulated with the help of a virtual washer.The Vibrant Bonebridge viewer reliably allows simulation of B-FMT positioning. The clinical value of the viewer still has to be evaluated.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
