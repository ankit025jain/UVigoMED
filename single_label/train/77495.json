{"id":77495,"title":"Proton pump inhibition increases rapid eye movement sleep in the rat.","abstract":"Increased bodily CO2 concentration alters cellular pH as well as sleep. The proton pump, which plays an important role in the homeostatic regulation of cellular pH, therefore, may modulate sleep. We investigated the effects of the proton pump inhibitor \"lansoprazole\" on sleep-wakefulness. Male Wistar rats were surgically prepared for chronic polysomnographic recordings. Two different doses of lansoprazole (low: 1 mg/kg; high: 10 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally in the same animal (n = 7) and sleep-wakefulness was recorded for 6 hrs. The changes in sleep-wakefulness were compared statistically. Percent REM sleep amount in the vehicle and lansoprazole low dose groups was 9.26 ± 1.03 and 9.09 ± 0.54, respectively, which increased significantly in the lansoprazole high dose group by 31.75% (from vehicle) and 34.21% (from low dose). Also, REM sleep episode numbers significantly increased in lansoprazole high dose group. Further, the sodium-hydrogen exchanger blocker \"amiloride\" (10 mg/kg; i.p.) (n = 5) did not alter sleep-wake architecture. Our results suggest that the proton pump plays an important role in REM sleep modulation and supports our view that REM sleep might act as a sentinel to help maintain normal CO2 level for unperturbed sleep.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701564","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.725258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.714121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.527961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.515964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.386617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.366729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Eye movement (sensory)","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_(sensory)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Amiloride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiloride"},{"name":"Lansoprazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansoprazole"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Carbon monoxide","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"}]}
