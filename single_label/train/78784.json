{"id":78784,"title":"Quality of life after cholesteatoma surgery: intact-canal wall tympanoplasty versus canal wall-down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate, by means of the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), the quality of life of patients who had undergone either intact-canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) or canal wall-down tympanoplasty (CWDT) with mastoid obliteration.This was a retrospective case review study performed at a tertiary referral center. Among 379 patients affected by middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma operated on between November 2000 and December 2009, 50 patients who underwent ICWT and 50 who underwent CWDT with mastoid obliteration were randomly selected. The CES scores were analyzed for both groups.The mean scores on the CES were 6.5 ± 2.1 in patients who underwent CWDT and 6.9 ± 2.2 in patients treated with ICWT (t = -0.93; p > 0.05). No significant differences between the two groups were found on the activity restriction, symptom, or medical resource subscales (p > 0.05).The results of this study demonstrate that CWDT with mastoid obliteration resulted in a quality of life comparable with that after ICWT. Postoperative hearing loss is the most frequently reported problem for both techniques.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574463","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cholesteatoma","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesteatoma"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.341771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.276982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Middle ear","weight":0.242024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_ear"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.151276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.114562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tympanoplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tympanoplasty"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"379","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/379"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Consumer Electronics Show","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
