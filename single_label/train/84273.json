{"id":84273,"title":"[Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms at IL-6-174 and TNF-? NcoI in Chinese Han children in Guangzhou, China].","abstract":"To investigate the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at interleukin 6 (IL-6)-174 and TNF-? NcoI in Chinese Han children in Guangzhou, China and to provide basic information for study on the association between IL-6-174 and TNF-? NcoI polymorphisms and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to determine the SNPs at IL-6-174 and TNF-? NcoI in 481 children selected from the Han population in Guangzhou in 2012. Genotype analysis and comparison with other populations were made with reference to relevant literature.Chinese Han children in Guangzhou had only GG genotype at IL-6-174, and the SNP at this locus was rare or not seen in the Han population in Guangzhou. At TNF-? NcoI, the frequencies of TNF-? 1*1, TNF-? 1*2, and TNF-? 2*2 genotypes were 24.7%, 49.7%, and 25.6%, respectively. The sample distribution was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The TNF-? 1 allele frequency was significantly higher in Guangzhou Han population than in European and American white population (P<0.05).TNF-? NcoI SNP is prevalent in the Han population in Guangzhou, and the distribution of alleles is significantly different from that in the white population. The sample from an Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium population can be further used for study on the association between TNF-? NcoI SNP and SIRS in Chinese Han children in Guangzhou. IL-6-174 SNP is rare or not seen in the Han population in Guangzhou, so SNP at this locus cannot be selected for disease association analysis.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140780","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.841143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.835292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.831555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.756407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.649292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Allele frequency","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele_frequency"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.50408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","weight":0.380204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.28368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.263254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.161245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Guangzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Han Chinese","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
