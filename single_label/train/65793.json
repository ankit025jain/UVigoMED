{"id":65793,"title":"Spontaneous peripheral T-cell responses toward the tumor-associated antigen cyclin D1 in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous group of kidney cancers with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) as the major subgroup. To expand the number of clinically relevant tumor-associated antigens (TAA) that can be targeted by immunotherapy, we analyzed samples from 23 patients with primary ccRCC for the expression and immunogenicity of various TAAs. We found high-frequency expression of MAGE-A9 and NY-ESO-1 in 36% and 55% of samples, respectively, and overexpression of PRAME, RAGE-1, CA-IX, Cyclin D1, ADFP, C-MET, and RGS-5 in many of the tumor samples. We analyzed the blood of patients with HLA-A2(+) ccRCC for the presence of CD8(+) T cells specific for TAA-derived HLA-A2-restricted peptides and found spontaneous responses to cyclin D1 in 5 of 6 patients with Cyclin D1-positive tumors. Cyclin D1-specific CD8(+) T cells secreted TNF-?, IFN-?, and interleukin-2 (IL-2), and degranulated, indicating the presence of polyfunctional tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells in the blood of these patients with ccRCC. The high frequency (43%) of Cyclin D1 overexpression and the presence of functional cyclin D1-specific T cells in 83% of these patients with ccRCC suggest that cyclin D1 may be a target for immunotherapeutic strategies.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777966","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.827475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.814343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.768839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.759104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.744144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.725425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.710066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.697406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.407222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.403971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.260168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Cyclin D","weight":0.179468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D"},{"name":"Cyclin","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin"},{"name":"Cyclin D1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclin_D1"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
