{"id":50754,"title":"The Maastricht Study: an extensive phenotyping study on determinants of type 2 diabetes, its complications and its comorbidities.","abstract":"The Maastricht Study is an extensive phenotyping study that focuses on the etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), its classic complications, and its emerging comorbidities. The study uses state-of-the-art imaging techniques and extensive biobanking to determine health status in a population-based cohort of 10,000 individuals that is enriched with T2DM individuals. Enrollment started in November 2010 and is anticipated to last 5-7 years. The Maastricht Study is expected to become one of the most extensive phenotyping studies in both the general population and T2DM participants world-wide. The Maastricht study will specifically focus on possible mechanisms that may explain why T2DM accelerates the development and progression of classic complications, such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy and of emerging comorbidities, such as cognitive decline, depression, and gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and respiratory diseases. In addition, it will also examine the association of these variables with quality of life and use of health care resources. This paper describes the rationale, overall study design, recruitment strategy and methods of basic measurements, and gives an overview of all measurements that are performed within The Maastricht Study.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756374","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.845879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.673041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.633922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.492227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.425848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.413752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.368345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.147495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.111186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Food fortification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_fortification"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Radiation induced cognitive decline","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_induced_cognitive_decline"}]}
