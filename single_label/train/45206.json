{"id":45206,"title":"Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the most distal rectum: a dilemma in origin and management.","abstract":"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the rectum is a rare malignant entity that has been classically managed with a surgery-based approach, which included abdominoperineal resection for distal lesions. Recently there have been reports on the favourable outcomes achieved with the non-surgical management of these patients. We report a case of a 52-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a stage IIIa SCC located on the distal rectum. The patient was managed conservatively with a chemoradiation regime with mitomycin and 5-fluorouracil. Complete remission was achieved and she is currently alive, asymptomatic and disease-free after 30 months. This case adds to the existing evidence that supports the role of chemoradiation as a first-line curative treatment for the rare rectal SCC.
