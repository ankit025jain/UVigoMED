{"id":52132,"title":"The economic impact of hospitalization for diabetic foot infections in a Caribbean nation.","abstract":"Foot infection is the most common complication of diabetes mellitus in the Caribbean. Diabetic foot infections place a heavy burden on health care resources in the Caribbean.To evaluate the treatment-related costs for diabetic foot infections in a Caribbean nation.We identified all patients with diabetic foot infections in a 730-bed hospital serving a catchment population of approximately 400,000 persons from June 1, 2011 through July 31, 2012. The following data were collected: details of infection, antibiotic usage, investigations performed, number of physician consultations, details of operative treatment, and duration of hospitalization. Total charges were tallied to determine the final cost for inhospital treatment of diabetic foot infections.There were 446 patients hospitalized with diabetic foot infections, yielding approximately 0.75% annual risk for patients with diabetes to develop foot infections. The mean duration of hospitalization was 22.5 days. Sixteen patients (3.6%) were treated conservatively without an operative procedure and 430 (96.4%) required some form of operative intervention. There were 885 debridements, 193 minor amputations and 60 major amputations, 7102 wound dressings, 2763 wound cultures, and 27,015 glucometer measurements. When the hospital charges were tallied, a total of US $13,922,178 (mean, US $31,216) were spent to treat diabetic foot infections in these 446 patients during 1 year at this hospital.Each year, the government of Trinidad and Tobago spends US $85 million, or 0.4% of their gross domestic product, solely to treat patients hospitalized for diabetic foot infections. With this level of national expenditure and the anticipated increase in the prevalence of diabetes, it is necessary to revive the call for investment in preventive public health strategies.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626079","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes
