{"id":43361,"title":"Interleukin 28B rs12979860 single-nucleotide polymorphism predicts spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus in children.","abstract":"Recent genome-wide association studies performed in adults correlated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917) located on chromosome 19, upstream of the interleukin 28B gene, with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus and with response to treatment with paginated interferon and ribavirin. The aim of the present collaborative study was to evaluate the rs12979860 SNP in a large cohort of Italian children with perinatal acquisition of hepatitis C.Children were prospectively enrolled in 2 Italian centers. The interleukin 28B rs12979860 SNP was studied according to the diagnosis of chronic infection or spontaneous clearance.One hundred thirty children (86.7%) with chronic infection and 23 (13.3%) with spontaneous clearance of the virus were enrolled. Overall, the interleukin 28B C/C and C/T-T/T genotypes were found in 57 (37.3%) and 96 (62.7%) children, respectively. The proportion of C/C genotype was higher among children who cleared infection (14/23; 60.9%) compared with children with chronic infection (43/130; 33.1%; P = 0.01; odds ratio 3.15; 90% confidence intervals 1.34-7.53).The present study showed that, as already demonstrated in adults, children with the rs12979860?C/C SNP of the interleukin 28B gene have a higher probability of spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792632","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.795066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.698359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.686339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.684436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chromosome 19 (human)","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_19_(human)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.438789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.387592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.291964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.172373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Genetic association","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_association"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Interleukin 28","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_28"}]}
