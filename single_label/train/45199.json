{"id":45199,"title":"Endoscopic resection of large sporadic non-ampullary duodenal polyps: efficacy and long-term recurrence.","abstract":"Endoscopic resection is an alternative to surgery for removal of large duodenal polyps. There are limited data on the safety, efficacy, and long-term recurrence data after endoscopic resection of sporadic, non-ampullary, and large duodenal polyps.Our aim was to evaluate the safety and short-term outcomes of the endoscopic removal of the large sporadic duodenal polyps and to determine long-term risk of recurrence and factors predicting recurrence on follow-up.Patients with large (>10 mm) sporadic non-ampullary duodenal polyps underwent endoscopic resection from 2001 to 2012 at the Cleveland Clinic. Patients underwent endoscopic polypectomy and argon plasma coagulation. The main outcome measurements were complete polypectomy, complications, short- and long-term recurrence.A total of 54 patients were included. The mean patient age was 66.4 years. The mean polyp size was 15.1 ± 5.4 mm. Most polyps (N = 48, 88.9 %) were sessile polyps. The median follow-up time was 10.8 (range 0.5-120) months. Most lesions were located in the second part of the duodenum (N = 41, 75.9 %). Adenomas were found in 46 (85.2 %) of lesions overall. Tubular adenoma was the most common histology type found in 33 cases (71.7 %). Tubulovillous and villous were found in 12 (26.1 %) and 1 (2.2 %) cases, respectively. On follow-up, 50 (92.6 %) achieved complete resection with tumor free margins post resection. The 30-day risk of major complications was 5.6 % (N = 3), 1 with perforation and 2 with delayed bleeding. Recurrence was documented in 29 % (N = 16) of patients. All recurrences were managed endoscopically except for one patient who required surgery. The recurrence rate was higher for patients who had villous component in their adenomas compared to those with tubular alone (p = 0.03).Endoscopic resection is effective for treating large duodenal adenomas. Adenomas with villous features are more likely to recur. Almost all recurrences can be managed endoscopically.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695983","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.814388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"Polypectomy","weight":0.814154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypectomy"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.775701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cleveland Clinic","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic"},{"name":"Argon plasma coagulation","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon_plasma_coagulation"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Intestinal villus","weight":0.708844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_villus"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.471439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Argon","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.334742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"}]}
