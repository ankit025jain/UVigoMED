{"id":67640,"title":"Urolithiasis: phytotherapy as an adjunct therapy.","abstract":"Role of herbal drugs and medicinal plant extracts in the successful treatment of urolithiasis, classified as the third most common urinary tract diseases is well documented. Ayurvedic plants and their components mediate antilithogenic effects by altering ionic composition of urine, being diuretic, antioxidant or having antimicrobial activity. Therapeutic peptides and proteins have unique place in pharmaceutical biotechnology due to their critical roles in cell biology. The innovation in antilithiatic proteins is that they are anionic, rich in acidic amino acids which make oxalate unavailable by interacting with calcium and have EF Hand domain which is a characteristic feature of various calcium binding protein like calgranulin, osteopontin. The review provides a background on the pathogenesis of urolithiasis and medical treatments. It focusses on the present research evaluating the scientific basis of antilithiatic potential of various plants and role of plant proteins as therapeutic agents thus opening new vista in the management of urolithiasis. Further investigations are required to fully decipher the mode of action of the potent biomolecules so as to exploit their preventive and therapeutic potential.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597142","annotations":[{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Biotechnology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.819178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Ayurveda","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.750261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Biomolecule","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomolecule"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Oxalate","weight":0.661495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.608052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.592943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Ionic bond","weight":0.515277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bond"},{"name":"Phytotherapy","weight":0.508823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytotherapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.406857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.358761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.316664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.223028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.136827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"}]}
