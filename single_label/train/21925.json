{"id":21925,"title":"Electric suction-lavage device for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery treatment of empyema and hemothorax.","abstract":"We describe the use of an electric trigger-controlled suction-lavage device for the evacuation of empyema or clotted hemothorax. Wound debridement systems provide efficient irrigation and debris removal. It is frequently used for orthopedic procedures or infected wound rinsing. Internet search of the literature did not result in any paper describing the use of this technique for thoracic surgery. We present our experience with an electrical wound-washing device in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for thoracic empyema or clotted hemothorax.
