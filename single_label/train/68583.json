{"id":68583,"title":"New horizons: urinary incontinence in older people.","abstract":"Urinary incontinence is a common complaint in older people, and is associated with significant impact on the individual, their carers and the wider healthcare system. As the numbers of frail elderly people increase, so will the burden of incontinence. This review examines recent developments in research into the aetiology, physiology, pathology and treatment of urinary incontinence and lower urinary tract symptoms in older people, and explores potential future developments which might reduce or ameliorate both urinary incontinence and its effects on frail older people. These include increasing understanding of the importance of central control of continence, the role of the urothelium as a sensory organ, novel targets for pharmacological treatments and surgical and invasive interventions.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509954","annotations":[{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.687788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Sensory system","weight":0.625776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_system"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.490336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.473334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.461534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.296142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Frailty syndrome","weight":0.0408123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frailty_syndrome"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"}]}
