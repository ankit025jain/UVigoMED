{"id":53398,"title":"Perifosine inhibits S6K1-Gli1 signaling and enhances gemcitabine-induced anti-pancreatic cancer efficiency.","abstract":"The pancreatic cancer has extremely low overall 5-year survival, and gemcitabine is the only approved single agent for pancreatic cancer treatment.In the present study, we investigated the potential effect of perifosine, a novel Akt inhibitor on gemcitabine-induced anti-pancreatic cancer effect both in vivo and in vitro.We showed that sub-cytotoxic low concentration of perifosine dramatically enhanced gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity in cultured pancreatic cancer cells. Perifosine inhibited Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin and Erk-mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in pancreatic cancer cells. Meanwhile, perifosine suppressed the hedgehog signaling, as it inhibited glioma-associated oncogenes (Gli) 1 activation and decreased its target protein patched 1 (PTCH1) expression. Our data demonstrated that perifosine blocked p70S6K1 (S6K1) activation, thus disrupting S6K1-Gli1 association and subsequent Gli1 activation. The reduction of S6K1 or Gli1 expression by target siRNAs inhibited PTCH1 expression and enhanced gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells. Significantly, perifosine dramatically enhanced gemcitabine-mediated antitumor effect in a PANC-1 xenograft severe combined immunodeficiency mice model.In summary, we conclude that perifosine sensitizes gemcitabine-mediated anti-pancreatic cancer efficiency through regulating multiple signaling pathways.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519751","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Severe combined immunodeficiency","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_combined_immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.799947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.773928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.759401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Sirolimus","weight":0.716811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.703722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.659502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.633153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.617919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.579947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Ribosome","weight":0.483757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.470048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Gemcitabine","weight":0.347629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemcitabine"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.25896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.243501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Hedgehog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog"},{"name":"GLI1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLI1"},{"name":"PTCH1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTCH1"},{"name":"P70-S6 Kinase 1","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P70-S6_Kinase_1"},{"name":"Perifosine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perifosine"},{"name":"Combined immunodeficiencies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_immunodeficiencies"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
