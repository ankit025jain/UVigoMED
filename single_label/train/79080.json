{"id":79080,"title":"Establishment of a normative database for the Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) measure.","abstract":"The Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) measure is a well-established disease-specific quality of life instrument for voice disorders. This study aims to establish a large, heterogenous V-RQOL normative database.The V-RQOL measure was completed by adult volunteers with no voice complaints in the preceding 6Â months. Standardized scores were calculated. Mean scores and standard deviations (SDs) were calculated by demographic category and analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance test.Results were available for 253 responders with a mean V-RQOL score of 94.8 (SD 10.1). There was no difference in scores among age groups, gender, or employment status.This study provides normative values for the V-RQOL measure. Clinicians using this instrument for clinical or research purposes may use this database for a more complete understanding and interpretation of their results.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495424","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.346639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.248824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.224431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"List of voice disorders","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_voice_disorders"},{"name":"South Dakota Highway 10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_Highway_10"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"253","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/253"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Interpretation (logic)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(logic)"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"The Establishment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Establishment"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
