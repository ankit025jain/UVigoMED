{"id":73014,"title":"Sustained focal antitumor activity of bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma.","abstract":"To investigate the relevance of bevacizumab (BEV)-induced diffusion-restricted lesions and T1-hyperintense lesions in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.We prospectively screened 74 BEV-treated patients with recurrent glioblastoma for (1) diffusion-restricted lesions and/or, (2) lesions with a hyperintense signal on precontrast T1-weighted images. We further evaluated overall survival (OS), histopathology of the lesions, and patterns of progression.Twenty-five of 74 patients (34%) developed T1-hyperintense lesions, whereas diffusion-restricted lesions could be detected in 35 of 74 patients (47%). In 21 of 74 patients (28%), the lesions displayed both features (\"double-positive\"). OS for patients with double-positive lesions was 13.0 months; patients with neither of these lesions had an OS of 6.6 months (p < 0.005). Histologic evaluation of double-positive lesions revealed extensive calcified necrosis in 4 of 4 patients. Notably, these double-positive lesions were rarely involved in further tumor progression. However, they were associated with an increase in distant recurrences at BEV failure.BEV-induced double-positive MRI lesions are a predictive imaging marker associated with a substantial survival benefit and with improved local control in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Our data suggest that these lesions are the result of a sustained focal antitumor activity of BEV.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928118","annotations":[{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.617905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.610083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.540985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.435639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Battery electric vehicle","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"}]}
