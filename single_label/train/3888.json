{"id":3888,"title":"Issues patients would like to discuss at their review consultation in breast cancer clinics--a cross-sectional survey.","abstract":"In breast cancer (BC) there are different therapies available with different side effects affecting the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients. Here we report a novel tool, the BC-specific Patient Concerns Inventory (PCI). This work includes a survey that is part of the validation process to allow a larger cohort and comparisons with clinical characteristics. We report the concerns that BC patients would like to discuss in the outpatient clinic - using the PCI - and also their choice of multidisciplinary team members they would like to see.We carried out a cross-sectional survey - using the BC-specific PCI, the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC BC QLQ-BR23 - of patients who had completed their initial treatment and were attending a review outpatient clinic. 249 patients were recruited from February to July 2012.Survey responses were obtained from 80% (200/249). The three most frequent items were fear of cancer coming back (62%, 124), breast sensitivity/pain (46%, 92), and fatigue/tiredness and low energy levels overall (46%, 92). The most frequently selected members of the multidisciplinary team that patients wished to see were the breast care nurse (46%, 92), the medical oncologist (28%, 55) and the psychologist (20%, 40).The PCI provides the opportunity for multiprofessional engagement across a range of issues specific to BC. It can identify issues relating to physical, psychological, sexual and social functioning, as well as issues relating to body image and lifestyle.","date":"2014-10-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25343554","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.803284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.802814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Psychologist","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Body image","weight":0.664712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.312826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.282582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.257175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.146946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.121605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0541379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0355796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"EORTC","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EORTC"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Engagement","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"}]}
