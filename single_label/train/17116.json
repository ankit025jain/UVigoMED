{"id":17116,"title":"[Preparation of an autophagy-targeted antituberculosis DNA vaccine encoding LpqH fused with LC3].","abstract":"To construct an autophagy-targeted vaccine harboring the genes encoding lipoprotein antigen precursor LpqH from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and microtubule-associated protein light chain-3(LC3), and to investigate its efficacy of inducing and targeting autophagy.The expressions of LC-3 and LC3-LpqH in RAW264.7 cells were detected by Western blotting after transfected with pCMV-LpqH and pCMV-LC3-LpqH plasmids respectively. The pCMV-LC3-LpqH or pCMV-LpqH plasmids were transfected into GFP-LC3-RAW264.7 cells to analyze the localization of LC3-LpqH by immunofluorescence staining.After transfected with pCMV-LpqH DNA, RAW264.7 cells showed a significant increase of LC-3 amount. The LC3-LpqH fusion protein was also detected in RAW264.7 cells after pCMV-LC3-LpqH transfection and in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, LpqH was found to be transported to autophagosomes through the fusion protein, which was demonstrated by the co-localization of GFP-LC3 and LC3-LpqH on autophagosomes.The recombinant plasmid encoding pCMV-LC3-LpqH could enhance the autophagy in vitro, and facilitate the localization of LpqH on autophagosomes. Our study provides a new practical strategy for the development of improved vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909277","annotations":[{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.89374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.893239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.842255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.839916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.818652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Fusion protein","weight":0.748727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.686664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"DNA vaccination","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccination"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.357569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.168332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"264","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/264"},{"name":"Penal transportation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_transportation"},{"name":"Expression (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)"},{"name":"LC-3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
