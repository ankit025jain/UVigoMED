{"id":80256,"title":"Vaccination with Toxoplasma lysate antigen and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides: comparison of immune responses in intranasal versus intramuscular administrations.","abstract":"Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is one of the most successful intracellular protozoan parasites on earth and highly prevalent in most warm-blooded vertebrates. There are no drugs that target the chronic cyst stage of this infection; therefore, development of an effective vaccine would be an important advance in disease control. Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) which contain immunostimulatory CG motifs (CpG ODN) can promote T-helper 1 (Th1) responses, an adjuvant activity that is desirable for vaccination against intracellular pathogen. In this study, we compare the immune responses of Toxoplasma susceptible C57BL/6 mice following intranasal and intramuscular vaccination with Toxoplasma lysate antigen (TLA) with or without CpG ODN as adjuvant. Immunized and control non-immunized mice were challenged with 85 cyst of the moderately virulent Beverley strain of T. gondii. Intranasal vaccination gave significantly a higher protection compared to other groups as indicated by prolonged survival and significantly reduced brain cyst burden (P?<?0.01). Intranasal vaccination stimulated cellular immunity towards Th1 response characterized by significant INF-? production (P?<?0.01). Furthermore, fecal IgA antibody levels as an indicator of mucosal immune responses were significantly higher (P?<?0.05) in intranasal vaccinated group before the challenge compared to all other groups. Intranasal vaccination was not able to upgrade the Th1 humoral arm. In contrast, intramuscular vaccination enhanced humoral immunity towards a type Th1 pattern characterized by a significant increase of specific IgG and Ig2a. Our results suggest that intranasal administration of CpG/TLA would provide a stable, pronounced, and effective vaccine against toxoplasmosis through stimulation of Th1 cellular immunity and mucosal IgA.
