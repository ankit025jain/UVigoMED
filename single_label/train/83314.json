{"id":83314,"title":"Beneficial effect of low caloric intake in the early period after orthotopic liver transplantation: a new concept using graft weight.","abstract":"Although various factors are correlated with early graft function after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), caloric supplementation is not considered in postoperative period. This retrospective study investigated the correlation between caloric intake and early graft function and compared calorie/ body weight ratio (CBWR) and calorie/graft weight ratio (CGWR) as standards for nutritional provision.Patients were divided into the low caloric group (<18 kcal/kg/day) and eucaloric group (?18 kcal/kg/day) according to caloric intake until 48 hours post-OLT. Graft function was assessed according to aminotransferase level, bilirubin level, and international normalised ratio (INR) on postoperative days (POD) 0, 2, and 7. The variables associated with caloric intake were compared to identify the superiority between CBWR and CGWR.There were 32 and 8 patients in the low caloric and eucaloric groups. INR on POD 2 was significantly lower in the low caloric group (p = 0.018). CGWR was more strongly correlated with INR than CBWR on POD 2 (r = 0.08, p = 0.63 vs. r = 0.36, p = 0.024).Low caloric intake has a beneficial effect on the restoration of early graft function. CGWR is superior to CBWR as a standard for nutritional supplementation.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436360","annotations":[{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.729513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.506856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.426857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.372222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Calorie","weight":0.353921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.125636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Food energy","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_energy"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Ostfriesische Lufttransport","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostfriesische_Lufttransport"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Beneficial insects","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficial_insects"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Hyperrectangle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperrectangle"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Strongly correlated material","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"}]}
