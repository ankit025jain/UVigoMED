{"id":78619,"title":"[Clinical analysis of the diagnosis and treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo by TRV-CRP].","abstract":"To explore the effective of the new mechanical assistant canalith repositioning procedure (TRV-CRP) to the diagnosis and treatment of the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).The data of the cases with suspected diagnosis of BPPV from April to June of 2012 checked and treated by TRV-CRP in our vestibular function checking room were collected and analyzed. All of the cases were followed up to one to three months.Total 504 cases of suspected diagnosis of BPPV were collected. Three cases were rejected for un completed procedure. All of the 501 completed procedure cases included 162 male and 339 female with age ranging from 10 years old to 86 years old (52. 8 +/- 14 years old). 169 cases (33.73%) were positive diagnosis and 332 cases were negative diagnosis (66.27%). 135 cases enrolled only one semicircular canal (SC) account for 79.89% of all the positive diagnosis that included 17 cases of left horizontal SC, 4 cases of left superior SC, 29 cases of left posterior SC, 23 cases of right horizontal SC, 4 cases of superior SC and 58 cases of right posterior SC. 25 cases enrolled more than two SC (14.80%). 9 cases of objective BPPV (5.33%) included 5 cases of right posterior SC, 3 cases of left posterior SC and one cases of right horizontal SC. Exception of 163 cases without classic BPPV history in the 332 negative diagnosis cases, 169 cases had classic BPPV history including 14 cases treated by manual canalith repositioning procedure and 33 cases which had released from the vertigo. The rate of treatment effective by TRV-CRP was 100%. There were 20 cases returned for retreatment because their unsatisfied about the release of their symptom but proved to be negative diagnosis again in 10 cases and positive diagnosis in 10 cases, however, only 4 cases proved to be the same SC disease were considered as relapse (2.37%) and others enrolled different SC. After retreated, all cases got release without relapse.TRV-CRP could diagnosis 34% of the primary diagnosis cases of BPPV. TRV-CRP had high rate of effective and lower relapse which especially fitted to patients suffered from complex BPPV or difficult to finish the manual repositioning procedure. However, due to the expensive of TRV-CRP, it is reasonable to combine TRV-CRP and manual repositioning procedure in clinical.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616981","annotations":[{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.487499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.245635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vestibular system","weight":0.0979389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibular_system"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Semicircular canal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircular_canal"},{"name":"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo"},{"name":"South Carolina Highway 14","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Highway_14"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Horizontal plane","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_plane"},{"name":"Positional notation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation"},{"name":"Semicircle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicircle"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Paroxysmal attack","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxysmal_attack"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
