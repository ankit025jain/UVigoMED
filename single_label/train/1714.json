{"id":1714,"title":"[The accessibility of high-tech medical care of newborns with surgical pathology in conditions of Far North].","abstract":"The actual stage of development of public health rendering of specialized medical care is based on principles of generality, accessibility, addressness, qualitativeness, and effectiveness. However, the problem of rendering specialized medical care to population is one of most critical targets in district centers and requires immediate solution. The main mean of resolving this problem is re-hospitalization of patient in more large-scale medical institutions. The rendering of high-tech medical care, surgery care included, to newborns in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) is possible only in conditions of metropolitan health institutions i.e. medical institutions of third level. Annually, almost half of newborns with surgical pathology is transported from central district hospital. The organization of reanimation counseling center, maintenance of remote monitoring of newborns and development of telemedicine and means of sanitary aviation play main role in supporting accessibility of high-tech medical care in conditions of this region.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25373299","annotations":[{"name":"Public health","weight":0.818239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.782668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Telemedicine","weight":0.69745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemedicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.435994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Aviation","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sakha Republic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakha_Republic"},{"name":"Surgical pathology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_pathology"},{"name":"District hospital","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_hospital"},{"name":"Rendering (computer graphics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)"},{"name":"Republic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Center (basketball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)"},{"name":"RMON","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMON"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Yakuts","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuts"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Resurrection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Accessibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility"}]}
