{"id":71108,"title":"Research progress on synergistic anti-tumor mechanisms of compounds in traditional Chinese medicine.","abstract":"The curative effects of Chinese herbal compounds result from the coordination of numerous natural compounds. We aimed to review the mechanism of action of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compounds (TCMC), explore the rationality of formulation theory and synergistic effects in TCM compounds, and analyze the effectiveness of drug compatibility of TCMC in molecular biology. This literature review covers the mechanisms of the anti-tumor effects of compounds, and their synergistic antitumor mechanisms. We aim to provide reference for the effective development and use of natural resources and the organic combination of TCM and modern medicine using molecular biology.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102699","annotations":[{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.633002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.488165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.481076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.47983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.428393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.353449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese characters","weight":0.29509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters"},{"name":"China","weight":0.262488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Rationality","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.143667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Chinese herbology","weight":0.0585202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_herbology"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Mechanism (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
