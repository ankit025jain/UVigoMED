{"id":70372,"title":"Functional analysis of long noncoding RNAs in development and disease.","abstract":"Once viewed as part of the \"dark matter\" of genome, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are mRNA-like but lack open reading frames, have emerged as an integral part of the mammalian transcriptome. Recent work demonstrated that lncRNAs play multiple structural and functional roles, and their analysis has become a new frontier in biomedical research. In this chapter, we provide an overview of different lncRNA families, describe methodologies available to study lncRNA-protein and lncRNA-DNA interactions systematically, and use well-studied lncRNAs as examples to illustrate their functional importance during normal development and in disease states.
