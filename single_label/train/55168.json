{"id":55168,"title":"Comparison of the optical coherence tomographic characters between acute Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and acute central serous chorioretinopathy.","abstract":"Acute Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and acute central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) are two common disorders with serous retinal detachment caused by dysfunction of choroid. The purpose of this study is to compare the morphological changes of these two diseases with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).In this retrospective comparative study, the SD-OCT images of 65 eyes with acute VKH and 52 eyes with acute CSCR were reviewed for the presence of subretinal fluid, folds of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE), fluctuation of internal limiting membrane (ILM), subretinal septa, retinal pigment epithelium detachment (PED) and bulge of RPE. The foveal thickness was measured using the manual caliper of OCT software. The characteristics of SD-OCT were compared between two diseases.Subretinal fluid was present in both diseases. Folds of RPE, fluctuation of ILM, subretinal septa were seen only in VKH. Bulge of RPE presented only in CSCR. PED was more common in CSCR than in VKH (44.2% vs 3.1%, p < 0.001). The thickness of fovea and RPE undulation index were significantly greater in VKH compared to that in CSCR (746.7 ± 423.8 vs 444.9 ± 158.8 ?m, p < 0.001 and 1.0667 ± 0.0509 vs. 1.0177 ± 0.0023, p = 0.003).Our study showed that although VKH and CSCR share similar features on SDOCT, there are characteristic differences between both disease entities.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974016","annotations":[{"name":"Retinal detachment","weight":0.91736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_detachment"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Fovea centralis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.793433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.720697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.621832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.453116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.339407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.319003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.300489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Central serous retinopathy","weight":0.153461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_serous_retinopathy"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"423","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/423"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Ben Folds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Folds"},{"name":"Manual transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Conjuncture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjuncture"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foveal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveal"},{"name":"Penis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis"},{"name":"Industrial Light & Magic","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Light_&_Magic"},{"name":"Caliper","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliper"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"}]}
