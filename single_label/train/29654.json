{"id":29654,"title":"Effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure on behavioral and cognitive findings at 7.5 years of age.","abstract":"To examine child behavioral and cognitive outcomes after prenatal exposure to methamphetamine.We enrolled 412 mother-infant pairs (204 methamphetamine-exposed and 208 unexposed matched comparisons) in the Infant Development, Environment, and Lifestyle study. The 151 children exposed to methamphetamine and 147 comparisons who attended the 7.5-year visit were included. Exposure was determined by maternal self-report and/or positive meconium toxicology. Maternal interviews assessed behavioral and cognitive outcomes using the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form.After adjusting for covariates, children exposed to methamphetamine had significantly higher cognitive problems subscale scores than comparisons and were 2.8 times more likely to have cognitive problems scores that were above average on the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form. No association between prenatal methamphetamine exposure and behavioral problems, measured by the oppositional, hyperactivity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder index subscales, were found.Prenatal methamphetamine exposure was associated with increased cognitive problems, which may affect academic achievement and lead to increased negative behavioral outcomes.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630350","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.813961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.740915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.722028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Meconium","weight":0.654808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meconium"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.505722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.228415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"208","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/208"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Nielsen ratings","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings"},{"name":"Opposition (parliamentary)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_(parliamentary)"},{"name":"Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Short_Form_Music_Video"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Pair bond","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_bond"},{"name":"Smoking and pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_and_pregnancy"}]}
