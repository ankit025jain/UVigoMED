{"id":92077,"title":"Pyloric trichobezoar in a Canadian lynx (Lynx canadensis).","abstract":"An adult female Canadian lynx (Lynx canadensis) was presented with a 3-wk history of anorexia and lethargy. Initial examination and diagnostics did not provide a diagnosis. The lynx continued to demonstrate vague clinical signs, including anorexia and an abnormal gait. During follow-up immobilizations 2 wk later, a barium gastrointestinal study revealed a pyloric obstruction. Abdominal exploratory surgery was elected, and a gastrotomy and an enterotomy of the proximal duodenum were performed to remove the pyloric obstruction. The obstruction was determined to be a trichobezoar. Fleas, a likely cause of hair ingestion through grooming, were noted during surgical preparation. The lynx made a full recovery from surgery. Reoccurrence of the trichobezoar was prevented after surgery with the use of monthly flea control and three times a week hairball laxative.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450081","annotations":[{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.850827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.79742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Laxative","weight":0.783055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.75678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.545609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.475277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.448729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Hair","weight":0.348154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Flea","weight":0.232456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea"},{"name":"Bezoar","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezoar"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0484734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Barium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium"},{"name":"Lynx","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx"},{"name":"Hairball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairball"},{"name":"Pylorus","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus"},{"name":"Personal grooming","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_grooming"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
