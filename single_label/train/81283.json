{"id":81283,"title":"The role of hemisection in the prosthetic management of a distal extension ridge--a case report.","abstract":"This case report illustrates the use of hemisection to minimize the distal extension span. The LR6 was the only molar next to a distal extension of the lower Kennedy's Class II ridge. Its unrestorable distal root was removed and its mesial portion was retained to serve as an effective antagonist and abutment tooth and lessen the extent of right distal extension.Regarding the prosthetic rehabilitation of distal extensions, hemisection can be advantageous and offered as an alternative to other treatment modalities.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195483","annotations":[{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.164911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.146574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.036042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Abutment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abutment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Kennedy family","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_family"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Ridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Span (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_(architecture)"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
