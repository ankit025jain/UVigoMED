{"id":52084,"title":"Risk of suicidal ideation in diabetes varies by diabetes regimen, diabetes duration, and HbA1c level.","abstract":"To investigate patient subgroups based on the clinical characteristics of diabetes to evaluate risk factors for suicidal ideation using a large population-based sample in South Korea.Data from the Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey, were analyzed. The participants were 9159 subjects aged ?40years. We defined patients with diabetes based on self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes. We evaluated clinical risk factors for suicidal ideation according to diabetes regimen, diabetes duration, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level compared with no diabetes. Given the complex sample design and unequal weights, we analyzed weighted percentages and used survey logistic regression.Diabetes per se was not associated with suicidal ideation. However, suicidal ideation was significantly more prevalent among patients who had injected insulin, had a duration of diabetes ?5years and had HbA1c levels ?6.5 compared with those without diabetes. Depressive symptoms were the most prominent predictor of suicidal ideation.Insulin therapy, diabetes of long duration, and unsatisfactory glycemic control were identified as risk factors for suicidal ideation; thus, patients with these characteristics warrant special attention. Our findings suggest the need to integrate efforts to manage emotional distress into diabetes care.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630176","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.947293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.738373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.725618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.694703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.594254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.498541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Suicidal ideation","weight":0.391559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.322557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Intensive insulinotherapy","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_insulinotherapy"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Nutrition_Examination_Survey"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Design of experiments","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Globalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
