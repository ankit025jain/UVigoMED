{"id":34986,"title":"[Risk factors and prognosis of emergency cesarean delivery at the Yaoundé Women's and Children's Hospital, Cameroon].","abstract":"To identify the risk factors for emergency cesarean deliveries and assess the effects of the emergency situation on maternal and fetal prognosis.This retrospective cohort study compared emergency and elective cesarean deliveries performed at the Yaoundé Women's and Children's Hospital in Cameroon, analyzing socioeconomic variables, the indications for surgery, and complications for mother and child.Risk factors predisposing to emergency cesareans were: age <20 years, not having a salaried job, unmarried status, no university-level education, referral from other health facilities, primiparity, prenatal care in a health center or in a district hospital, prenatal care by a nurse, and preadmission rupture of membranes. Emergency cesareans increased the mothers risk of general anesthesia, unavailability of standard preoperative work-up during surgery, infection, and a longer hospital stay. Babies born by emergency cesarean delivery had a higher risk of admission to the neonatology unit, neonatal asphyxia, neonatal infection, preterm birth, and perinatal death.In our setting, lack of reproductive experience (primiparity), low socioeconomic level, poor prenatal care, and preadmission rupture of membranes were risk factors for emergency cesarean deliveries. The emergency situation exposes mother and child to a significant risk of morbidity and mortality.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686497","annotations":[{"name":"Asphyxia","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia"},{"name":"Perinatal mortality","weight":0.844261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_mortality"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Neonatology","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatology"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.775142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.772237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.673715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Perinatal asphyxia","weight":0.670202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_asphyxia"},{"name":"Prenatal care","weight":0.665194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_care"},{"name":"Mother","weight":0.64342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.475044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.433358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.194454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Cameroon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Medical test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Choice","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice"}]}
