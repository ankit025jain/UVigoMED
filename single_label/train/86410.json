{"id":86410,"title":"VATS-based approach for robotic lobectomy.","abstract":"Lobectomy with systematic lymph node sampling or dissection remains the mainstay of treatment of early stage non-small cell lung cancer. The use of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) to perform lobectomy was first reported in 1992. Advantages of VATS include less trauma and pain, shorter chest drainage duration, decreased hospital stay, and preservation of short-term pulmonary function. However, VATS is characterized by loss of binocular vision and a limited maneuverability of thoracoscopic instruments, an unstable camera platform, and poor ergonomics for the surgeon. To overcome these limitations, robotic systems were developed during the last decades. This article reviews the technical aspects of robotic lobectomy using a VATS-based approach.
