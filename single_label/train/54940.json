{"id":54940,"title":"Half-time photodynamic therapy for central serous chorioretinopathy.","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety using fluorescein angiography (FA)-guided half-time photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of acute or chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and to evaluate the prognostic factors for visual acuity.Sixteen eyes with CSC treated with the same protocol in a single hospital were retrospectively enrolled in the study; all eyes were treated using FA-guided half-time PDT (42 seconds). Logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) before and 3 months after PDT was measured. The time to complete subretinal fluid resorption was observed. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic factors for logMAR of BCVA before and at 3 months after PDT and the change in logMAR after PDT.The mean (±SD) follow-up time after PDT was 12.1 (±9.2) months. The mean (±SD) logMAR of BCVA significantly improved from 0.28 (±0.21) before PDT to 0.21 (±0.21) at 3 months after PDT (p = 0.003). All eyes showed complete resolution of subretinal fluid and retinal pigmented epithelium detachment on optical coherence tomography within 5 weeks after PDT. No treatment-related complications were reported. The duration of symptoms before PDT was significantly correlated with the pre-PDT logMAR of BCVA (p = 0.004) and the post-PDT logMAR of BCVA (p = 0.0009) but not with the logMAR change after PDT (p = 0.25).Fluorescein angiography-guided half-time PDT was safe and effective in treating both acute and chronic CSC. Early treatment was important for preserving visual acuity.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25083838","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.825712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Fluorescein angiography","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein_angiography"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.620849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.584925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.541595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Fluorescein","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescein"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.329465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.235948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.2201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.135098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Pacific Time Zone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Central serous retinopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_serous_retinopathy"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Image resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution"},{"name":"Half-time","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-time"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resorption"}]}
