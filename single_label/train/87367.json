{"id":87367,"title":"[Manipulative reduction with minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis for 60 patients with distal tibiofibular fractures].","abstract":"To explore clinical effects of manipulative reduction with minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis in treating distal tibiofibular fractures.From 2009 to 2011, 60 patients with distal tibiofibular fractures were treated by manipulative reduction with minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis. Among them, there were 32 males and 28 females aged from 14 to 70 years old with an average of 41.22 +/- 2.06. According to AO classification of fractures,5 cases were type A1, 22 cases were type A2,21 cases were type A3 and 12 cases were type C1. Operation time, blood loss,time of callus and fracture healing were observed, Mazur scoring of ankle joint were used to evaluate therapeutic.Fifty-eight incisions were healed at stage I ,and 2 cases were infected at distal tibial. Operation time was with an average of (62.34 +/- 5.66) min ranged 45 to 90 min;blood loss was 30 to 150 ml with an average of (80.57 +/- 5.59) ml;formation of callus appeared from 4 to 12 weeks,with an average of (8.24 +/- 2.06) weeks, and fracture healing time was from 3 to 6 months, with an average of (4.50 +/- 1.13) months. According to Mazur scoring of ankle joint 40 cases got excellent results, 18 good, and 2 fair.Manipulative reduction with minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis can obtain reliable fixation. It is a good choice of treating distal tibiofibular fractures by protecting blood supply of fractures.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241469","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.73612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.668337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.637209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.41758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.301306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.287592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.20913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.143256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.119397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Osteosynthesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosynthesis"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"AC power plugs and sockets","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Mazur","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazur"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Type A and Type B personality theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory"}]}
