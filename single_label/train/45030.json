{"id":45030,"title":"Treatment patterns and clinical outcomes for patients with de novo versus recurrent HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.","abstract":"Improvements in screening and adjuvant therapy for breast cancer are associated with decreased recurrence, which may have the effect of increasing the proportion of patients presenting with first-line de novo versus recurrent metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Here, we describe and compare patients with de novo versus recurrent human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive MBC. registHER was a prospective observational cohort study (late 2003-early 2006) of 1,023 patients with HER2-positive MBC. Baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes were examined in patients with newly diagnosed de novo (n = 327) compared with recurrent HER2-positive MBC after prior treatment for early-stage disease (n = 674). Patients with de novo HER2-positive MBC were less likely to have lung metastases, more likely to have lymph node, bone, and/or liver metastases and >4 sites of metastases and more likely to receive combined or concurrent chemotherapy and hormonal therapy with or without trastuzumab than those with recurrent HER2-positive MBC. Median follow-up was 29 months. Median progression-free survival was 12.1 versus 9.3 months [hazard ratio = 0.716 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.617-0.831)], and overall survival was 41.7 versus 32.8 months [hazard ratio = 0.766 (95 % CI 0.633-0.928)] for patients with de novo versus recurrent HER2-positive MBC, respectively. Patients with recurrent HER2-positive MBC had similar outcomes regardless of whether they received prior adjuvant therapy, excluding hormonal therapy. Despite presenting with more advanced-stage disease and higher tumor burdens, patients with de novo HER2-positive MBC have more favorable clinical outcomes than those with recurrent HER2-positive MBC. These differences may be due to effects of prior drug exposure and could have implications for designing and interpreting clinical trials.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706168","annotations":[{"name":"Trastuzumab","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.766442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.741074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.724044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Metastatic breast cancer","weight":0.660287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_breast_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hormonal therapy (oncology)","weight":0.61634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_therapy_(oncology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.547152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.503506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.364608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.241591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.178263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"De novo synthesis","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo_synthesis"}]}
