{"id":77638,"title":"Occupational hazards in a public ambulance service.","abstract":"To identify the occupational risks in an ambulance service and to assess their impact on the health of employees.Two marched groups (number, sex, age, length of exposure) from two different work sectors were selected. A 60 item questionnaire was used. The 60 items were grouped into four categories related to work organization, work environment, neuropsychosensorial risk factors and health system and occupational safety-related risk factors and hazards. The data were statistically processed, significant correlations between the risk factors and the associated symptoms being found.Compared to the control group, significantly higher values (p<0.001) for work complexity, work environment factors, and organizational risk factors (walking on uneven ground, carrying weight, vicious postures) were found in ambulance service staff; cervical and lumbar spine problems were the most common complaints of ambulance service staff.The specific risk factors for ambulance service employees directly related to musculoskeletal disorders have been established.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502049","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.578346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.360491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.287715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.277528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Ambulance","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0439707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Emergency medical services","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Modern portfolio theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"}]}
