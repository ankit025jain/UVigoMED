{"id":36553,"title":"Congenital heart surgery outcome analysis: Indian experience.","abstract":"The study aimed to analyze the outcome of congenital heart surgery in a subset of Indian patients, using the Aristotle Basic Complexity score, the Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery categories, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery mortality categories.1312 patients <18 years of age undergoing congenital heart surgery were assigned the 3 scores and studied for outcome indices of difficulty (cardiopulmonary bypass time or duration of surgery >120?min), morbidity (intensive care unit stay >7 days), and mortality.The overall mortality was 6.85%, with mean a Aristotle Basic Complexity score, Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery category, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons and European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery mortality category of 7.17?±?2.04, 2.28?±?0.78, and 2.24?±?1.06, respectively. The mortality predictive capacity of the Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery category (c?=?0.76) was similar to that of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery mortality category (c?=?0.75); both were better compared to the Aristotle Basic Complexity score (c?=?0.66). The Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery category and Aristotle Basic Complexity score correlated with morbidity and difficulty outcomes.The study shows that the Aristotle Basic Complexity score, the Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery category, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery mortality category are tools of case mix stratification to analyze congenital heart surgery outcomes in a subset of the Indian population.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569325","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.924245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.739651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.709411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.631916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.619076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.426857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.370339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Aristotle","weight":0.277325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"name":"Cardiothoracic surgery","weight":0.204804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiothoracic_surgery"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.122184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"1312","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1312"},{"name":"241","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/241"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Basic life support","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_life_support"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
