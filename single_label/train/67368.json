{"id":67368,"title":"Update on cryoablation for treatment of small renal mass: oncologic control, renal function preservation, and rate of complications.","abstract":"Cryoablation has become a popular treatment option for the treatment of small renal masses (SRMs) in patients who are not ideal surgical candidates. This relatively new therapy continues to be studied in terms of its efficacy and safety. Intermediate- and long-term data published over the past year suggest comparable rates of oncological control for established extirpative options (partial and radical nephrectomy). Studies evaluating its safety profile show a decreased rate of major and minor complications, as compared with surgery. Cryoablation also offers excellent preservation of kidney function and is a viable treatment option in patients with preexisting renal compromise. The purpose of the present review is to summarize current literature on cryoablation therapy in the management of SRMs, with emphasis on studies published over the past year.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623576","annotations":[{"name":"Nephrectomy","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.550086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.515544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.370076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.0953293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Cryoablation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryoablation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Mass (liturgy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Major and minor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_and_minor"},{"name":"Historic preservation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_preservation"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Minor (law)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"}]}
