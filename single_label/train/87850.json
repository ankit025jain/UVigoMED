{"id":87850,"title":"Shoulder instability in older patients.","abstract":"Glenohumeral instability has a bimodal age distribution, with most affected patients younger than 40 years, but with a second peak in older patients. Glenohumeral dislocations in older patients often present with complex injury patterns, including rotator cuff tears, fractures, and neurovascular injuries. Glenohumeral instability in patients older than 40 years requires a different approach to treatment. An algorithmic approach aids the surgeon in the stepwise decision-making process necessary to treat this injury pattern.
