{"id":47435,"title":"Cytostatic conditioning in experimental allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: Busulfan causes less early gastrointestinal toxicity but Treosulfan results in improved immune reconstitution.","abstract":"Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the impact of the conditioning regimen on aGVHD comparing Treosulfan (Treo) and Busulfan (Bu) with total body irradiation (TBI).Using a haploidentical murine model, B6D2F1 mice conditioned with Bu (100?mg/kg)/Fludarabine (Flu, 500?mg/kg) or Treo (6000?mg/kg)/Flu (500?mg/kg) or TBI with 14?Gy received bone marrow cells and splenocytes (20?Ã—?10(6)) from either syngeneic (B6D2F1) or allogeneic (C57BL/6N) donors in order to analyze aGVHD outcome.Conditioning with Bu/Flu or Treo/Flu resulted in significantly reduced aGVHD severity and improved survival (p?<?0.05) after allo-BMT compared to TBI. On day 5 after allo-BMT, the organ damages of Bu/Flu conditioned animals were significantly reduced in association with diminished expression of tumor necrosis factor in serum compared to Treo/Flu. Interestingly, the early toxicity of Treo/Flu did not result in significantly higher aGVHD severity; furthermore, a significantly improved immune reconstitution of B220-positive B cells was observed at day 42 after Treo/Flu conditioning compared to Bu/Flu.Conditioning with Treo/Flu or Bu/Flu results in decreased aGVHD severity compared to TBI. Moreover, Treo/Flu was associated with improved immune reconstitution despite the early toxicity.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System
