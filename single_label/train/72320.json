{"id":72320,"title":"CGP74514A enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells by reducing X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein.","abstract":"Despite the selectivity of Tumor necrosis factor Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) for cancer cell killing activity, breast cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis for various reasons.From a functionally-characterized small-molecule dataset, CGP74514A was identified as a TRAIL sensitizer in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Combination of sub-toxic dose of TRAIL with CGP74514A was evaluated in three TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cells, MCF-7, T47D and SK-BR-3.In all tested cells, CGP74514A enhanced TRAIL sensitivity. Combination treatment triggered apoptotic events faster than single treatment. Regarding its mechanism of action, CGP74514A reduced cytosolic X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown experiments showed that reduction of XIAP is the reason of sensitization.CGP74514A sensitized breast cancer cells to TRAIL via reduction of XIAP expression level.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982369","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.638467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.607997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.539311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Ligand (biochemistry)","weight":0.530451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.496493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"MCF-7","weight":0.450618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCF-7"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.422829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.379314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Inhibitor of apoptosis","weight":0.362428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitor_of_apoptosis"},{"name":"XIAP","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XIAP"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Trail","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail"},{"name":"Sensitization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
