{"id":89879,"title":"[Fractures of the proximal humerus in the elderly : Osteosynthesis versus joint replacement].","abstract":"Expected changes in population demographics will have significant implications for society and health care provision for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures in the elderly.This article presents the incidence and clinical characteristics of geriatric fractures of the proximal humerus, a description of therapeutic options and treatment recommendations.The published scientific data were reviewed and current opinion available to guide patient care are presented.The majority of fractures of the proximal humerus that require operative treatment are amenable to reconstruction. Primary arthroplasty is usually reserved for comminuted fractures with delayed presentation, head-splitting fractures or those in which the humeral head is devoid of soft tissue attachments. Secondary replacement may be required in cases of fixation failure and symptomatic avascular necrosis.Decision-making is dependent on the fracture pattern as well as on patient and surgeon-related factors.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671346","annotations":[{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.841488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Joint replacement","weight":0.60838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_replacement"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.598597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.589279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.531202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.455046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.272222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Geriatrics","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0263793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
