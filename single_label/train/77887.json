{"id":77887,"title":"Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio: novel markers for diagnosis and prognosis in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.","abstract":"We aim to provide useful evidence about the association of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) and its possibility of emerging as a cheap, reliable, and independent prognostic marker of ISSNHL.348 patients diagnosed with ISSNHL were included in our retrospective data analysis. Blood samples and the hearing assessments of the patients were carried out. Then, the patients were divided into 2 groups as \"recovered\" and \"unrecovered\" according to their response to the treatment.Both mean NLR and PLR values of the ISSNHL patients were significantly higher than the control group (both P < 0.001). The NLR value was 5.98 ± 4.22 in the unrecovered group and 3.50 ± 3.38 in the recovered group (P < 0.001). After adjustment in a binary logistic regression model, only NLR value was associated with the recovery of ISSNHL (P = 0.001).We demonstrated for the first time that NLR and PLR values were significantly high in ISSNHL patients. Also the NLR level might be taken into account as a novel potential marker to predict the patients' prognosis in terms of recovery.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891755","annotations":[{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.754552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.455316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.356322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.285833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.266752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"North London Railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_Railway"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Home (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_(Angel)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
