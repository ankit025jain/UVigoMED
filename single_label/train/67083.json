{"id":67083,"title":"[Effectiveness of Vitaprost Plus in the treatment of patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis].","abstract":"The need for use of antimicrobial drugs in the treatment of patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis is indisputable. Given the variety of pathogenic mechanisms of chronic prostatitis, drug Vitaprost Plus in the form of rectal suppositories is of particular interest; it combines antibacterial activity with a positive effect on the various links in the pathogenesis of this disease. The evaluation of the efficacy and safety of drugs Vitaprost Plus and Lomflox was performed. Both groups showed a significant improvement in the NIH-CPSI score in summary and on individual domains; differences between groups were not statistically significant. The number of leukocytes in the prostatic exprimate decreased more markedly in the study group. Microbiological efficacy in the study group was 73.3%, in the control group--70%. Thus, the use of the drug Vitaprost Plus increased clinical and microbiological efficacy of treatment, which correlates with the data of previous studies.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649767","annotations":[{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.621885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Suppository","weight":0.554049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppository"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.519851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.393774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"}]}
