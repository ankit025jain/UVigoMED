{"id":55295,"title":"Visual outcomes of vitrectomy for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy-related breakthrough vitreous haemorrhage.","abstract":"To evaluate the long-term visual outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)-associated vitreous haemorrhage (VH).We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with PCV-related VH who underwent PPV. The main outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and fundus findings at 3 months postoperatively and final visit.Seventeen eyes of 17 patients with massive subretinal haemorrhage (16.7±7.1 disc size of mean subretinal haemorrhage area) were enrolled. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 25.2 months. Four eyes received intravitreal bevacizumab injections, and three eyes underwent photodynamic therapy before the onset of VH. The mean BCVA improved from logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) of 2.63±0.57 preoperatively to 1.43±0.82 at final visit (P<0.001). Among the eyes with initial polyps at subfoveal or juxtafoveal area, 16.70% achieved final BCVA ?20/400 (LogMAR 1.3), whereas 87.50% of eyes with initial polyps at extrafoveal area had final BCVA ?20/400 (Fisher's exact test, P=0.026).PCV with massive subretinal haemorrhage is at risk for breakthrough VH. The visual prognosis in eyes with PCV-related breakthrough VH is variable after vitrectomy. Initial polyps at the extrafoveal area led to better functional outcomes. Early vitrectomy may be beneficial for visual recovery after PCV-related VH.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924445","annotations":[{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.529118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.078616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Pars plana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_plana"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Photodynamic therapy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodynamic_therapy"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"Plana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plana"},{"name":"Optical resolution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution"},{"name":"Intravitreal administration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravitreal_administration"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Holden VH Commodore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_VH_Commodore"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Vitreous humour","weight":0.0104985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_humour"}]}
