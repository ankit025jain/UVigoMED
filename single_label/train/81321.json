{"id":81321,"title":"Effectiveness of Er:YAG laser in cavity preparation for retrograde filling--in vitro study.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the sealing quality of Super EBA cement in laser prepared root-end cavities in comparison with root-end cavities classically prepared with steel burrs. Two groups of three millimeter root sections were prepared. The first group was prepared with the Er:YAG laser and the second group with a steel burr mounted on a surgical handpiece. The sections were filled with Super EBA cement and tested for leakage with fluid transport techniques. The sealing quality of Super EBA cement in the classically prepared root-end cavities was better, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two preparation techniques. The possible reason for greater leakage in the laser prepared root-end cavities was probably the irregular shape of the root-end cavity.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163234","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.414229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Steel","weight":0.30633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.202159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.153296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Cement","weight":0.138084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0517203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Er (biblical person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Er_(biblical_person)"},{"name":"Seal (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Yttrium aluminium garnet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium_aluminium_garnet"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Reason","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Bur","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bur"}]}
