{"id":43816,"title":"[The Ogilvie syndrome in elderly patients with multimorbidity].","abstract":"Two patients presented with the Ogilvie syndrome which is an acute colonic pseudo-obstruction without any mechanical obstruction. Both patients suffered from multiple medical conditions such as infections, electrolyte disturbances and functional decline.The Ogilvie syndrome is particularly seen in patients with multimorbidity who stay in the hospital or nursing home. The incidence of the Ogilvie syndrome will probably increase because of ageing of our population and will be most prevalent in the frail elderly. The precise mechanism of this disease is still unclear, but there is evidence in the literature that the aetiology is multifactorial and runs via autonomic dysregulation of the colon.Early recognition and appropriate treatment may reduce the risk of complications and limit mortality, also depending on the related comorbidity.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24764153","annotations":[{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.73179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.600869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.58257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.574803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.507882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Nursing home","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.235517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Water-electrolyte imbalance","weight":0.0706647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water-electrolyte_imbalance"},{"name":"Frailty syndrome","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frailty_syndrome"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Intestinal pseudoobstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_pseudoobstruction"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"}]}
