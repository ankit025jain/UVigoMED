{"id":22380,"title":"[Effect of 3-oxypyridine and succinic acid derivatives on clinical manifestations of inflammatory diseases of the uterus and its appendages].","abstract":"Two-week-long, prospective, placebo-controlled, single-blind randomized study of the effects of intravenous emoxipin (150 mg daily), reamberin (400 ml daily) and mexidol (300 mg daily) infusion on the dynamics of clinical symptoms of non-complicated recrudescence of inflammatory diseases of the uterus and its appendages (IDUA) in comparison to the standard therapy was performed. It was established that emoxipin, reamberin and mexidol administration appreciably improved the clinical state dynamics of women with recrudescence of IDUA. The effect was associated with more pronounced decrease in severity of genital and abdominal symptoms versus standard therapy results.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555229","annotations":[{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.486358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.448105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.268362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.240999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Succinic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinic_acid"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Accessory visual structures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessory_visual_structures"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"},{"name":"Appendage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendage"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"}]}
