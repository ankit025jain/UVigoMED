{"id":91666,"title":"Clinical characteristics, etiologic associations, laboratory findings, treatment, and proposal of diagnostic criteria of pernio (chilblains) in a series of 104 patients at Mayo Clinic, 2000 to 2011.","abstract":"To further characterize the clinical features, etiologic associations, laboratory findings, and treatment of pernio.This is a retrospective review of patients with pernio seen at our institution between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2011.Of 104 patients with pernio (mean age at diagnosis, 38.3 years), 82 (79%) were women. Pernio affected the toes in 85 patients (82%) and the fingers in 31 (30%). Thirty-eight patients (37%) had at least 1 abnormal laboratory test result, and test results were positive for cold agglutinins in 11 (55%) of 20 tested patients. Results were negative for cryoglobulins in all tested patients (n=53). Four patients (4%) had connective tissue disease (nonlupus) associated with pernio; 3 patients (3%) had an associated hematologic malignant disease. Conservative treatments (eg, warming, drying, and smoking cessation) provided complete response in 23 (82%) of 28 patients with follow-up data.To our knowledge, this study represents one of the largest single-center case series of pernio to date. Most of the patients did not have an underlying systemic association with pernio, although a few patients had pernio in association with connective tissue disease or hematologic malignant disease.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485134","annotations":[{"name":"Mayo Clinic","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.788203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.784194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.764913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Smoking cessation","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.662989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.605583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.48582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.35922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.332822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.311587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Connective tissue disease","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue_disease"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.263112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Toe","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Chilblains","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilblains"},{"name":"Cryoglobulinemia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryoglobulinemia"},{"name":"Cold agglutinin disease","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_agglutinin_disease"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"January 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Agglutination (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination_(biology)"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Mayo GAA","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
