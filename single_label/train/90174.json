{"id":90174,"title":"Type III monteggia injury with ipsilateral type II Salter Harris injury of the distal radius and ulna in a child: a case report.","abstract":"Although previously reported, ipsilateral Monteggia fracture dislocation and distal radius fracture in a child is still a rare occurrence. A full clinical examination may be difficult but should not be ignored. Full length forearm radiographs are ideal but proper limb positioning may be difficult. The injury pattern can be easily missed.A five-year-old right hand dominant Caucasian male presented with a history of fall on outstretched hand. Clinical examination was difficult and X-rays confirmed type III Monteggia fracture with an ipsilateral Type II Salter Harris injury of the distal radius and ulna.This report highlights the need for relevant examination of the wrist and elbow in young children. Appropriate radiographs must also be performed to prevent missing these injuries.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642065","annotations":[{"name":"Ulna","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Monteggia fracture","weight":0.707166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteggia_fracture"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.650292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.617126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.563085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.467828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.370076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.204946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Distal radius fracture","weight":0.0953293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radius_fracture"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0408727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Grappling position","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling_position"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
