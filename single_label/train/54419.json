{"id":54419,"title":"Per magna-ovarian metastases from primary locally advanced colorectal cancer--a review of the literature with a description of three clinical cases.","abstract":"Krukenberg tumor is defined as metastatic lesions of gastrointestinal cancers. Several specific immunohistochemical methods can identify the main focus of malignant neoplasm. Ovarian metastases from colorectal cancer are rarely seen phenomenon. The authors examine in detail the literature on this issue and describe three own clinical cases of metachronous ovarian meta lesions in women undergoing surgery for locally advanced colorectal cancer--two of these metastases are unilateral, while one--bilateral established in a short time interval despite the casuistic nature of the pathology. One of the patients died in the early postoperative period of co-morbid complications unrelated to the underlying disease, and the other two monitoring continues during the adjuvant. Krukenberg-metastases from colorectal cancer occur in the blood-vascular pattern in time without damage to the left or right ovary. Metachronous development and operative treatment of ovarian metastases is far better prognosis of the cases with and operated simultaneously established metastases in the ovaries.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459765","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Krukenberg tumor","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krukenberg_tumor"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.780056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.535405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.529538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.197966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"}]}
