{"id":80772,"title":"Potential therapeutic use of herbal extracts in trypanosomiasis.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of crude extracts from Handroanthus impetiginosa, Ageratum conyzoides, and Ruta graveolens on Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi infection in vitro. The results showed that the extracts caused significant toxicity in promastigotes and trypomastigotes. A significant decrease in the rate of cell invasion by pretreated trypomastigotes and promastigotes was also observed. The extracts caused a significant reduction of the multiplication of intracellular amastigotes of both parasites. Therefore, these herbal extracts may be potential candidates for the development of drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.
