{"id":36890,"title":"Percutaneous transhepatic stenting of a restrictive atrial septal communication in hypoplastic left heart syndrome.","abstract":"The postnatal survival of patients with congenital cardiac defects such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is dependent on the patency of the ductus arteriosus and the presence of an unrestrictive atrial septal defect (ASD). We report a six week old infant with HLHS and tricuspid valve regurgitation with restrictive ASD. Transfemoral balloon atrial septostomy provided temporary relief but further attempts were not possible. A transhepatic venous approach to stent the atrial communication was technically successful. This approach may be the only access for certain infant cardiac catheterization interventions, permitting the use of a large delivery system (? 8 Fr).","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532371","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplastic_left_heart_syndrome"},{"name":"Atrial septal defect","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_septal_defect"},{"name":"Tricuspid valve","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_valve"},{"name":"Cardiac catheterization","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_catheterization"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Aortic insufficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_insufficiency"},{"name":"Ductus arteriosus","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Left heart","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_heart"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Hypoplasia","weight":0.693124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoplasia"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.674573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.569068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.537547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"}]}
