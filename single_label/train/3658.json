{"id":3658,"title":"Late effects of childhood cancer and its treatment.","abstract":"Treatment for childhood cancer with chemotherapy, radiation and/or hematopoietic cell transplant can result in adverse sequelae that may not become evident for many years. A clear understanding of the association between therapeutic exposures and specific long-term complications, and an understanding of the magnitude of the burden of morbidity borne by childhood cancer survivors, has led to the development of guidelines to support lifelong risk-based follow up for this population. It is important to develop interventions to reduce the impact of treatment-related late effects on morbidity and mortality and to continue research regarding the etiopathogenesis of therapy-related cancers and other late effects.
