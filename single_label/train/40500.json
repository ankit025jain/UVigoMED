{"id":40500,"title":"Neuron-specific enolase in the intestinal wall in Crohn´s disease.","abstract":"The authors described the localization of neuron-specific enolase in the intestinal wall in Crohn´s disease. We have used samples obtained by biopsy from the colon lining of five people affected by Crohn's disease for our examination. We have processed samples using the formol paraffin technique. From paraffin blocks, we have prepared histological sections approximately 5 ?m thick. For immunohistochemic examinations, we have revitalised the sections by acquiring the heat-induced epitope. We detected NSE by monoclonal mouse antibodies against human neuron-specific enolase, clone BBS/NC/VI-H14 (DakoCytomation, Denmark) (Fig. 4, Ref. 7).","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25023431","annotations":[{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Crohn's disease","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn's_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.789375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Formaldehyde","weight":0.65048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.648143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.443093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Paraffin","weight":0.375442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.362482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Ficus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"National Stock Exchange of India","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Stock_Exchange_of_India"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Enolase","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enolase"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
