{"id":80875,"title":"Hepatic cystic echinococcosis: percutaneous treatment as an outpatient procedure.","abstract":"To demonstrate utility and safety of the puncture aspiration injection and reaspiration (PAIR) technique for outpatients.Percutaneous treatment with US guidance was applied to 33 patients for 44 cysts. Patients treated with the PAIR technique, were outpatients. PAIR and catheterization technique were evaluated for efficacy and safety of procedure and complication rates.Thirty-five of 44 cysts were treated with the PAIR and 9 of 44 were treated with the catheterization technique. The success rate of the cysts Gharbi type 1 (CE1) and type 2 (CE3a) treated with the PAIR technique was 100%. In the follow up of 9 cysts treated with the catheterization technique, 2 of them (22%) developed cyst infection and 1 (11%) developed a biliary fistula.The PAIR technique was found to be an effective and safe approach in order to treat Gharbi type 1 and type 2 cysts percutaneously for outpatients. It has a very low complication rate in comparison with the catheterization technique. So every effort should be made to finish the treatment with PAIR technique.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507642","annotations":[{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.682075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.633026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.538962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.465075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.192337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Biliary fistula","weight":0.119639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliary_fistula"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Common Era","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era"},{"name":"1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Gharbi, Tunisia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharbi,_Tunisia"}]}
