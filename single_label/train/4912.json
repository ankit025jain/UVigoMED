{"id":4912,"title":"[Promising approaches of antiviral therapy of hemorrhagic fevers].","abstract":"Acceptable means of therapy and prophylaxis for most of the especially dangerous viral hemorrhagic fevers to present date are lacking. Analysis of the state of this problem shows that creation of a new generation of etiotropic preparations requires selection of additional targets for their effect that may be based on the use of molecular-biological features of pathogenesis of these infections. Literature data analysis has shown that during filovirus infection non-structural and structural proteins of the causative agents serve as pathogens during direct damaging effect of the virus and secondary immune reactions that in general pervert cell and humoral components of immunity converting its destructive effect on cells and tissues of the macro organism. Selection of promising approaches of antiviral therapy is possible based on molecular-biological analysis of interaction of micro- and macro organism with isolation of the most vulnerable for the effect of causative agent aggression factors.","date":"2014-10-07","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286519","annotations":[{"name":"Filoviridae","weight":0.827477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filoviridae"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.755699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Viral hemorrhagic fever","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hemorrhagic_fever"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.598826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.30308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Viral nonstructural protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_nonstructural_protein"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"}]}
