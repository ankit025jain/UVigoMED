{"id":55523,"title":"[Results of fistulizing and Ahmed valve surgery for treatment of refractory glaucoma].","abstract":"Surgical results of 76 patients (76 eyes) aged 25-79 years with secondary refractory glaucoma were analyzed. The best hypotensive effect and visual functions integrity were achieved with Ahmed valve implantation (86.7% and 83.3% of cases respectively); after conventional fistulizing surgery the hypotensive effect was observed in 45.5%, noncompromised vision--in 54.5% of cases. Tunnel trabeculectomy with iridocycloretraction led to normalization of intraocular pressure and stabilization of visual functions in 81.3% and 68.8% of cases respectively and thus can be considered as an alternative to fistulizing surgery in patients with secondary refractory glaucoma. Uveal glaucoma is a relative contraindication to Ahmed valve implantation, while neovascular glaucoma is that to tunnel trabeculectomy with iridocycloretraction.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864493","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.788616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.635552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.434906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.355601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.32051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.250358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.125893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Neovascular glaucoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascular_glaucoma"},{"name":"Trabeculectomy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabeculectomy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Annealing (metallurgy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)"},{"name":"ABC (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
