{"id":15853,"title":"HMBPP-deficient Listeria mutant immunization alters pulmonary/systemic responses, effector functions, and memory polarization of V?2V?2 T cells.","abstract":"Whereas infection or immunization of humans/primates with microbes coproducing HMBPP/IPP can remarkably activate V?2V?2 T cells, in vivo studies have not been done to dissect HMBPP- and IPP-driven expansion, pulmonary trafficking, effector functions, and memory polarization of V?2V?2 T cells. We define these phosphoantigen-host interplays by comparative immunizations of macaques with the HMBPP/IPP-coproducing Listeria ?actA prfA* and HMBPP-deficient Listeria ?actA ?GCPE: prfA* mutant. The HMBPP-deficient ?GCPE: mutant shows lower ability to expand V?2V?2 T cells in vitro than the parental HMBPP-producing strain but displays comparably attenuated infectivity or immunogenicity. Respiratory immunization of macaques with the HMBPP-deficient mutant elicits lower pulmonary and systemic responses of V?2V?2 T cells compared with the HMBPP-producing vaccine strain. Interestingly, HMBPP-deficient mutant reimmunization or boosting elicits enhanced responses of V?2V?2 T cells, but the magnitude is lower than that by HMBPP-producing listeria. HMBPP-deficient listeria differentiated fewer V?2V?2 T effector cells capable of coproducing IFN-? and TNF-? and inhibiting intracellular listeria than HMBPP-producing listeria. Furthermore, HMBPP deficiency in listerial immunization influences memory polarization of V?2V?2 T cells. Thus, both HMBPP and IPP production in listerial immunization or infection elicit systemic/pulmonary responses and differentiation of V?2V?2 T cells, but a role for HMBPP is more dominant. Findings may help devise immune intervention.
