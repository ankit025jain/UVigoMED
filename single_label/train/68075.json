{"id":68075,"title":"[Sensitivity to change of the USP score (Urinary Symptoms Profile) after surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)].","abstract":"To evaluate the sensitivity to change in USP score (Urinary Symptoms Profile) after surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).Prospective study collecting IPSS (International Prostatic Symptom Score) and USP scores before and 6 weeks after surgery for BPH. Sensitivity to change was assessed using effect size (ES) and mean standardized response (MSR).Thirty patients, mean age of 68Â±10 years (min: 52, max: 90) were included in this study. The mean IPSS and USP scores were 14.3 (e.t.: 5.42), 20.3 (e.t.: 5.22) and 3.53 (e.t.: 3.68), 3.43 (e.t.: 3.48) before and after surgery respectively. The overall USP score showed excellent sensitivity to change with a global value of ES and MSR of 1.986 and 2.322 respectively.The USP score has an excellent sensitivity to change. It seems to be a valid and reliable score that can be perfectly adapted to the assessment of symptoms associated with BPH, with good sensitivity to changes in the overall score, with the advantage over the IPSS of an exhaustive exploration of all urinary symptoms particularly in the field of urge urinary incontinence and stress urinary incontinence.4.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560291","annotations":[{"name":"Benign prostatic hyperplasia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.730688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.705308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Effect size","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"},{"name":"United States Pharmacopeia","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Pharmacopeia"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Not Fade Away (Angel)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Fade_Away_(Angel)"}]}
