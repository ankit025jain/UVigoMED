{"id":83155,"title":"Topical application of drugs used in treatment of oral lichen planus lesions.","abstract":"Oral lichen planus is a common, chronic mucosal disease associated with a cell-mediated immunological dysfunction. The clinical manifestation is different when various forms, white and red, are considered. Erosive, atrophic, ulcerative lesions require long-term treatment, because of inflammation and severe pain. Since the etiology is still unknown this symptomatic OLP lesions are not curative. The effectiveness of various modalities applied in topical OLP treatment is presented on the basis of the current literature. This treatment in most cases is palliative because of OLP recalcitrant nature. Described agents such: steroids, immunosupressants, aloe vera, hyaluronic acid, antifungal showed beneficial effects. They enhance healing, improve signs and symptoms of lesions and thus improve the quality of patients' life. Topical treatment is recommended mainly because of minimal side-effects.
