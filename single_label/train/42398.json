{"id":42398,"title":"The novel HDAC inhibitor OBP-801/YM753 enhances the effects of 5-fluorouracil with radiation on esophageal squamous carcinoma cells.","abstract":"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown to enhance the effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) against various cancer cells; however, no report has shown that an HDAC inhibitor may enhance the effects of 5-FU with radiation. Therefore, we investigated whether the novel HDAC inhibitor OBP-801/YM753 could enhance the effects of 5-FU with radiation on esophageal squamous carcinoma KYSE170 cells. The inhibition of the cell growth was significantly stronger with the combination of OBP-801/YM753 with 5-FU than with the 5-FU treatment only. Furthermore, inhibition of the colony formation was the most effective with the combined treatment of OBP-801/YM753, 5-FU, and radiation. Western blot analysis showed that OBP-801/YM753 suppressed the expression of thymidylate synthase induced by 5-FU. Therefore, this three-combined therapy is promising for patients with esophageal squamous carcinoma.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854104","annotations":[{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.934224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Histone deacetylase inhibitor","weight":0.842154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.772527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Histone deacetylase","weight":0.767134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.634572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.538962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.412277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acetylation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.190315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"On-base percentage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage"},{"name":"Thymidylate synthase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidylate_synthase"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"753","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/753"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Professional wrestling throws","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws"},{"name":"Thymidine monophosphate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymidine_monophosphate"},{"name":"YM (magazine)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YM_(magazine)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
