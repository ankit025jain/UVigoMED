{"id":31248,"title":"Pattern and associated factors of anti-hepatitis C virus treatment-induced adverse reactions.","abstract":"To assess the pattern and possible risk factors of conventional and/or pegylated interferon alpha (IFN-?) plus ribavirin therapy for causing adverse reactions in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus. Patients attending a referral center in Iran were assessed.During an 18 month period all adult individuals diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus who planned to receive anti-hepatitis C virus treatment were prospectively screened regarding all related subjective and objective adverse drug reactions.The number of adverse drug reactions were significantly associated with the number of concomitant medications (p < 0.001), female gender (p = 0.027), increased age (p = 0.001), pegylated IFN-? (p = 0.015) and hepatitis C virus genotype 1 (p = 0.002). History of a prior anti-hepatitis C virus treatment course (OR = 3.081, 95% CI = 1.174 - 6.085; p = 0.022) and the number of co-administered medications (OR = 1.165, 95% CI = 1.034 - 1.314; p = 0.012) were identified as the only statistically significant risk factors for developing anti-hepatitis C virus medication-related psychiatric and dermatologic adverse reactions, respectively.These data could be exploited by health-care professionals and policy makers as a guide for developing optimal educational and preventive strategies in the setting of anti-hepatitis C virus medication safety.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24386997","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis
