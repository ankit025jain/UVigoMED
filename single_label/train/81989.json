{"id":81989,"title":"Crevicular and serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-4 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in periodontal health and disease.","abstract":"Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are involved in destruction of the periodontal structures. The aim of this study is to determine the presence of MCP-4 and high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and serum in periodontal health and disease and to find a correlation between MCP-4 and hsCRP in GCF and serum.40 subjects (20 males and 20 females) were selected and divided into three groups based on clinical parameters and radiologic parameters: Group 1 (10 healthy); Group 2 (15 gingivitis subjects) and Group 3 (15 chronic periodontitis subjects). The levels of serum and GCF MCP-4 were determined by ELISA and hsCRP levels were determined by immunoturbidimetry method.The mean GCF and serum concentration of MCP-4 were the highest for group 3 followed by group 2 and least in group 1. Similarly, the mean hsCRP concentrations were highest for group 3 and least in group 1. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found between serum and GCF MCP-4 and hsCRP levels and periodontal parameters.The levels of MCP-4 and hsCRP increased from healthy to periodontitis. It can be proposed that MCP-4 and hsCRP are the potential biomarkers of inflammation in periodontal health and disease.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751778","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.890718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.848747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.694376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.640654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.633497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.395432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.381049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.145853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.124614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Gingival sulcus","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_sulcus"},{"name":"Chronic periodontitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Global Certification Forum","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Certification_Forum"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"}]}
