{"id":71086,"title":"The mechanism of honokiol-induced intracellular Ca(2+) rises and apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells.","abstract":"Honokiol, an active constituent of oriental medicinal herb Magnolia officinalis, caused Ca(2+) mobilization and apoptosis in different cancer cells. In vivo, honokiol crossed the blood-brain or -cerebrospinal fluid barrier, suggesting that it may be an effective drug for the treatment of brain tumors, including glioblastoma. This study examined the effect of honokiol on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and apoptosis in DBTRG-05MG human glioblastoma cells. Honokiol concentration-dependently induced a [Ca(2+)]i rise. The signal was decreased partially by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). Honokiol-triggered [Ca(2+)]i rise was not suppressed by store-operated Ca(2+) channel blockers (nifedipine, econazole, SK&F96365) and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA), but was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. GF109203X-induced inhibition was not altered by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). In Ca(2+)-free medium, pretreatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) or 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) abolished honokiol-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. Conversely, incubation with honokiol abolished TG or BHQ-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 abolished honokiol-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise. Honokiol (20-80?M) reduced the cell viability, which was not reversed by prechelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester). Honokiol (20-60?M) enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, released cytochrome c, and activated caspase-9/caspase-3. Together, honokiol induced a [Ca(2+)]i rise by inducing PLC-dependent Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+) entry via PKC-dependent, non store-operated Ca(2+) channels. Moreover, honokiol activated the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in DBTRG-05MG human glioblastoma cells.
