{"id":82640,"title":"Erosion protection comparison of stabilised SnF2 , mixed fluoride active and SMFP/arginine-containing dentifrices.","abstract":"To investigate the relative erosion protection potential of marketed dentifrices formulated with either stabilised stannous fluoride (SnF2 ), sodium fluoride (NaF) and/or sodium monofluorophosphate (SMFP) using an established laboratory erosion cycling model.Sound enamel cores from extracted, human enamel were cleaned, ground and polished, soaked in pooled saliva (pellicle formation) and treated with a 1:3 slurry of dentifrice and saliva. Specimens were subjected to daily challenges with 1% citric acid, a potentially damaging acid found in common food and drinks. Marketed dentifrices compared were: (1) a stabilised stannous fluoride product formulated with 1,100 ppm F as SnF2 ; (2) a cavity protection product containing 1,100 ppm F as NaF; (3) a cavity protection product comprising a mixed active fluoride system with 1,000 ppm F as SMFP + 450 ppm F as NaF; and (4) a sensitivity product containing 1,450 ppm F as SMFP + 8% arginine bicarbonate.Specimens from Group 1 demonstrated an average loss of 5.5 (±1.2) ?m of tooth surface enamel; Groups 2, 3 and 4 lost an average of 18.3 (±0.9) ?m, 16.0 (±2.0) ?m and 17.1 (±1.1) ?m, respectively, of tooth surface enamel. Group 1 provided a statistically significant difference in protection compared with the other products.These results suggest that the marketed dentifrice formulated with stabilised SnF2 may provide enhanced protection of exposed tooth surfaces against dietary acid attack compared with the other products tested.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571701","annotations":[{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.867714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.806779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Parts-per notation","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts-per_notation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Tooth enamel","weight":0.713603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Bicarbonate","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate"},{"name":"Sodium fluoride","weight":0.639173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.629272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.61719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Citric acid","weight":0.569069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.423625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.314772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Sodium monofluorophosphate","weight":0.182246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_monofluorophosphate"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Tin(II) fluoride","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_fluoride"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Acid throwing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_throwing"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Dentifrice","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentifrice"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Polishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polishing"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Tin(II) chloride","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_chloride"},{"name":"Fabrication and testing of optical components","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrication_and_testing_of_optical_components"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Cycling","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Slurry","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry"}]}
