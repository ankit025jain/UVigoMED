{"id":72291,"title":"Adaptive dose-finding studies: a review of model-guided phase I clinical trials.","abstract":"We provide a comprehensive review of adaptive phase I clinical trials in oncology that used a statistical model to guide dose escalation to identify the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). We describe the clinical setting, practical implications, and safety of such applications, with the aim of understanding how these designs work in practice.We identified 53 phase I trials published between January 2003 and September 2013 that used the continual reassessment method (CRM), CRM using escalation with overdose control, or time-to-event CRM for late-onset toxicities. Study characteristics, design parameters, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) definition, DLT rate, patient-dose allocation, overdose, underdose, sample size, and trial duration were abstracted from each study. In addition, we examined all studies in terms of safety, and we outlined the reasons why escalations occur and under what circumstances.On average, trials accrued 25 to 35 patients over a 2-year period and tested five dose levels. The average DLT rate was 18%, which is lower than in previous reports, whereas all levels above the MTD had an average DLT rate of 36%. On average, 39% of patients were treated at the MTD, and 74% were treated at either the MTD or an adjacent level (one level above or below).This review of completed phase I studies confirms the safety and generalizability of model-guided, adaptive dose-escalation designs, and it provides an approach for using, interpreting, and understanding such designs to guide dose escalation in phase I trials.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982451","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.541241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.371348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Drug overdose","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.157091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0181577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Escalation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Trauma center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center"},{"name":"Generalizability theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizability_theory"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"In phase","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_phase"},{"name":"Abstraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Language interpretation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Customer relationship management","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management"}]}
