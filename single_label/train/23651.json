{"id":23651,"title":"Colonic immunopathogenesis of Clostridium difficile infections.","abstract":"There are major gaps in our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs). In this study, 36 different biomarkers were examined in the stools of CDI and non-CDI patients using the Proteome Profiler human cytokine array assay and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Diarrheal stools from patients with CDI (CDI-positive diarrheal stools) showed higher relative amounts of the following inflammatory markers than the diarrheal stools from CDI-negative patients (CDI-negative diarrheal stools): C5a, CD40L, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, I-309, interleukin-13 (IL-13), IL-16, IL-27, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-8. IL-8 and IL-23 were present in a larger number of CDI-positive diarrheal stools than CDI-negative diarrheal stools. Th1 and Th2 cytokines were not significantly different between the CDI-positive and CDI-negative diarrheal stools. Lactoferrin and calprotectin concentrations were also higher in the CDI-positive diarrheal stools. Our results demonstrate that CDI elicits a proinflammatory host response, and we report for the first time that IL-23 is a major marker in CDI-positive diarrheal stools. IL-23 may explain the lack of a robust immunological response exhibited by a proportion of CDI patients and may relate to recurrence; the IL-23 levels induced during CDI in these patients may be inadequate to sustain the cellular immunity conferred by this cytokine in promoting the induction and proliferation of effector memory T cells.
