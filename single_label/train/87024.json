{"id":87024,"title":"[Research of suppression of the herpes simplex virus reproduction with drug resistance using a combination 15-Lys-bis-Nt with some antiherpetic drugs].","abstract":"The antiviral effect of combinations of netropsin derivative 15-Lys-bis-Nt with the known antiherpetic compounds, whose activity does not depend on viral TK and which are able to inhibit replication of HSV in most cases, including strains resistant to acyclovir and pencyclovir, was studied. The combinations evoking additive, synergistic and significant synergistic effects of interaction of tested compounds were observed. The results obtained in this work indicated the possibility of significant reduction of concentrations of high toxic compounds in case of the combined use.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065145","annotations":[{"name":"Aciclovir","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aciclovir"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.730629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.699238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.544856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.529057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.255832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"}]}
