{"id":55090,"title":"Tocilizumab in uveitis refractory to other biologic drugs: a study of 3 cases and a literature review.","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical response to Tocilizumab (TCZ) in three patients with non-infectious uveitis refractory to anti-TNF-? drugs.Assessment of TCZ-treated patients with immune-mediated uveitis from two Spanish medical referral centers. Uveitis had been refractory to previous standard synthetic immunosuppressive drugs and at least one TNF-? inhibitor. A literature review of patients with immune-mediated uveitis treated with TCZ therapy was also conducted.3 women (5 eyes) with uveitis refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy and at least one anti-TNF-? drug were treated with TCZ. The mean age of the patients was 48.6±16.1 (range 37-67) years. In two cases uveitis was bilateral and in the other unilateral. The underlying diseases were rheumatoid arthritis in one case and Behçet's disease in the other two cases. After a mean follow-up of 7.3±5.7 (range 1-12) months using TCZ therapy, all patients experienced ocular improvement. Also, in 3 eyes inactive intraocular inflammation was achieved. None of the patients had side effects during the period of treatment with this drug. A literature review disclosed that our observations are in keeping with other reports that showed good response to TCZ in 11 of 12 patients with immune-mediated uveitis refractory to other biologic agents.TCZ appears to be an effective and safe therapy for the management of patients with uveitis refractory to other biologic drugs.","date":"2014-10-01","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005576","annotations":[{"name":"TNF inhibitor","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNF_inhibitor"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.751777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.742102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Biologic","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologic"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.666252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.635388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.486111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.468795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.203192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.129987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Tocilizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocilizumab"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"}]}
