{"id":87155,"title":"Simple, illustrated medicines information improves ARV knowledge and patient self-efficacy in limited literacy South African HIV patients.","abstract":"Few studies have investigated antiretroviral (ARV) knowledge and self-efficacy in limited literacy patients. Using a randomized controlled study design, we investigated the influence of a simple pre-tested patient information leaflet (PIL) containing both text and illustrations on HIV- and ARV-related knowledge and on self-efficacy over six months in a limited literacy African population. The recruited patients were randomly allocated to either control (standard care) or intervention group (standard care plus illustrated PIL). HIV and medicines-related knowledge was evaluated with a 22-question test at baseline, one, three, and six months. Self-efficacy was assessed using a modified version of the HIV Treatment Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale. Two-thirds of the patients were female, mean age was 39.0 ± 9.6 years and mean education was 7.3 ± 2.8 years. Patients who received the PIL showed a significant knowledge increase over the six-month period (62.0-94.4%), with improvement at each subsequent interview whereas the control group showed no improvement. At baseline, side effect knowledge was the lowest (50-56%) but increased in the intervention group to 92%. Similarly, other medicine-related knowledge at baseline (57-67%) improved significantly (93%) and was sustained over six months. Cohen's d values post-baseline ranged between 1.36 and 2.18, indicating a large intervention effect. Self-efficacy improved significantly over six months in intervention but not control patients. At baseline, patients with ? 3 years of education had lower knowledge and self-efficacy but this was not observed post-intervention, which we attribute to the PIL mitigating the effect of limited education. Knowledge and self-efficacy were significantly correlated in the intervention group. In conclusion, a low-cost intervention of a well-designed, pre-tested, simple, illustrated PIL significantly increased both ARV knowledge and self-efficacy in HIV patients with limited education.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975116","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.590116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Literacy","weight":0.413912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.379468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.35839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.274485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.163172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.153002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Clinical study design","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_study_design"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Illustration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustration"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.019427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Leaflet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaflet"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"}]}
