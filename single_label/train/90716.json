{"id":90716,"title":"Mild traumatic brain injury after motor vehicle collisions: what are the symptoms and who treats them? A population-based 1-year inception cohort study.","abstract":"To describe the 1-year course of symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) sustained in a motor vehicle collision as well as patterns of care-seeking.One-year follow-up of a population-based inception cohort.The province of Saskatchewan, Canada, with a population of about 1,000,000 inhabitants.Persons (N=1716) sustaining an MTBI during a car collision between November 1997 and December 1999.Not applicable.We report the prevalence of sleep disturbances, tiredness, dizziness, forgetfulness, vision problems, hearing problems, headache, neck pain, mid back pain, and low back pain at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postcollision. At the same time points, we report self-reported care-seeking from registered health care professionals.A total of 1716 adults suffered MTBI after a motor vehicle collision over the 2-year inception period. Six weeks after the collision, 75% reported having more than 3 symptoms and 30% had clinically significant pain in more than 3 body sites. Over time, the prevalence of symptoms and pain decreased but they were still common after 1 year. Almost all participants sought care for their symptoms at all time points, most commonly from a physician. Care-seeking from physiotherapists, chiropractors, and massage therapists was also very common, and most participants sought care from 2 or 3 providers at all follow-up points.Up to 1 year after sustaining an MTBI during a motor vehicle collision, multiple symptoms and pain in several anatomical sites are common. Care-seeking from multiple providers continues throughout the first year postinjury.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581914","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.815511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Dizziness","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Chiropractic","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Canada","weight":0.751267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Low back pain","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.558909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.529262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.500992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Massage","weight":0.326483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.311533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.309553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Saskatchewan","weight":0.267656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan"},{"name":"Motor vehicle","weight":0.196702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0533769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Neck pain","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_pain"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"Collision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Forgetting","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}]}
