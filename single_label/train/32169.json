{"id":32169,"title":"Swimmer syndrome in a clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) cub.","abstract":"A 32-day-old, hand-reared, captive-born female clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) cub presented as being unable to stand, ambulate, or adduct both hind limbs. The cub exhibited hyperextension of both tarsal joints and a flattened thorax, which limited mobility to \"swimmer-like\" movements. Neither congenital defects nor neurologic deficits were observed during the medical examination. Radiographic examination showed the thorax was compressed dorsoventrally, but no other skeletal abnormalities were detected. Based on clinical signs, the condition was more consistent with swimmer syndrome, which has been described in young offspring of several domestic species. Over the course of 3 wk, affected limbs were treated by intensive physiotherapy, corrective bandages were applied, and thermotherapy was used to improve circulation, which resulted in a complete recovery and development of subsequent normal ambulation. It is concluded that early diagnosis and treatment of this condition led to the resolution of clinical signs, resulting in normal development of the clouded leopard cub reported here.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
