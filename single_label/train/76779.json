{"id":76779,"title":"Three distinct clustering patterns in metabolic syndrome abnormalities are differentially associated with dietary factors in Korean adults.","abstract":"Dietary factors are not consistently associated with metabolic syndrome abnormalities. In this cross-sectional study, we hypothesized that distinct clustering patterns exist in metabolic syndrome abnormalities and that those patterns are differentially associated with dietary factors. To test this hypothesis, we examined distinct clustering patterns of metabolic syndrome abnormalities and their association with dietary factors in Korean adults. A total of 141 subjects were recruited through the Family Medicine Division of the General Hospital in Seoul. Subjects who had complete data on waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid indicators, and no medication usage were included in this study. Dietary intake data were obtained by multiple 24-hour recalls (2-4 days) through on-site or telephone interviews. To identify clustering patterns of metabolic syndrome abnormalities, factor analysis was used for waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Three distinct clustering patterns were identified: (1) high blood pressure, (2) dyslipidemia, and (3) high blood glucose. The high blood pressure pattern was significantly associated with higher alcohol intake and lower carbohydrate intake. The dyslipidemia pattern was significantly associated with a diet of high glycemic index and glycemic load. The high blood glucose pattern was associated with lower carbohydrate intake. Metabolic syndrome abnormalities had 3 distinct clustering patterns independently associated with dietary factors. Diets with high glycemic index and glycemic load were strongly linked with the dyslipidemia pattern, and high alcohol intake was linked with the high blood pressure pattern in Korean adults.
