{"id":75792,"title":"[Verbal fluency tasks II. Investigation of the Hungarian version of the semantic fluency task between 5 and 89 years of age].","abstract":"The semantic fluency task is a widely used neuropsychological tool to assess lexico-semantic and executive functions related to fronto-temporal circuits. We investigated the Hungarian version of the semantic fluency task across lifespan, between 5 and 89 years of age (N=562). In the semantic fluency task the participants are asked to generate as many words as possible in 1 minute in a given category (animals, fruits, supermarket products). We analyzed classical scores such as number of words, perseverations and errors. Moreover we evaluated complex indices such as number of clusters, cluster size, total switches and cluster switches. We present the age-related and sex differences in the above mentioned indices. This tool pack could help in a more detailed characterization of cognitive functions in psychiatric and neurological disorders.
