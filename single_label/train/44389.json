{"id":44389,"title":"The gross classification of hepatocellular carcinoma: usefulness of contrast-enhanced US.","abstract":"This study investigated the usefulness of postvascular images of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CE-US) in the gross classification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) findings.This is a prospective study with consecutive HCC patients who had both CE-US and CE-CT prior to surgical resection. Fifty-one patients (32 men, 19 women; mean age, 68.9 years) with 61 HCCs were enrolled. The maximal diameters of all tumors ranged from 1.0 to 5.0 cm (mean?±?SD, 2.5 cm?±?1.1). Weighted kappa statistics were used to assess the agreement of the sonographic or CT findings versus the results of macroscopic configurations.Thirty-nine tumors were macroscopically diagnosed as simple nodule type; 19 tumors were macroscopically diagnosed as simple nodular type with extranodular growth, and 3 were macroscopically diagnosed as confluent multinodular type from the resected specimen. The diagnostic accuracy was 86.9% (53/61) for CE-US and 65.6% (40/61) for CE-CT. The differences in accuracy between CE-US and CE-CT were statistically significant (McNemar; p?=?0.007). Agreement analysis between gross classification using CE-US and final macroscopic results gave a kappa value of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65–0.82), which was considered a good agreement. On the other hand, kappa coefficient value was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.28–0.48) between gross classification using CE-CT and final macroscopic results.CE-US is a more reliable tool than CE-CT to evaluate the gross type of HCC than CE-CT. Accurate gross classification using imaging is considered to be essential for the determination of the correct treatment strategy and the estimates of the patients' prognosis.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738129","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.799994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.659065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.27274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.230354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Cohen's kappa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen's_kappa"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"650","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/650"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Confluence (abstract rewriting)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(abstract_rewriting)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"},{"name":"Kappa (folklore)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_(folklore)"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
