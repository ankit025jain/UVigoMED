{"id":46396,"title":"Hepatic arterial infusion therapy in advanced cancer and liver-predominant disease: the MD Anderson Experience.","abstract":"Liver metastases in patients with cancer are associated with a poor prognosis. We assessed the clinical outcomes in patients with advanced cancer and predominant liver involvement treated on hepatic arterial infusion (HAI chemotherapy protocols.We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of patients referred to the Phase I Clinical Trials Program between April 2004 and September 2009.Overall, 202 consecutive patients were identified. Of 189 evaluable patients, the rates of partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) >4 months were 6.3% and 23%, respectively. In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma (n = 15), 5 (33%) had SD ? 4 months. In patients with colorectal cancer (n = 67) treated with HAl oxaliplatin or irinotecan combination therapy, the rates of PR and SD ? 4 months were 7.5% and 34.3%, respectively. In patients with breast cancer (n = 17) treated with HAI cisplatin-based therapy, the rates of PR and SD -4 months were 17.6% and 35.3%, respectively. The median survival of patients with PR and SD ? 4 months was 11.6 months. Independent factors predicting shorter survival were male gender; decreased albumin and hemogloblin; and elevated bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase.HAI combination therapies have antitumor activity in selected heavily pretreated patients with certain tumor types and liver involvement.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634931","annotations":[{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Cholangiocarcinoma","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Irinotecan","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.746414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.619187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.599399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.557288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.536616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.174966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"The Independent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent"},{"name":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_MD_Anderson_Cancer_Center"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"}]}
