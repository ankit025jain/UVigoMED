{"id":46580,"title":"Influence of obesity on the correlation between laryngopharyngeal reflux and obstructive sleep apnea.","abstract":"The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by recurrent episodes of partial or total obstruction of the upper airway lasting more than 10 seconds during sleep. Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is a variant of the disease Gastroesophageal Reflux that affects the larynx and pharynx.Evaluate the influence of obesity on the relationship between RFL and OSAS in patients with OSA.An observational retrospective cross. We reviewed care protocol for patients with OSA that includes validated questionnaires for RFL as Sympton Reflux Index (RSI) and Reflux Finding Score (RSI), and polysomnography nasolaringofibroscopia.105 patients were divided into obese group (39 patients) and non-obese patients (66 patients). In the evaluation of the mean RSI group of non-obese was similar between patients with mild OSA (11.96) and moderate (11.43). In the obese group the mean RSI was 6.7 in patients with mild OSA and 11.53 in patients with moderate to severe OSA (p < 0.05).The subgroup of patients with OSA and RFL have several factors that promote inflammation of the upper airway. Patients with OSA should be screened and treated as the RFL increasing the quality of life.The RFL are positively correlated and OSAS in obese patients.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626885","annotations":[{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.837309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.75392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.752514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.743735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.654841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.417093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Laryngopharyngeal reflux","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngopharyngeal_reflux"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.150837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"League of Polish Families","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Polish_Families"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Repetitive strain injury","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury"},{"name":"Rugby Football League","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_Football_League"}]}
