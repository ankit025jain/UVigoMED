{"id":85771,"title":"Increased levels of plasma CXC-Chemokine Ligand 10, 12 and 16 are associated with right ventricular function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.","abstract":"To investigate plasma levels of CXC-Chemokine Ligand 10 (CXCL10), CXC-Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12) and CXC-Chemokine Ligand 16 (CXCL16) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).Plasma levels of biomarkers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 61 patients with IPAH and 20 healthy volunteers.Plasma CXCL10, CXCL12 and CXCL16 concentrations were increased significantly in IPAH patients compared with controls, and significantly correlated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, tricuspid annulus plane systolic excursion and right ventricular ejection fraction.Increased levels of CXCL10, CXCL12 and CXCL16 are associated with right ventricular dysfunction in patients with IPAH.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856224","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.740903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.703829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.666094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.643726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Tricuspid valve","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_valve"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.581051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.497171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Stromal cell-derived factor-1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell-derived_factor-1"},{"name":"CXCL10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL10"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Excursion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excursion"},{"name":"Natriuretic peptide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natriuretic_peptide"},{"name":"Plane (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"}]}
