{"id":68045,"title":"Intrathecal chloroprocaine vs. lidocaine in day-case surgery: recovery, discharge and effect of pre-hydration on micturition.","abstract":"This randomised, double blind prospective study compares intrathecal lidocaine with chloroprocaine in day-case surgery and the influence of a 500 ml pre-load intravenously. We tested the hypothesis that chloroprocaine provides faster recovery and discharge in day-case surgery. Secondary we studied the influence of a preload compared with fluid restriction on discharge time and micturition problems.One hundred patients undergoing day-case arthroscopy were randomised to receive either lidocaine (L) 60 mg or chloroprocaine (CP) 40 mg intrathecally and this with (L+, CP+) or without (L?, CP?) a 500 ml pre-load of crystalloid. Block characteristics, micturition and discharge times were registered. Bladder volumes were monitored by ultrasound. Micturition problems received a micturition score.Onset and quality of the block were comparable between groups. Time to regain Bromage 1 and L2 regression were shorter for the CP group compared with the L group. Voiding (168 ± 44 min) and discharge (178 ± 52 min) were approximately 40 min faster for the CP group compared with the L group. Pre-load provided faster bladder filling but there were no differences in voiding time within the CP or L group. The CP+ group (166 ± 36 min) was discharged faster than both L groups (226 ± 57 min, 227 ± 59 min). More serious micturition problems occurred in the L+ group compared with both CP groups.Chloroprocaine is suitable for day-case surgery because of faster block regression and discharge than lidocaine. A 500 ml pre-load may not affect discharge but did not increase micturition problems for chloroprocaine.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563922","annotations":[{"name":"Lidocaine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidocaine"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.770497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Intrathecal","weight":0.730216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrathecal"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.689325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Urination","weight":0.683353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urination"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.220692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Chloroprocaine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroprocaine"},{"name":"Preload (cardiology)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preload_(cardiology)"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"226","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/226"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"227 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/227_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Onset, Massachusetts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onset,_Massachusetts"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Fluid restriction","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_restriction"}]}
