{"id":47178,"title":"Motility response to colonic distention is increased in postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS).","abstract":"Acute intestinal infection leads to persistent intestinal smooth muscle hypercontractility and pain hypersensitivity after resolution of the infection in animal models. We investigated whether postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is associated with abnormalities in phasic contractions of the colon, smooth muscle tone, and pain sensitivity compared to non-PI-IBS (NI-IBS) or healthy controls (HC).Two hundred and eighteen Rome III-positive IBS patients and 43 HC participated. IBS patients were designated PI-IBS, if their IBS symptoms began following an episode of gastroenteritis characterized by two or more of: fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Pain threshold to phasic distentions of the descending colon was assessed using a barostat. Colonic motility was assessed with the barostat bag minimally inflated to the individual operating pressure (IOP), at 20 mmHg above the IOP, and following a test meal. IBS symptom severity and psychological symptoms were assessed by the IBS Severity Scale (IBS-SS) and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18).Twenty two (10.1%) met criteria for PI-IBS. Both IBS and HC groups showed a significant increase in motility index during intraluminal distention and following meals. The magnitude of the response to distention above (orad to) the balloon was significantly greater in PI-IBS compared with NI-IBS (p < 0.05) or HC (p < 0.01). Differences between PI-IBS and NI-IBS were not significant for IBS symptom severity, pain threshold, barostat bag volumes, or any psychological score on the BSI-18.Patients with PI-IBS have greater colonic hypercontractility than NI-IBS. We speculate that sustained mild mucosal inflammation may cause this colonic irritability.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602083","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.794399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.767707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Irritability","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritability"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.674938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"Intestinal parasite","weight":0.66626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_parasite"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.592804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.453623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.409153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.267195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Rome","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Descending colon","weight":0.0607609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_colon"},{"name":"Balloon","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Meal","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal"},{"name":"Sensory receptor","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_receptor"},{"name":"Threshold of pain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_pain"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"}]}
