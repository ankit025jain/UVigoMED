{"id":53159,"title":"[A cross-sectional survey on prevalence and risk factors for abnormal plasma liver enzymes in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus].","abstract":"To explore the prevalence and risk factors for abnormal plasma liver enzymes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from 60 tertiary and secondary hospitals in Guangdong Province between August 2011 and March 2012. The abnormal plasma liver enzymes was diagnosed as alanine aminotransferase >40 U/L and/or aspartate aminotransferase >40 U/L. Binary Logistic regression was used to assess the associations between abnormal plasma liver enzymes and associated risk factors.The abnormal plasma liver enzymes were detected in 709/3543 diabetics with overweight or obesity. And the prevalence of abnormal plasma liver enzymes was 20.0%. According to binary Logistic regression analysis, the presence of abnormal plasma liver enzymes was associated with male gender (OR = 1.603, 95%CI: 1.247-2.061), higher HbA1c(OR = 1.049, 95%CI: 1.005-1.096), higher body mass index (OR = 1.058, 95%CI: 1.014-1.103), higher waist circumference (OR = 1.019, 95%CI: 1.006-1.032), higher triglyceride level (OR = 1.053, 95%CI: 1.008-1.100), adiposis hepatica (OR = 1.543; 95%CI: 1.244-1.914), regular exercises (OR = 0.591, 95%CI: 0.472-0.740) and diet control (OR = 0.794, 95%CI: 0.635-0.993).There is a high prevalence of abnormal plasma liver enzymes in overweight/obese with diabetics. And decreasing the levels of HbA1c, body mass index, waist circumference and triglycerides, regular exercises and diet control may decrease its prevalence.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Endocrine
