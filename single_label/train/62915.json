{"id":62915,"title":"Statin use is associated with reduced risk of haematological malignancies: evidence from a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Several observational studies have shown that statin use may modify the risk of haematological malignancies. To quantify the association between statin use and risk for haematological malignancies, we performed a detailed meta-analysis of published studies regarding this subject.We conducted a systematic search of multiple databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library Central database up to July 2013. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were used to estimate summary relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Potential sources of heterogeneity were detected by meta-regression. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis were also performed.A total of 20 eligible studies (ten case-control studies, four cohort studies, and six RCTs) reporting 1,139,584 subjects and 15,297 haematological malignancies cases were included. Meta-analysis showed that statin use was associated with a statistically significant 19% reduction in haematological malignancies incidence (RR?=?0.81, 95% CI [0.70, 0.92]). During subgroup analyses, statin use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of haematological malignancies among observational studies (RR?=?0.79, 95% CI [0.67, 0.93]), but not among RCTs (RR?=?0.92, 95% CI [0.77, 1.09]).Based on this comprehensive meta-analysis, statin use may have chemopreventive effects against haematological malignancies. More studies, especially definitive, randomized chemoprevention trials are needed to confirm this association.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498014","annotations":[{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.791577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.750183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Sensitivity analysis","weight":0.689429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.657937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.638165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.591951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.395599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.361111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.270477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0390912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Chemoprophylaxis","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoprophylaxis"}]}
