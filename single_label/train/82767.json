{"id":82767,"title":"Evaluation of a novel approach in the prevention of white spot lesions around orthodontic brackets.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the relative efficacy of a resin fissure sealant, nano-filled self-adhesive protective coating, resin infiltrant, glass ionomer cement (GIC), and GIC containing casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) in preventing the formation of subsurface lesions of enamel (SLE) adjacent to orthodontic brackets by acting as an enamel surface sealant (ESS).Eighty-five enamel specimens with molar tubes bonded at their centre were randomly divided into five groups, each treated with a different material at the bracket's periphery. Specimens were stored in an acetate demineralization solution at pH 4.5 for 7 days at 37?°C then imaged using quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) to determine the difference in fluorescence (?F) between sound- and acid-exposed enamel. Lesion cross-sections were then examined using backscattered scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to measure lesion depth.The use of GIC alone or incorporating CPP-ACP significantly reduced ?F compared with other materials. Backscattered SEM images showed no measurable demineralization for enamel treated with either GIC material in contrast with other groups, which showed statistically significant demineralization levels.The fluoride-releasing effects and CPP-ACP benefits of the GIC materials show promise as an effective ESS in inhibiting enamel demineralization adjacent to orthodontic brackets.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528001","annotations":[{"name":"Scanning electron
