{"id":47050,"title":"Recent insights into the molecular pathophysiology of lipid droplet formation in hepatocytes.","abstract":"Triacyglycerols are a major energy reserve of the body and are normally stored in adipose tissue as lipid droplets (LDs). The liver, however, stores energy as glycogen and digested triglycerides in the form of fatty acids. In stressed condition such as obesity, imbalanced nutrition and drug induced liver injury hepatocytes accumulate excess lipids in the form of LDs whose prolonged storage leads to disease conditions most notably non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Fatty liver disease has become a major health burden with more than 90% of obese, nearly 70% of overweight and about 25% of normal weight patients being affected. Notably, research in recent years has shown LD as highly dynamic organelles for maintaining lipid homeostasis through fat storage, protein sorting and other molecular events studied in adipocytes and other cells of living organisms. This review focuses on the molecular events of LD formation in hepatocytes and the importance of cross talk between different cell types and their signalling in NAFLD as to provide a perspective on molecular mechanisms as well as possibilities for different therapeutic intervention strategies.
