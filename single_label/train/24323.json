{"id":24323,"title":"Prevalence of rectal colonization with multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae among international patients hospitalized at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.","abstract":"Rectal colonization with multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae was found in 23 of 94 consecutively enrolled international patients hospitalized at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. No carbapenemase producers were detected. Twenty-one isolates were extended-spectrum ?-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. Colonization was associated with gastrointestinal disease and central venous catheter placement within the antecedent year.
