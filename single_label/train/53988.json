{"id":53988,"title":"Extensive experience in the management of macroprolactinomas.","abstract":"Macroprolactinomas are pituitary tumours that can be managed with dopamine agonists (DA), surgery and radiotherapy. We aimed to assess the outcomes of these treatment modalities.Retrospective case-note study of patients managed in a single tertiary referral centre.One hundred patients (68 male) diagnosed with macroprolactinoma between 1971 and 2009.We assessed the response to first-line treatment in terms of reduction in serum prolactin, endocrine status, symptomatic improvement and tumour shrinkage. Patients were divided into a group that received only DA therapy and a group that received surgery, radiotherapy or both, with or without a DA. We compared pituitary function at baseline and at last clinic visit between the two groups.In total, there were 1170 patient years of follow-up. Pituitary surgery was performed in 29/100 patients. Fourteen patients received pituitary radiotherapy (8/14 surgery also). At last clinic visit, the nonmedical therapy group had a higher risk of gonadotrophin deficiency (77·4% vs 44·8%, P = 0·0037), TSH deficiency (54·8% vs 25·4%, P = 0·0009) and ACTH deficiency (56·2% vs 17·2%, P = 0·0001). When last reviewed, 23/29 (79·3%) patients who underwent surgery and 10/14 (71·4%) patients who received radiotherapy were taking a DA.Treatment with a DA alone is associated with better outcomes in terms of pituitary function and as such represents the optimal first-line therapy for macroprolactinomas. Surgery and radiotherapy should be reserved for patients who are either intolerant of or resistant to DAs. Following surgery and/or radiotherapy, the majority of patients still require a DA for control of prolactin hypersecretion.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483350","annotations":[{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone","weight":0.851508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.811523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Adrenocorticotropic hormone","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dopamine agonist","weight":0.750124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_agonist"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.645987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Support group","weight":0.459309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.265507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.129641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"814","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/814"},{"name":"774","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/774"},{"name":"793","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/793"},{"name":"548","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/548"},{"name":"254","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/254"},{"name":"1014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1014"},{"name":"1170","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1170"},{"name":"448","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/448"},{"name":"Lactose intolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"District attorney","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Area code 562","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_562"}]}
