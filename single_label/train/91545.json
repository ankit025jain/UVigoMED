{"id":91545,"title":"Toxicity of quantum dots on respiratory system.","abstract":"Quantum dots (QDs), as advanced nanotechnology products, are widely used in the bio-medical field for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes due to their unique properties. Therefore, it becomes important for researchers to elucidate the adverse effects of QDs on human beings. This essay provides an overview of the toxic effects of QDs on respiratory system, which are summarized into two main parts: in vitro toxicity, including reduction of cell viability, genetic material damage and disordered immune cell reactions; as well as in vivo toxicity, involving accumulation of QDs, lung injury and inflammation, and potential long-term adverse effects. As the toxic severity of a QD type depends on its composition, dose, size, surface chemistry and structure, it is a big challenge to determine a benchmark of QDs. Thus, we have to remember that each QD type is a unique nanocrystal, which needs to be assessed individually. However, there are still some feasible recommendations for minimizing the toxicity provided in this review. Overall, more and more large-scale well-organized toxicity studies of different QD types on different species need to be conducted in order to provide guidelines of QDs' safety application.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495248","annotations":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.812086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.800352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.778062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.628296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.548236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.530616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.520478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.415013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Molecular nanotechnology","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.313525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.282582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.241683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Quantum dot","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot"},{"name":"Quantum mechanics","weight":0.133182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Nanocrystal","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanocrystal"},{"name":"Surface science","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_science"},{"name":"Essay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
