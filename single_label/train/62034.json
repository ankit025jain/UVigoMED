{"id":62034,"title":"Incorporating tyrosine kinase inhibitors into treatment regimens for AML and ALL: is there a right or wrong way?","abstract":"Although combination chemotherapy regimens have been clearly successful in treating a proportion of patients with acute leukemia, we are probably close to a ceiling of maximal benefit from such combinations. Identification of targets in the cellular signaling pathways and development of specific drugs against them have added to our armamentarium; our current challenge is how to best incorporate these agents into the currently available regimens.
