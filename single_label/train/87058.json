{"id":87058,"title":"A substitution in the transmembrane region of the glycoprotein leads to an unstable attenuation of Machupo virus.","abstract":"Machupo virus (MACV) is the etiologic agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF). Utilizing a reverse-genetics system recently developed, we report the rescue of a rationally modified recombinant MACV containing a single mutation in the transmembrane region of the glycoprotein. Following challenge of susceptible mice, we identified a significant reduction in virulence in the novel virus. We also identified an instability leading to reversion of the single mutation to a wild-type genotype.
