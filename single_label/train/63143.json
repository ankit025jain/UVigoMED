{"id":63143,"title":"Pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour after Hodgkin's lymphoma.","abstract":"Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT plays a major role in staging, assessing response to treatment and during follow-up of paediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Owing to high sensitivity to detect viable tumoural tissue, negative PET/CT is highly predictive of survival. However, (18)F-FDG is not specific for malignant disease and may concentrate in numerous benign/inflammatory lesions that may cause 'false-positive' results and follow-up PET/CT studies should be interpreted with caution. We report a case of pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, which developed during follow-up in a young patient with complete remission of a stage IIB HL and was fully treated with surgical resection.
