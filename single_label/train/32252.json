{"id":32252,"title":"Fluoxetine (SSRI) treatment of canine atopic dermatitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.","abstract":"This study investigated effects of a fluoxetine (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; SSRI, 1 mg/kg) on pruritus in canine atopic dermatitis (CAD). After 4-weeks of base-line observation, 8 dogs with CAD entered a 2-months randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial comparing fluoxetine with placebo. Clinical efficacy was evaluated using a Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI-03) and Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (PVAS). Six dogs completed the study [two out of eight dogs (both of them were Shiba Inu) dropped out from the study due to a depression]. CADESI-03 and PVAS between fluoxetine and placebo showed no significant difference statistically (P > 0.05 and P > 0.05 respectively). Fluoxetine showed no efficacy on pruritus in CAD. Further researches are needed for the treatment on pruritus of CAD.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988868","annotations":[{"name":"Fluoxetine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine"},{"name":"Itch","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.798264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.412831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.360883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Shiba Inu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu"},{"name":"Computer-aided design","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0295547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Analog Science Fiction and Fact","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Dropping out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_out"},{"name":"Severity (video game)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severity_(video_game)"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"}]}
