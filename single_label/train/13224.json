{"id":13224,"title":"PLGA-nanoparticle mediated delivery of anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody enhances anti-tumor cytotoxic T cell responses.","abstract":"OX40 (CD134) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor expressed mainly on activated T cells and transmits a potent costimulatory signal once engaged. Agonistic anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) enhances tumor immune response leading to therapeutic effects in mouse tumor models. However, when tested in phase I clinical trials it did not show objective clinical activity in cancer patients. In this study, we examined the feasibility of nanoparticle (NP)-mediated delivery of anti-OX40 mAb to efficiently induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. The biodegradable poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticle (PLGA-NP) carrying anti-OX40 mAb, anti-OX40-PLGA-NP, was prepared by double emulsion method and showed an average diameter of 86 nm with a loading efficiency of 25%. We found that anti-OX40-PLGA-NP induced CTL proliferation and tumor antigen-specific cytotoxicity as well as cytokine production more strongly than free anti-OX40 mAb. These results suggest that PLGA-based nanoparticle formulation may provide efficient delivery system of anti-OX40 mAb for cancer immunotherapy.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487032","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.892448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.863041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cancer immunotherapy","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_immunotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.728216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.70429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.220329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"CD134","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD134"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Biodegradation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
