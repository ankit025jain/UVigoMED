{"id":18365,"title":"Pulse pressure variations to guide fluid therapy in donors: a multicentric echocardiographic observational study.","abstract":"Preload responsiveness parameters could be useful in the hemodynamic management of septic shock.A multicentric prospective echocardiographic observational study was conducted from March 2009 to August 2011. Clinically brain-dead subjects were included. Pulse pressure variations (?PPs) were recorded. Cardiac index, variation of the maximum flow velocity of aortic systolic blood flow, and right ventricular function parameters were evaluated via transthoracic echocardiography. Fluid responsiveness was defined by at least 15% cardiac index increase, 30 minutes after a 500-mL colloid solution infusion. The number of organs harvested was recorded.Twenty-five subjects were included. Pulse pressure variation could not discriminate responders (n=15) from nonresponders (n=10). The best ?PP threshold (20%) could discriminate responders with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 40%. Variation of the maximum flow velocity of aortic systolic blood flow, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, and right ventricle dilation could not discriminate responders from nonresponders. Eighteen subjects underwent organ harvesting. The number of organs harvested was higher in responders (3.5 [3-5]) than in nonresponders (2.5 [2-3]; P=.03).A ?PP threshold of 13% is insufficient to guide volume expansion in donors. The best threshold is 20%. Fluid responsiveness monitoring could enhance organ harvesting.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798343","annotations":[{"name":"Pulse pressure","weight":0.847427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_pressure"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.77938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Tricuspid valve","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_valve"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.67583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.620865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Preload (cardiology)","weight":0.601579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preload_(cardiology)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.504676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.470113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Colloid","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid"},{"name":"Septic shock","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.351701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.30913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.270315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.20264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Fluid replacement","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Brain death","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Cardiac index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_index"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"}]}
