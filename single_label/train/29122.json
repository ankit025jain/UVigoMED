{"id":29122,"title":"Predictors of drinking and functional outcomes for men and women following inpatient alcohol treatment.","abstract":"This prospective study uses path analytic models to examine baseline characteristics associated with both functioning and drinking outcomes 12 months after inpatient alcohol treatment.Alcohol-dependent participants (N?=?101) were recruited during inpatient alcohol treatment and assessed monthly 1 year after discharge.Alcohol severity was negatively associated with education and self-efficacy; marital status was positively associated with self-efficacy; and education and self-efficacy were negatively associated with drinking outcomes. Low alcohol severity, not having a depression diagnosis, and being married were associated with less social support impairment, which was in turn associated with better drinking outcomes. Having a history of sexual abuse did not influence drinking outcomes. However, having a history of sexual abuse was negatively associated with global functioning.Drinking outcomes were associated with education, self-efficacy, social support, and diagnosis of depression at baseline; however, global functioning 1 year following treatment was primarily and negatively associated with sexual abuse history. Future treatment research should include measures of both functioning and drinking behavior outcomes.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724879","annotations":[{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.809257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Sexual abuse","weight":0.781812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.656281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.630041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.46484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.369579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.297256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.262149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"History","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Social support","weight":0.147269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_support"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.146844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Marriage","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Marital status","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_status"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"}]}
