{"id":90005,"title":"Tip of the iceberg: subtle findings on traumatic knee radiographs portend significant injury.","abstract":"Despite their low clinical yield, knee radiographs are among the most commonly acquired radiographic trauma studies in the emergency department. Although obvious fractures may be present, several subtler radiographic findings suggest internal derangement and significant injury. In this review, we provide an overview of traumatic knee radiography, including anatomy, acquisition techniques, and pitfalls with associated magnetic resonance imaging correlation when available.
