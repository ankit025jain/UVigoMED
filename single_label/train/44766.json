{"id":44766,"title":"hnRNP L and NF90 interact with hepatitis C virus 5'-terminal untranslated RNA and promote efficient replication.","abstract":"The 5'-terminal sequence of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive-strand RNA genome is essential for viral replication. Critical host factors, including a miR-122/Ago2 complex and poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), associate with this RNA segment. We used a biotinylated RNA pulldown approach to isolate host factors binding to the HCV 5' terminal 47 nucleotides and, in addition to Ago2 and PCBP2, identified several novel proteins, including IGF2BP1, hnRNP L, DHX9, ADAR1, and NF90 (ILF3). PCBP2, IGF2BP1, and hnRNP L bound single-stranded RNA, while DHX9, ADAR1, and NF90 bound a cognate double-stranded RNA bait. PCBP2, IGF2BP1, and hnRNP L binding were blocked by preannealing the single-stranded RNA bait with miR-122, indicating that they bind the RNA in competition with miR-122. However, IGF2BP1 binding was also inhibited by high concentrations of heparin, suggesting that it bound the bait nonspecifically. Among these proteins, small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of hnRNP L and NF90 significantly impaired viral replication and reduced infectious virus yields without substantially affecting HCV internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. hnRNP L and NF90 were found to associate with HCV RNA in infected cells and to coimmunoprecipitate with NS5A in an RNA-dependent manner. Both also associate with detergent-resistant membranes where viral replication complexes reside. We conclude that hnRNP and NF90 are important host factors for HCV replication, at least in cultured cells, and may be present in the replication complex.Although HCV replication has been intensively studied in many laboratories, many aspects of the viral life cycle remain obscure. Here, we use a novel RNA pulldown strategy coupled with mass spectrometry to identify host cell proteins that interact functionally with regulatory RNA elements located at the extreme 5' end of the positive-strand RNA genome. We identify two, primarily nuclear RNA-binding proteins, hnRNP L and NF90, with previously unrecognized proviral roles in HCV replication. The data presented add to current understanding of the replication cycle of this pathogenic human virus.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Digestive System
