{"id":72057,"title":"Overexpressed ubiquitin ligase Cullin7 in breast cancer promotes cell proliferation and invasion via down-regulating p53.","abstract":"Ubiquitin ligase Cullin7 has been identified as an oncogene in some malignant diseases such as choriocarcinoma and neuroblastoma. However, the role of Cullin7 in breast cancer carcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we compared Cullin7 protein levels in breast cancer tissues with normal breast tissues and identified significantly higher expression of Cullin7 protein in breast cancer specimens. By overexpressing Cullin7 in breast cancer cells HCC1937, we found that Cullin7 could promote cell growth and invasion in vitro. In contrast, the cell growth and invasion was inhibited by silencing Cullin7 in breast cancer cell BT474. Moreover, we demonstrated that Cullin7 promoted breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion via down-regulating p53 expression. Thus, our study provided evidence that Cullin7 functions as a novel oncogene in breast cancer and may be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer management.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25003318","annotations":[{"name":"Neuroblastoma","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma"},{"name":"Choriocarcinoma","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choriocarcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.844756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.843613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ubiquitin","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.770479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.748124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.717012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Ubiquitin ligase","weight":0.650484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.500029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.481023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Ligase","weight":0.412851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligase"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.399831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.17769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"CUL7","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUL7"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
