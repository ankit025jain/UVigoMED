{"id":36923,"title":"Novel single base-pair deletion in exon 1 of XK gene leading to McLeod syndrome with chorea, muscle wasting, peripheral neuropathy, acanthocytosis and haemolysis.","abstract":"We present a 70-year-old male patient of Greek origin with choreatic movements of the tongue and face, lower limb muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, elevated creatinephosphokinase (CPK), acanthocytosis and haemolysis in the absence of Kell RBC antigens with an additional Factor IX-deficiency. Genetic testing for mutations in the three exons of the XK gene revealed a previously unreported hemizygous single base-pair frameshift deletion at exon 1 (c.229delC, p.Leu80fs). In conclusion, we hereby describe a rare phenotype of a patient with McLeod syndrome which was discovered coincidentally during routine blood group testing and consecutively genetically confirmed.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529944","annotations":[{"name":"Exon","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon"},{"name":"Choreia (disease)","weight":0.873318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choreia_(disease)"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.847604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Zygosity","weight":0.806247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetic testing","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.754445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Muscle atrophy","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_atrophy"},{"name":"Muscle weakness","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness"},{"name":"Creatine kinase","weight":0.645714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine_kinase"},{"name":"Leucine","weight":0.638494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.601573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Greek language","weight":0.464176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.358563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.3316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"McLeod syndrome","weight":0.226923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod_syndrome"},{"name":"Translational frameshift","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_frameshift"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.174669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"Acanthocyte","weight":0.123432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthocyte"},{"name":"XK (protein)","weight":0.110635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XK_(protein)"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Wasting","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasting"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Kell antigen system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kell_antigen_system"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"}]}
