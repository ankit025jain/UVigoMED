{"id":54833,"title":"Postoperative changes in amniotic membrane as a carrier for allogeneic cultured limbal epithelial transplantation.","abstract":"To investigate the morphologic changes and outcomes of the amniotic membrane as a carrier for allogeneic cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation.Prospective, noncomparative, interventional study.A total of 16 eyes receiving allogeneic cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation with amniotic membrane as a carrier were enrolled. Morphologic changes in the amniotic membrane were observed by confocal microscopy and RTVue optical coherence tomography. The paired t test was employed to compare the mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and corneal stromal thickness.Of the 16 eyes, 12 had stable ocular surfaces (group A), while the other 4 eyes had failed surgeries due to immune rejection (group B). Confocal microscopy showed residual amniotic membrane tissues in 8 eyes in group A at 1 year. However, the amniotic membrane was not detected in group B at 8-10 months. RTVue optical coherence tomography showed discontinuous amniotic membrane tissues in all eyes in group A at 1 year, while highly reflective opacity was seen in the corneal stroma in group B. There were no statistically significant differences in mean BCVA and corneal stromal thickness in group A at 1 month and 1 year after transplantation (P > 0.05), but the mean BCVA showed a statistically significant difference at 1 month and after the disappearance of the amniotic membrane in group B (P < 0.05).For eyes with stable ocular surfaces after cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation, the amniotic membrane can be present in the cornea for at least 1 year, with no impact on visual acuity or corneal stromal thickness. Chronic inflammation and neovascularization on the ocular surface may accelerate the disappearance of the amniotic membrane.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135224","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.838126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.815861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.612649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Stroma of cornea","weight":0.466646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_of_cornea"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.357115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.331956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.244818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.222769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.213174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0671824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Opacity (optics)","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)"},{"name":"Stroma (animal tissue)","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_(animal_tissue)"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Reflection (physics)","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Amnion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnion"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"}]}
