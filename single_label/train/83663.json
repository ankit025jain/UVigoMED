{"id":83663,"title":"Perigastric appendagitis: CT and clinical features  in eight patients.","abstract":"To describe perigastric appendagitis (PA) on CT as a new and distinct clinical entity to enable recognition and prevent additional unnecessary investigation or intervention.Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was waived. Retrospective review of the clinical data and CT findings in eight patients with PA encountered over 10 years at one institution was performed. The English literature was reviewed and summarized. Two experienced abdominal radiologists reviewed the CT images by consensus.Seven of eight patients had moderate to severe epigastric pain for 1–7 days. All eight patients (four men, four women; mean age 44 years, range 33–81 years) had no fever or leukocytosis. All underwent abdominal CT which showed ovoid fat inflammation along the course of the perigastric ligaments (gastrohepatic, gastrosplenic, and falciform). Two had gastric wall thickening. Although the inflammation was correctly described, the specific diagnosis was not made on initial interpretation in five patients. Subsequently, they underwent further diagnostic testing [an upper gastrointestinal examination and hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) cholescintigraphy, an upper endoscopy and MRI examination, HIDA cholescintigraphy, another CT, and an MRI examination, respectively]. The HIDA cholescintigraphy, upper GI examination, and upper endoscopy examinations were normal. No repeated examination was performed on the other three patients. Pain resolved spontaneously in all within two days.Perigastric appendagitis can present with an acute abdomen, which is safely managed conservatively if diagnosed correctly. Radiologists should be aware of the entity to avoid unnecessary intervention, and recognize the CT findings of ovoid fat inflammation in the distribution of the perigastric ligaments.","date":"2015-01-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278036","annotations":[{"name":"Acute abdomen","weight":0.847842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_abdomen"},{"name":"Leukocytosis","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.821863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Esophagogastroduodenoscopy","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagogastroduodenoscopy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.754497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Epigastrium","weight":0.562785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigastrium"},{"name":"Institutional review board","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.307409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.284101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.155517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0392565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Consent","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Oval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval"},{"name":"Hepatobiliary system","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatobiliary_system"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Thickening agent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening_agent"}]}
