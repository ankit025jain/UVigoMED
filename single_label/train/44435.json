{"id":44435,"title":"Reliability of MDCT, with MPR and hydro-CT technique, in resectability and lymphnode staging of gastric cancer.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of thin-slice hydro-multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) in assessing resectability and lymph node staging of gastric cancer.Sixty-one patients (37 males, 24 females; mean age 61 years) with gastric cancer, and whose surgery was planned, underwent preoperative abdominopelvic hydro-MDCT at slice thickness of 5 mm. We evaluated the tumor stage, depth of tumor invasion into the gastric wall, metastasis of lymph node, and presence/absence of distant metastases on the CT images produced with multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) and hydro-CT technique. The results were compared with pathological and surgical findings. Diagnostic accuracy was also analyzed.Of 61 patients with gastric cancer, 6 (14%) were inoperable, 45 (68%) were advanced stage, and 10 (16%) were early stage gastric cancer patients. The detection rate of the primary tumor was 97% for MDCT; the overall accuracy of MDCT in the determination of the depth of invasion and serosal involvement when compared with pathological staging were 84% and 95%, respectively; the overall accuracy rate in lymph node staging was 73.5%.MDCT can improve the accuracy of preoperative T and N staging of gastric cancer and will contribute to treatment strategies for patients with advanced stage gastric cancer.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736448","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.802204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.703461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.558072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Serous membrane","weight":0.0695946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_membrane"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"}]}
