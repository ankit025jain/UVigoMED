{"id":21671,"title":"Regional advisory board position statement on optimal pneumococcal vaccination in adults. Update to 2011 consensus on adult pneumococcal disease: update on optimal pneumococcal vaccination in adults.","abstract":"An important development in the field of adult pneumococcal vaccination since the last Consensus Statement, published by the Expert Panel of Central and Eastern Europe and Israel (the Region) in September 2012, was the licensure of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for adults aged 50 years and older.The Expert Panel has developed this Position Statement as an update to its previous Consensus to address the following topics which are likely to be on the agenda of national scientific societies during the ongoing updates of vaccination recommendations in the Region: the availability of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults over 50 years of age, the available clinical evidence on its use in adults, and the future place of conjugate vaccines in adult pneumococcal vaccination. The Expert Panel concluded that there is sufficient epidemiologic immunogenicity and safety evidence to use PCV 13 in adults over 50 years of age.The use of conjugate vaccine induces immunological memory and can overcome some limitations associated with the plain polysaccharide vaccine (PPV). It was also agreed that, if the use of PPV is considered appropriate, PCV13 should be administered first, regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination status.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592732","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunogenicity","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunogenicity"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.519526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.392217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.372947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.196465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Licensure","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensure"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Conjugate vaccine","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Central Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Learned society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_society"}]}
