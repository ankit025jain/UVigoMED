{"id":68966,"title":"Darbepoetin alfa once every 2 weeks effectively maintained hemoglobin in dialysis patients in an observational study: Austrian cohort of ALTERNATE.","abstract":"ALTERNATE is an international observational study evaluating biweekly darbepoetin alfa (DA) in adult dialysis patients in clinical practice. Austrian ALTERNATE results are presented here (n?=?505). The follow-up study ALTERNATE follow-up (AFU) followed Austrian ALTERNATE patients for an additional 12 months (n?=?135). Data were collected 6 months before and 12 months after conversion to biweekly dosing and during 12 months of follow-up. The primary measures were hemoglobin concentration 12 months after conversion and at the end of AFU, respectively. Mean (95?% CI) hemoglobin (g/dL) was 11.87 (11.75-11.99) at conversion, 11.71 (11.58-11.83) at month 12, and 11.66 (11.45-11.86) at end of AFU. Geometric mean (95?% CI) weekly dose (?g/wk) was 32.97 (30.80-35.30) at conversion, 29.90 (26.71-33.46) 12 months after conversion, and 24.38 (18.40-30.35) at end of AFU. The studies show that hemoglobin and dose could be effectively maintained over an extended period of time after conversion from higher frequency erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to biweekly DA.","date":"2014-03-27","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482075","annotations":[{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.129769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Geometric mean","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean"},{"name":"Darbepoetin alfa","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbepoetin_alfa"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Intel MCS-48","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-48"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Biweekly","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biweekly"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
