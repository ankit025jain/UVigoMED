{"id":61063,"title":"The influence of axillary reverse mapping related factors on lymphedema in breast cancer patients.","abstract":"Upper extremity lymphedema (LE) is a harmful breast cancer complication. It has been reported that patient- or treatment-related risk factors of LE. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) has been performed to prevent LE during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) by visualizing the upper extremity lymphatics. We investigated whether ARM related factors included novel predictive risk factors of LE.ARM revealed fluorescent axillary nodes (ARM nodes) in 76 patients by fluorescence imaging. Only ARM nodes within the ALND field were removed. Twenty-four (32%) patients developed LE (LE+) and 52 did not (LE-) during a median 24-month post-surgical follow-up period. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical features and ARM factors of LE+ and LE-.The positive ARM node rate among LE+ was 42%, significantly greater frequency than that among LE- (13%: p ? 0.05). Cranial collectors (lymphatic ducts along or above the axillary vein) were significantly more frequent in LE- (44%) than in LE+ (21%: p ? 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed postoperative radiation and positive ARM nodes to be positive risk factors and cranial collectors to be a negative risk factor of LE.ARM factors could predict the incidence of LE post-axillary surgeries in breast cancer patients.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768416","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.900742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.843236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.779278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Axillary lymph nodes","weight":0.677229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.563785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.56214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.319711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.174982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.126224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"ARM architecture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture"},{"name":"Axillary vein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_vein"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Field (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Axillary nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_nerve"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Common bile duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bile_duct"},{"name":"Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_correlation_spectroscopy"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
