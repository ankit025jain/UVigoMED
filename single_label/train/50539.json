{"id":50539,"title":"High levels of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) expression were associated with aggressive clinical features in ovarian cancer.","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between WT1 expression levels and clinical features, to investigate the prognostic value of WT1 expression and to use lentiviral constructs to examine whether overexpression of WT1 affects cell proliferation and invasion in ovarian cancer patients.Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were employed to analyze WT1 expression levels in clinical samples from 63 patients with ovarian cancer. The correlation between the copy number of WT1 mRNA and clinical variables was analyzed.The median copy number of WT1 mRNA was 53.94 (range=2.135-32,257) in all subjects and WT1 expression levels were found significantly increased in patients with a higher stage cancer (p<0.05), lymphnode (p<0.001) and omentum metastasis (p<0.001), as well as ascites production (p<0.05), compared to patients lacking these clinical variables. No significant difference in WT1 expression levels were observed between patients with and without recurrence. The median disease-free survival time in patients with low WT1 expression levels was significantly longer (p=0.038) than that in patients with high WT1 expression. However, overall survival curves showed no statistically significant (p=0.457) differences between patients with high- and low-WT1 expression levels. An in vitro study revealed that WT1 over-expression enhanced cell proliferation and invasion in ovarian cancer cells transduced with lentiviral constructs.Using qPCR, we found that high levels of WT1 expression correlated with aggressive clinical features in ovarian cancer. High WT1 expression may impact on median disease-free survival in ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778040","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.827199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.782449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Wilms' tumor","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilms'_tumor"},{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.610066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.558966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.496499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.412002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Lentivirus","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentivirus"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.294864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.256577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"WT1","weight":0.208017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WT1"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Greater omentum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Sampling bias","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Expression vector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_vector"}]}
