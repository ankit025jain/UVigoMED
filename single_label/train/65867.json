{"id":65867,"title":"Assessment of progression-free survival as a surrogate end-point for overall survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"To determine suitability of progression-free survival (PFS) as a surrogate end-point for overall survival (OS), we evaluated the relationship between PFS and OS in 750 treatment-na√Øve metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients who received sunitinib or interferon-alpha (IFN-?) in a phase III study.The relationship between PFS and post-progression survival (PPS; the difference between PFS and OS) was studied, which correctly removes inherent dependencies between PFS and OS, to properly estimate whether and to what extent PFS can serve as a surrogate for OS. A Weibull parametric model to failure time data was fit to determine whether longer PFS was significantly and meaningfully predictive of longer PPS. In a sensitivity analysis by Kaplan-Meier non-parametric method, PPS curves for three approximately equal numbered groups of patients categorised by PFS were compared by log-rank test.In the Weibull parametric model, longer PFS was significantly predictive of longer PPS (P<0.001). The model also allowed prediction of estimated median PPS duration from actual PFS times. In the Kaplan-Meier (non-parametric) analysis, incrementally longer PFS was also associated with longer PPS, and the PPS curves for the three PFS groups were significantly different (P<0.0001).A positive relationship was found between PFS and PPS duration in individual mRCC patients randomised to first-line treatment with sunitinib or IFN-?. These results indicate that PFS can act as a surrogate end-point for OS in the first-line mRCC setting and provide clinical researchers with a potentially useful approach to estimate median PPS based on PFS.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768571","annotations":[{"name":"Non-parametric statistics","weight":0.902825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Parametric model","weight":0.769027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_model"},{"name":"Sensitivity analysis","weight":0.716144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis"},{"name":"Weibull distribution","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.683224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.56164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Parametric statistics","weight":0.54244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_statistics"},{"name":"Sunitinib","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunitinib"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Direct relationship","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_relationship"},{"name":"Predictive inference","weight":0.0743586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Surrogate endpoint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_endpoint"},{"name":"Logrank test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrank_test"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"}]}
