{"id":72385,"title":"Factors associated with recruiting adult survivors of childhood cancer into clinic-based research.","abstract":"A high proportion of pediatric cancer patients are now surviving into adulthood, but are at increased risk for late morbidity and premature mortality related to their diagnosis and therapeutic exposures. Little is known about the potential success of recruiting adult survivors of childhood cancer into research projects that would require a risk-based health evaluation within a clinical setting.Pediatric cancer survivors and siblings eligible for the current study were Childhood Cancer Survivor Study participants who lived within 100 miles of one of five Consortium for Pediatric Intervention Research institutions, regardless of where they were initially diagnosed and treated. A short survey was mailed to 829 survivors and 373 siblings to identify factors that predict interest, potential barriers, and motivators, to participation in research including a risk-based clinical evaluation.Overall, 92% of survivors responding to the survey were very interested/interested in participating in a research study requiring a visit to a local hospital clinic. Siblings of survivors were less interested than survivors in participating in such a study, with only 78% indicating that they were very interested/interested. Potential motivators to participation included visiting their treating hospital and receiving health information. The primary barrier to participation was related to taking time off from work.This study demonstrates that a subgroup of survivors would be willing to return to a long-term follow-up center to participate in intervention-based research. Identified motivating factors and perceived barriers need to be considered in determining the feasibility, design and execution of future research.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24976622","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.644842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.529226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.435884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.387896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.286341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.259539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.225773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"Sibling","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Survivor (TV series)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(TV_series)"},{"name":"829","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/829"},{"name":"Exposure assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_assessment"},{"name":"Identified","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identified"},{"name":"Potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Consortium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Recruitment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
