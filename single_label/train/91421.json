{"id":91421,"title":"Turning reactive glia into functional neurons in the brain.","abstract":"Following brain injury, reactive glial cells can create scars that inhibit neural repair responses. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Guo et al. report that overexpression of NeuroD1 in vivo can directly reprogram reactive glial cells into glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that integrate into the host's neural circuitry.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506877","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Neuroglia","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroglia"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Gamma-Aminobutyric acid","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Neural network","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.628037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.552243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.480921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"NEUROD1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEUROD1"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Electronic circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"}]}
