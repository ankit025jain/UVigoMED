{"id":83548,"title":"Genetic analysis of artificial Triticinae amphidiploid Aurotica based on the glaucousness trait.","abstract":"Changes in plant genomes of hybrid origin which become apparent on different levels of phenotypic manifestation of genetic and epigenetic changes are an important object of cytogenetics and molecular genetics. The changes in expression of the glaucousness trait in the artificial Triticinae amphidiploid Aurotica (AABBTT) were investigated; haplotypes of plants with the appearance of glaucous and non-glaucous genes were determined by hybridization experiments. It was supported that the changes in expression can be explained by (epi)mutations abolishing the efficiency of dominant alleles of orthologous series of glaucous inhibitor gene Iw. Analysis of F2 population with SSR markers specific to 2B and 2D wheat chromosomes and 2T chromosome of Aegilops mutica manifested associated inheritance of the Wms 102 and Wms 702 loci, which mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2D. The Wms702 marker was linked to the Iw2(T) gene and can now be used to detect that gene.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25318176","annotations":[{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.858095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Molecular genetics","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.787884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Wheat","weight":0.722756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Chromosome 2 (human)","weight":0.680937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_2_(human)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.658103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"F1 hybrid","weight":0.574945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_hybrid"},{"name":"Experiments on Plant Hybridization","weight":0.538817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiments_on_Plant_Hybridization"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.464349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.44266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Genetic analysis","weight":0.414562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_analysis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.244836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.238395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.123849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.111585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Inheritance","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"}]}
