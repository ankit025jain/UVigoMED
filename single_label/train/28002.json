{"id":28002,"title":"Do incest, depression, parental drinking, serious romantic relationships, and living with parents influence patterns of substance use during emerging adulthood?","abstract":"This study examined how incest, depression, parental drinking, relationship status, and living with parents affect patterns of substance use among emerging adults, 18 to 25 years old. The study sample included (n = 11,546) individuals who participated in Waves I, II, and III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The study used separate latent class analysis for males and females to determine how patterns of substance use clustered together. The study identified the following three classes of substance use: heavy, moderate, and normative substance use patterns. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that, for females only, incest histories also nearly doubled the risk of heavy-use class membership. In addition, experiencing depression, being single, and not living with parents serve as risk factors for males and females in the heavy-use group. Conversely, being Black, Hispanic, or living with parents lowered the likelihood of being in the group with the most substance use behaviors (i.e., heavy use). Findings highlight the need for interventions that target depression and female survivors of incest among emerging adults.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052877","annotations":[{"name":"Incest","weight":0.560345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.343788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.293613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.283484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.27036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.26504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Hispanic","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.0568479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Intimate relationship","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_relationship"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Multinomial logit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logit"},{"name":"Emerging adulthood","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_adulthood"},{"name":"National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Longitudinal_Study_of_Adolescent_Health"},{"name":"Latent class model","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_class_model"},{"name":"Romance (love)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)"},{"name":"Marital status","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_status"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Latency stage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_stage"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Computer cluster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster"},{"name":"Black people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Class struggle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Class (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Women-only passenger car","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women-only_passenger_car"},{"name":"Youth health","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_health"},{"name":"Minuscule 546","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_546"}]}
