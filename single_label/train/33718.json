{"id":33718,"title":"[Recent progress and prospects for research on urate efflux transporter ABCG2].","abstract":"ABCG2 is a high-capacity urate exporter. Two frequent variants, Q126X and Q141K are a nonfunctional and half-functional variant, respectively. The estimated ABCG2 dysfunction based on the combination of Q126X and Q141K haplotype raises gout/hyperuricemia risk. ABCG2 dysfunction accounts for about 80% of gouty patients. Severe ABCG2 dysfunction particularly increased the risk of early-onset gout. Hyperuricemia has been clinically classified into urate 'overproduction type' and/or 'underexcretion type' based solely on renal urate excretion, without considering an extra-renal pathway. A major cause of'overproduction' hyperuricemia is not true overproduction of urate but rather'extra-renal urate underexcretion' by common ABCG2 dysfunction. As ABCG2 dysfunction is a main cause of gout, ABCG2 research will provide a new approach for prevention and treatment of gout.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796111","annotations":[{"name":"Uric acid","weight":0.76664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.30503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gout","weight":0.220022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.199442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Hyperuricemia","weight":0.176208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperuricemia"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"ABCG2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCG2"},{"name":"Export","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Overproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overproduction"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"A major","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_major"}]}
