{"id":84788,"title":"[Current conceptions about astrocyte reactivity in schizophrenia].","abstract":"Literature data of the last two decades are summarized. Based on the classic conceptions about structure and functions of astrocytes, the authors review further development of research concerning the role of astroglia in schizophrenia in the following aspects: astrocyte reactivity, ultrastructural astrocyte pathology, markers of gliosis and astrocyte activation in schizophrenia, effect of neuroleptics on astrocytes. In conclusion, the authors emphasize that current studies confirm the absence of astrogliosis in the brain of schizophrenic patients. At the same time, there is evidence of the active involvement of these cells in the pathological process. It is suggested that the astrocyte activation is associated with immune changes in schizophrenia.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035887","annotations":[{"name":"Astrocyte","weight":0.930959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.78812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.508502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.37219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Gliosis","weight":0.196135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliosis"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.157879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Astrogliosis","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrogliosis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Ultrastructure","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrastructure"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
