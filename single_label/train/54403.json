{"id":54403,"title":"Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy: a case report and mini review of the literature.","abstract":"Adrenal diseases in pregnant women are diagnosed relatively rarely. The main cause of hypercortisolemia during pregnancy is Cushing's syndrome related to adrenal adenoma. It is important to diagnose Cushing's syndrome in pregnant women because it can lead to significant maternal and foetal complications and morbidity. However, due to physiological endocrine changes and symptoms in pregnant women the diagnosis of this disorder can be a challenge. One current case describes a 38-year-old pregnant woman with hypertension, oedema and an adrenal tumour. At the beginning, Conn syndrome was suspected, but after careful analysis Cushing's syndrome (with an adenoma of the right adrenal gland) was diagnosed. After delivery and 5 weeks of pharmacological treatment the patient underwent right side adrenalectomy by laparoscopy.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460501","annotations":[{"name":"Cushing's syndrome","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing's_syndrome"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Primary aldosteronism","weight":0.131191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_aldosteronism"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Adrenalectomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenalectomy"},{"name":"Adrenal adenoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_adenoma"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Mother","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother"}]}
