{"id":79797,"title":"Herbal formulations as feed additives in the course of rabbit subclinical coccidiosis.","abstract":"Two simultaneous experiments were carried out in a breeding farm of New Zealand White rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus f. domesticus) to determine the feasibility of replacing coccidiostats with garlic and oregano preparation. The research took place during June and July, the period of the greatest threat of coccidiosis caused by Eimeria spp. (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae). In one investigation, 40 rabbits aged 1-3 months were divided into four groups of ten animals: Group A being a control which received no coccidiostats in feed, Group B receiving the coccidiostat Baycox in water once at weaning, Group C receiving the coccidiostat robenidine in feed, and group D receiving herbal extracts in feed. In the second trial, six mated females were allocated equally to three groups analogous to A, C, and D above during pregnancy and lactation. Bulk stool samples were collected from each group of rabbits at weekly intervals for coproscopic analysis, and the production results of the animals were recorded. In the young rabbits, both the faecal coccidia oocyst counts and body weight gains were more favourable in group D than the remaining groups. Also, the female rabbits of group D were the least infected. The results demonstrate that garlic and oregano feed additives exert a positive influence on the level and course of coccidia infection, with regard to maintaining a good level of animal productivity, and these herbal extracts appear to have potential value in coccidiosis prophylaxy.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930248","annotations":[{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Lactation","weight":0.833599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation"},{"name":"Coccidia","weight":0.807234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidia"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"European Rabbit","weight":0.711085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Rabbit"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.695533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Apicomplexa","weight":0.676455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.634747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.467703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.395643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Garlic","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.213827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Mating","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0509955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Horse breeding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_breeding"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Oregano","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregano"},{"name":"Analogy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy"},{"name":"Eimeria","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eimeria"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"}]}
