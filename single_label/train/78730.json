{"id":78730,"title":"[Effects of stable ANO1 overexpression on biological behaviors of human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma Hep-2 cells in vitro].","abstract":"To detect the effects of ANO1 overexpression on the biological behaviors of human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma Hep-2 cells.A Hep-2 cell line stably overexpressing ANO1 were examined with flow cytometry, soft agar assay, wound healing assay, siRNA experiments, and chloride channel block with DIDS to observe the effect of ANO1 overexpression on the growth, migration and invasion of the cells.Flow cytometry revealed a comparable cell percentage in G0/G1 phase between ANO1-overexpressing cells and the control cells (P>0.05). The two cells showed no significant difference in soft agar assay (P>0.05), but in wound healing experiments, ANO1-overexpressing cells showed significantly accelerated migration (P<0.05), whereas siRNA-mediated silencing of ANO1 significantly inhibited the cell migration (P<0.05). Treatment with DIDS resulted in an effective block of the ANO1 chloride channel activity and obviously decreased the migration speed of Hep-2 cells.ANO1 overexpression does not significantly affect the proliferation of cancer cells, but can enhance the migration ability of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting the value of ANO1 as a new gene therapy target for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589607","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.928136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.661886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Agar","weight":0.632436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.580671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.528037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.515277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.496147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.383483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.299542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.25196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.17827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.154334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Chloride channel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride_channel"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Amphetamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"}]}
