{"id":22935,"title":"A study on genetic variability of pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila strains and the varied responses of the strains towards phyto-extracts.","abstract":"The present study evaluated genetic variation in Aeromonas hydrophila strains using PCR-RAPD and their varied susceptibility to phyto-extract. Four strains of Aeromonas hydrophila isolated from skin infections of common freshwater fish, Cyprinus carpio were characterized by various biochemical methods, physiological tests and PCR- RAPD. Antimicrobial activity of the leaf extracts of three medicinal plants, Ocimum sanctum, Adathoda vasica and Calendula officinalis were tested against the four strains of A. hydrophila by disc diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) method. Antagonistic effects of leaf extracts against A. hydrophila strains were assessed by co-culture method. RAPD analysis showed that all the microbes isolated from skin infection belong to the same species but there was no 100% genetic similarity among them Dendrogram constructed by UPGMA clearly supported the PCR pattern of genetic variability among the strains. This study revealed that Aeromonas hydophila exhibits genetic variability and varied susceptibility towards phyto-extracts. Results indicated that phyto-extracts offers a promising alternative to the use of antibiotics in controlling Aeromonas hydrophila.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511738","annotations":[{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.746831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.631971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Fresh water","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.204334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic variability","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variability"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Common carp","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carp"},{"name":"Calendula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendula"},{"name":"RAPD","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAPD"},{"name":"Aeromonas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromonas"},{"name":"Aeromonas hydrophila","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromonas_hydrophila"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Genetic distance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_distance"},{"name":"Freshwater fish","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_fish"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"}]}
