{"id":50589,"title":"Proinflammatory and prothrombotic state in subjects with different glucose tolerance status before cardiovascular disease.","abstract":"Inflammation has been associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and atherothrombosis.To determine differences in levels of proinflammatory and prothrombotic markers such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), prediabetes, and T2DM and to establish their relationship with other cardiovascular risk factors before clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease.We conducted a nonrandomized, cross-sectional assay in a hospital at México City. The levels of hs-CRP and fibrinogen were measured and compared according to glucose tolerance status.We enrolled 1047 individuals and they were distributed into NGT n = 473, pre-DM n = 250, and T2DM n = 216. There was a statistical difference between NGT and T2DM groups for fibrinogen (P = 0.01) and hs-CRP (P = 0.05). Fibrinogen and hs-CRP showed a significant positive correlation coefficient (r = 0.53, P<0.0001). In a multiple stepwise regression analysis, the variability in fibrinogen levels was explained by age, HbA1c, and hs-CRP (adjusted R² = 0.31, P<0.0001), and for hs-CRP it was explained by BMI and fibrinogen (adjusted R² = 0.33, P<0.0001).Inflammation and prothrombotic state are present in people with T2DM lacking cardiovascular disease. Fibrinogen and Hs-CRP are positively correlated. Fibrinogen and hs-CRP concentrations are predominantly determined by BMI rather than glucose levels.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772446","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.876726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.863687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.854484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.743951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.592804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.5184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.404062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.387222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.292821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.264178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.153996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
