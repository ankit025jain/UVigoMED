{"id":54368,"title":"The combined effect of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus on aortic stiffness and endothelial dysfunction: an integrated study with high-resolution MRI.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the combined effect of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) on aortic stiffness and endothelial dysfunction by using an integrated MRI approach.A total of 31 non-hypertensive DM2 patients and 31 hypertensive DM2 patients underwent 3.0-T MRI. Aortic distensibility (AD), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were assessed. Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test, Pearson correlation analysis, and univariable and multiple linear regression analyses were used for statistical analyses.The hypertensive patients showed lower AD at multiple levels (ascending aorta [AA]: 2.07±0.98×10(-3)mm Hg(-1) vs. 3.21±1.70×10(-3)mm Hg(-1), p<0.01; proximal thoracic descending aorta [PDA]: 2.58±0.72×10(-3)mm Hg(-1) vs. 3.58±1.47×10(-3)mm Hg(-1), p<0.01; distal descending aorta [DDA]: 3.11±1.84×10(-3)mm Hg(-1) vs. 4.27±1.75×10(-3)mm Hg(-1), p<0.01); faster PWV (7.46±2.28m/s vs. 5.82±1.12m/s, p<0.05) and lower FMD (12.67%±6.49% vs. 20.66%±9.7%; p<0.01). Systolic blood pressure was an independent predictor of PWV, AA-AD, DDA-AD and FMD. FMD was statistically significantly associated with PWV (r=-0.37, p<0.01) and AD (p<0.01).Hypertension has a contributive effect on aortic stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in DM2 patients.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462301","annotations":[{"name":"Brachial artery","weight":0.906853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_artery"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.820796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Ascending aorta","weight":0.766667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_aorta"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.620865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.500223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.414701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Descending aorta","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_aorta"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.27118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.189064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Personal digital assistant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"},{"name":"Endothelial dysfunction","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelial_dysfunction"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Anno Domini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Foot-and-mouth disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-and-mouth_disease"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
