{"id":85809,"title":"The ATP7B genetic polymorphisms predict clinical outcome to platinum-based chemotherapy in lung cancer patients.","abstract":"This study aims to investigate the influence of ATP7B genetic polymorphism to platinum-based chemotherapy in Chinese Han lung cancer patients. A total of 338 Chinese Han lung cancer patients were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent at least two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Four tag SNPs of ATP7B (rs1061472, rs9535826, rs7999812, and rs9535828) were selected to evaluate their impacts to platinum-based chemotherapy in these patients. ATP7B rs9535828 and rs9535826 were found to be associated with platinum resistance in Chinese Han lung cancer patients. Patients with A allele in ATP7B rs9535828 presented an increased susceptibility to platinum drugs (OR 1.96, 95 % CI 1.17-3.30, p?<?0.01). Patients with G allele in ATP7B rs9535826 had the highest susceptibility to platinum drugs (OR 2.05, 95 % CI 1.19-3.52, p?<?0.01). Our findings suggest that ATP7B genetic polymorphisms could affect the therapeutic efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy, and ATP7B gene might be considered as predictive markers for the efficacy evaluation of platinum-based chemotherapy in Chinese Han lung cancer patients.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852429","annotations":[{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.756197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.578864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.538961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.480205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"China","weight":0.402165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.113728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Wilson disease protein","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_disease_protein"},{"name":"Han Dynasty","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dynasty"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.0169634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 338","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_338"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Island Explorer","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_Explorer"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"}]}
