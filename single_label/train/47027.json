{"id":47027,"title":"Synchronous colorectal carcinoma: a risk factor in colorectal cancer surgery.","abstract":"Synchronous colorectal carcinoma occurs in 1% to 8% of cases. There are little data on the impact of synchronous colorectal cancer on surgical treatment and short-term postoperative outcomes.The purpose of this work was to evaluate clinical characteristics and treatment patterns of synchronous colorectal carcinoma and their influence on short-term postoperative outcomes in comparison with solitary colorectal carcinoma.This was a population-based observational study. Patient and tumor characteristics, treatment patterns, and postoperative outcomes are described for patients with a solitary and synchronous colorectal carcinoma separately. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between synchronous colorectal carcinoma and postoperative complications in comparison with a solitary colorectal carcinoma.The study included in-hospital registration for the Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit.Patients were those with primary colorectal carcinoma from 2009 to 2011.Severe postoperative complications, reinterventions, and 30-day mortality were measured.Of 25,413 patients with colorectal cancer, 884 (3.5%) had synchronous colorectal tumors. Patients with synchronous colorectal carcinoma were older and more often of male sex compared with patients with solitary colorectal carcinoma. In ? 35% of cases, an extended surgical procedure was conducted (n = 310). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, synchronous colorectal carcinoma was associated with a higher risk of severe postoperative complications (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.20-1.63) and reinterventions (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.14-1.65) compared with solitary colorectal carcinoma but not with higher 30-day mortality (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.96-1.88).This study was limited by the data being self-reported. Case-mix adjustment was limited to information available in the data set, and no long-term outcome data were available.Synchronous colorectal carcinomas are prevalent in 3.5% of patients and require a different treatment strategy in comparison with solitary colorectal carcinoma. Postoperative outcomes are unfavorable, most likely because of extensive surgery.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24608302","annotations":[{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.730684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.729662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.682137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.625723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.481203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.39236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.354557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.331631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.17521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Licensure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensure"}]}
