{"id":36327,"title":"Correlation between grades of intraventricular hemorrhage and severity of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in perinatal asphyxia.","abstract":"This study was done to find out the correlation between various grades of Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH) and stages of HIE in perinatal asphyxia and to determine the short-term outcome of the affected baby. This observational study was conducted in Neonatal ward of Dhaka Shishu Hospital (DHS) and Dhaka Medical College Hospital for period of 37 months from January 2004 to January 2007. Total 189 perinatally asphyxiated babies were enrolled for HIE staging and cranial Ultrasonogram (USG) to find out grades of IVH. Finally 178 newborns were fulfilling all the necessary criteria for statistical analysis of the collected data on prescribed questionnaire. Among 178 perinatally asphyxiated newborns HIE stages - I, II, III were 50(28%), 10(56%) and 28(16%) respectively. Out of this 178 neonates total 50(28%) developed various grades IVH. Grades of IVH, I, II, III, IV were 15(30%), 18(36%), 10(20%) and 7(14%) respectively. There was significant correlation between the severity of HIE staging and grades of IVH. Short term outcome was poor in HIE-III, IVH grade III and IV. There is a direct relationship between different grades of IVH and stages of HIE. That is more the severe stages of HIE there is more chances to develop severe grades of IVH, Immediate morbidity and mortality is dependent on the grades of IVH and severity of stages of HIE.
