{"id":50420,"title":"Efficacy of Cisplatin-loaded poly butyl cyanoacrylate nanoparticles on the ovarian cancer: an in vitro study.","abstract":"One of the main challenges of treatment of ovarian cancer is initial response to treatment and then acquisition of resistance to Cisplatin. Nanotechnology-based approaches are considered as one way to overcome drug resistance. In this study, the cytotoxicity effects of Cisplatin-loaded poly butyl cyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles (NPs) on the ovarian cancer cell line A2780cp resistant to Cisplatin were studied. NPs were synthesized by miniemulsion polymerization method. Size, size distribution and zeta potential of NPs were estimated as 489 nm, 0.429, and -20 mV, respectively. Drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were recognized as 5 % and 25 %, respectively. Drug release pattern (3.18 % release after 51 h) demonstrated high level of retention. Toxicological studies showed that cytotoxicity of the nanodrug Cisplatin was about three times as much as that of a free drug. Moreover, NPs presented acceptable stability after 2 months. The results of study suggest the use of this formulation for in vivo experiments.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789433","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.721216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.684359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.618795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Polymerization","weight":0.615849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.555476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.542531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.350018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.299263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Cyanoacrylate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylate"},{"name":"Zeta potential","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_potential"},{"name":"Miniemulsion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniemulsion"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Zeta","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta"},{"name":"Cp (Unix)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp_(Unix)"},{"name":"Polyester","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Chemical stability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_stability"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Butyl cyanoacrylate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyl_cyanoacrylate"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Noun phrase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Butyl","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyl"}]}
