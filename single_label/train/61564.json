{"id":61564,"title":"Weekly chemotherapy with cisplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide followed by surgery for thymic carcinoma.","abstract":"We present our experience treating the patients with thymic carcinoma using induction chemotherapy according to weekly chemotherapy with cisplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide (CODE) followed by surgery.From January 2001 to December 2010, 17 patients were diagnosed as having thymic carcinoma at our hospital. We performed CODE chemotherapy for induction treatment followed by surgical resection in 7 of these patients.Seven patients consisted of 6 men and 1 woman, with an average age of 47.3 years (range 25-67 years). Five patients were clinically staged as Masaoka Stage III, and 2 were Stage IVa. A partial response was identified in 5 patients, and stable disease was observed in 2 patients. No cases of progressive disease were seen. Surgical resection was performed in all the patients: 6 underwent an R0 resection and 1 underwent an R1 resection. The estimated overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were both 80%, and the relapse-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 68.6% and 53.6% respectively.Induction chemotherapy using the CODE regimen, followed by a complete surgical resection can be performed with a promising survival outcome for patients with thymic carcinoma with borderline resectable lesions.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703656","annotations":[{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Etoposide","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoposide"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.732188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.469426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.352115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Thymus","weight":0.235355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"},{"name":"Progressive disease","weight":0.162218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.155098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.112458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0804499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"CODE (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODE_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"}]}
