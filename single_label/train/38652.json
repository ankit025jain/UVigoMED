{"id":38652,"title":"Rapid method for targeted prenatal diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Vietnam.","abstract":"Since there is no effective curative treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), prevention mostly depends on genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. About two-thirds of the affected patients have large deletions or duplications, which can be detected by multiplex ligation-dependent amplification (MLPA). The remaining cases include small mutations, which cannot be easily identified by routine techniques. In such cases, linkage analysis may be a useful tool for prenatal diagnosis. Here we compared results obtained from linkage using short tandem repeats (STRs) with those by MLPA and sequencing analysis.Eight Vietnamese pregnant women at risk of having a baby with DMD and requesting prenatal diagnosis were recruited in this study. MLPA and direct sequencing were applied to screen large rearrangements and point mutations in the dystrophin gene in the DMD probands and the fetal samples. STR linkage was also performed to analyze fetal mutation status.By MLPA and sequencing analysis, five DMD patients showed deletions of the dystrophin gene, and no deletions of exons were detected in seven amniotic fluid cell samples; one patient harbored the out-of-frame small deletion of exon 43, which was also found in the fetal sample of this family. STR analysis revealed the transmission of a mutant allele inside each family.Our results suggest that the combination of STR and MLPA could be a rapid, reliable, and affordable detection protocol for determination of the carrier's status and prenatal diagnosis of DMD in a developing country such as Vietnam.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
