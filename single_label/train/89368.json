{"id":89368,"title":"In vivo application of tissue-engineered blood vessels of bacterial cellulose as small arterial substitutes: proof of concept?","abstract":"Tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) represent an innovative approach for overcoming reconstructive problems associated with vascular diseases by providing small-caliber vascular grafts. This study aimed to evaluate a novel biomaterial of bacterially synthesized cellulose (BC) as a potential scaffold for small-diameter TEBV.Small-diameter blood vessels with a supramolecular fiber network structure consisting of tubular hydrogels from biodesigned cellulose were created using Gluconacetobacter strains and Matrix reservoir technology. BC tubes (length: 100 mm, inner diameter: 4.0-5.0 mm) were applied to replace the carotid arteries of 10 sheep for a period of 3 mo to gain further insights into (a) functional (in vivo) performance, (b) ability of providing a scaffold for the neoformation of a vascular wall and (c) their proinflammatory potential, and the (d) technical feasibility of the procedure.Preoperative analysis revealed a bursting strength of the grafts of approximately 800 mm Hg and suture retention strength of 4-5 N. Postexplantation analysis showed a patency rate of 50% (n = 5) and physiological performance of the patent grafts at 4, 8, and 12 wk postoperatively, compared with native arteries. Histologic analysis revealed a neoformation of a vascular wall-like structure along the BC scaffold consisting of immigrated vascular smooth muscle cells and a homogeneous endothelialization of the inner graft surface without signs of prothrombogenic or inflammatory potential. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a confluent luminal endothelial cell layer and the immigration of vascular smooth muscle cells into the BC matrix.BC grafts provide a scaffold for the neoformation of a three-layered vascular wall exhibit attractive properties for their use in future TEBV programs for cardiovascular surgery.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Wounds and
