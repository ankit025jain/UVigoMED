{"id":41577,"title":"Immunisations in Crohn's disease: who? why? what? when?","abstract":"Immunosuppression induced by drugs increase the risk of infections in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. The vaccination rate in CD patients is usually low due to inaccurate information concerning the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Vaccines and immunoglobulins, are artificial ways of protection from common infectious diseases and they have had a major effect on mortality. Herein we detail the need of protection induced by vaccines of measles, varicella, Zoster, papillomavirus, shingles, pneumococcal invasive disease, influenza, hepatitis A and B in CD at diagnosis and during the course of the disease even during immunosuppression periods but with different singularities. Vaccination in CD travellers and the matters related to immunization of household healthy members of immunosuppressed patients are also discussed.
