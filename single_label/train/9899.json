{"id":9899,"title":"Resveratrol attenuates the inflammatory reaction induced by ischemia/reperfusion in the rat heart.","abstract":"The role of resveratrol (Res) in inflammation induced by ischemia/reperfusion is not well understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Res modulates neutrophil accumulation and tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) induction in an ischemia/reperfusion-injured rat heart model. The rats were randomly exposed to sham surgery, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) alone, MI/R + Res, MI/R + Res + L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and MI/R + Res + methylene blue (MB). The results demonstrated that compared with MI/R, Res reduced the myocardial infarct area, myocardial myeloperoxidase levels, serum creatinine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and serum and myocardial TNF-? production. All the effects of Res demonstrated were inhibited by L-NAME (a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor) and MB [a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) inhibitor]. Thus, Res produces cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. These effects may be associated with an increase in NO production, the inhibition of neutrophil accumulation, TNF-? induction and cGMP signaling pathways in myocardium subjected to MI/R.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682318","annotations":[{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Cyclic guanosine monophosphate","weight":0.892566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_guanosine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Ester","weight":0.871618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"},{"name":"Nitric oxide","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.855989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.798286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.787139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.731945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.659725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.657939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.471683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.446357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Methylene blue","weight":0.38911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.345204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Methyl group","weight":0.341111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"},{"name":"Resveratrol","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Methylenes","weight":0.0428226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenes"},{"name":"Nitric acid","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"},{"name":"Guanosine monophosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_monophosphate"},{"name":"Oxide","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Synthase","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthase"},{"name":"Guanosine","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
