{"id":73593,"title":"Mirsynergy: detecting synergistic miRNA regulatory modules by overlapping neighbourhood expansion.","abstract":"Identification of microRNA regulatory modules (MiRMs) will aid deciphering aberrant transcriptional regulatory network in cancer but is computationally challenging. Existing methods are stochastic or require a fixed number of regulatory modules.We propose Mirsynergy, an efficient deterministic overlapping clustering algorithm adapted from a recently developed framework. Mirsynergy operates in two stages: it first forms MiRMs based on co-occurring microRNA (miRNA) targets and then expands each MiRM by greedily including (excluding) mRNAs into (from) the MiRM to maximize the synergy score, which is a function of miRNA-mRNA and gene-gene interactions. Using expression data for ovarian, breast and thyroid cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we compared Mirsynergy with internal controls and existing methods. Mirsynergy-MiRMs exhibit significantly higher functional enrichment and more coherent miRNA-mRNA expression anti-correlation. Based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we proposed several prognostically promising MiRMs and envisioned their utility in cancer research.Mirsynergy is implemented/available as an R/Bioconductor package at www.cs.utoronto.ca/?yueli/Mirsynergy.html.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894504","annotations":[{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.67526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Systems biology","weight":0.656281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.597719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.479414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Stochastic","weight":0.406674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.368379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Determinism","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Cancer research","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.100036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"The Cancer Genome Atlas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cancer_Genome_Atlas"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cryptanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis"},{"name":"Greedy algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Neighbourhood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood"},{"name":"R (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Internal control","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_control"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Enriched uranium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
