{"id":51198,"title":"Hypoxia-induced miR-210 in epithelial ovarian cancer enhances cancer cell viability via promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis.","abstract":"miR-210 is upregulated in a HIF-1?-dependent way in several types of cancers. In addition, upregulated miR-210 promotes cancer proliferation, via its anti-apoptotic effects. It is blind to the regulation of miR-210 under hypoxia conditions for ovarian cancer cells and to the effect of miR-210 on ovarian cancer growth. In the present study, we determined the expression of miR-210 in epithelial ovarian cancer specimens, and in ovarian cancer cell lines under hypoxia conditions, and determined in detail the effect of miR-210 overexpression on tumor cell proliferation, and the possible mechanisms of tumor growth by miR-210 regulation. It was shown that miR-210 expression is upregulated, in response to hypoxia conditions in epithelial ovarian cancer specimens as well as epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines, with an association to HIF-1? overexpression. Furthermore, upregulated miR-210 promoted tumor growth in vitro via targeting PTPN1 and inhibiting apoptosis. Therefore, our findings shed light on the mechanism of ovarian cancer adaptation to hypoxia.
