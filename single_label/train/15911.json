{"id":15911,"title":"Antibacterial activity of honey in north-west Pakistan against select human pathogens.","abstract":"To investigate the antimicrobial activity of commercially available honey and raw honey samples in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, against pathogenic bacterial strains.Well diffusion assays were performed to screen pure and diluted honey samples for antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative and six Gram-positive bacterial strains. Zones of inhibition were measured and compared with 10 mg Gentamycin.When honey samples were diluted to 20%-70%, the honey samples showed no activity to mild antibacterial activity. The highest antibacterial activity was recorded when 90% and pure undiluted honey samples were tested and compared with a control Gentamycin disc (10 mg).Commercially processed honey and raw honey samples from north-west of Pakistan possess good antimicrobial potential.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102696","annotations":[{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.689111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.657951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.466076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.399514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.300597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.144715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Honey","weight":0.129985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0804499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"2070s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2070s"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
