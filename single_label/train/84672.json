This is the third reported case worldwide on the terminal 2q deletion and trisomy of chromosome 15q syndrome. The findings in this case and our literature review, delineates the pattern of malformations secondary to trisomy of 15q and deletion of 2q.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25059013","annotations":[{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.730255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.730035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.701573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Chromosome 15 (human)","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_15_(human)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Dysmorphic feature","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmorphic_feature"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Romanian literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_literature"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"XY sex-determination system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Added tone chord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Added_tone_chord"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"}]}
