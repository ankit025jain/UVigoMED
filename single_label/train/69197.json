{"id":69197,"title":"Bone and mineral disorders after kidney transplantation: therapeutic strategies.","abstract":"Mineral and bone diseases (MBD) are common in patients with chronic kidney disease who undergo kidney transplantation. The incidence, types and severity of MBD vary according to the duration of chronic kidney disease, presence of comorbid conditions and intake of certain medications. Moreover, multiple types of pathology may be responsible for MBD. After successful reversal of uremia by kidney transplantation, many bone and mineral disorders improve, while immunosuppression, other medications, and new and existing comorbidities may result in new or worsening MBD. Chronic kidney disease is also common after kidney transplantation and may impact bone and mineral disease. In this article, we reviewed the prevalence, pathophysiology, and impact of MBD on post-transplant outcomes. We also discussed the diagnostic approach; immunosuppression management and potential treatment of MBD in kidney transplant recipients.
