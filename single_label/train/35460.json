{"id":35460,"title":"BACs-on-beads: a new robust and rapid detection method for prenatal diagnosis.","abstract":"Karyotyping, the gold standard used for diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities, is being progressively replaced by rapid aneuploidy testing (RAT) techniques such as quantitative fluorescence-PCR, FISH and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for diagnosing the common aneuploidies or chromosomal microarray analysis for comprehensive genome-wide testing. However, due to technical limitations, current RATs are confined to the detection of common aneuploidies 13, 18, 21 and sex chromosomes. To overcome the limitations of RATs, a bacterial artificial chromosomes-on-beads (BoBsâ„¢) assay technology has been introduced for the detection of the common aneuploidies as well as specific microdeletion syndromes. The BoBs assay is a bead-based multiplex assay using polystyrene beads impregnated with two spectrally distinct infrared fluorochromes to create a liquid array of up to 100 unique spectral signatures that supports the analysis of that scale of simultaneous hybridization assays on a minute DNA sample. This review gives an overview on the collective experiences of BoBs applications in prenatal diagnosis.
