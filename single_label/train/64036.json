{"id":64036,"title":"Efficacy and safety of rituximab in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis enrolled in a French Society of Rheumatology registry.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of rituximab (RTX) as a function of patient age.We included all rheumatoid arthritis patients in the AutoImmunity and Rituximab registry with a 2-year followup.Of the 1,709 patients, 191 were age ?75 years, 417 were ages 65–74 years, 907 were ages 50–64 years, and 194 were age <50 years. At baseline, the elderly and very elderly patients presented with longer disease duration, a higher incidence of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, a lower incidence of previous tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF?) therapy, and a smaller number of previously used TNF? agents. Disease activity, rheumatoid factor (RF), or anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies and corticosteroid therapy were not statistically different among the groups. At 24 months, no significant difference was shown among the groups for RTX discontinuation rates (36.1% if age <50 years, 32.6% if ages 50–64 years, 34.5% if ages 65–74 years, and 32.5% if age >75 years). The reasons for discontinuation (inefficacy, adverse events) were the same in all 4 groups. Infections were more common in the elderly. Patients ages 65–75 years were more likely to be good responders than nonresponders at 1 year of followup than patients age ?75 years (odds ratio 3.81, 95% confidence interval 1.14–12.79) after adjustment on disease duration, RF/anti-CCP positivity, corticosteroids, anti-TNF use, and baseline Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28). After the sixth month, the decrease in DAS28 score was less marked in the population age >75 years than in the group age <50 years.The efficacy and safety of RTX is affected by age.","date":"2014-10-08","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299001","annotations":[{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Rheumatoid arthritis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.889213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Rheumatoid factor","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_factor"},{"name":"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate","weight":0.870536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrocyte_sedimentation_rate"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.684582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Rheumatology","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.498165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.366051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.214498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0381889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Sedimentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
