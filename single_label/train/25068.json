{"id":25068,"title":"Perioperative management of oral anticoagulants: a focus on target-specific oral anticoagulants.","abstract":"Although warfarin has historically been the dominant oral anticoagulant, newer target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) have been introduced in the marketplace in the past few years. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, collectively referred to as TSOACs, have undergone extensive testing in comparison with warfarin and other anticoagulants for a variety of conditions. Compared with warfarin, the shorter time to peak effect, shorter half-life, and fewer drug-drug interactions have helped make the TSOACs attractive alternatives to warfarin for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease associated with orthopedic surgery and atrial fibrillation as well as for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. However, their unique properties pose a challenge for their management in the perioperative period. This article reviews the current guideline-based approach to perioperative management of anticoagulants, the clinical data, and the recommendations supporting use of the TSOACs in the perioperative period. The article also addresses common pitfalls in their perioperative management. By understanding a few key properties of the new oral anticoagulants and with careful perioperative planning, physicians can ensure that their patients will safely undergo most surgical procedures with minimal disruption of their chronic anticoagulation.
