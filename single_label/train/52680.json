{"id":52680,"title":"Anti-diabetic effect of a combination of andrographolide-enriched extract of Andrographis paniculata (Burm f.) Nees and asiaticoside-enriched extract of Centella asiatica L. in high fructose-fat fed rats.","abstract":"Traditionally, a combination of medicinal plants is commonly used for lowering blood glucose in diabetic patients in order to provide additional benefits of the single drug. A. paniculata and C. asiatica are two traditional medicines form South Asian and Southeast Asain countries consumed by people for treating daibates mellitus and its complications. Hyperglycemia in the rats was stimulated by high fructose-fat diet that consists of 36% fructose, 15% lard, and 5% egg yolks in 0.36 g/200 g body weight for 70 days. The rats were orally administered with the combination of andrographolide-enriched extract of A. paniculata (AEEAP) leaves and asiaticoside-enriched extract of C. asiatica (AEECA) herbs from day 70 for 7 days. Antidiabetic activity was evaluated by estimating mainly the blood glucose levels and other parameters such as HDL, LDL, cholesterol and triglyceride. The results showed that combination at the ratio of 70:30 exhibited a promosing antidiabetic effect in high-fat-fructose-fed rat, and exhibited sinergistic effects on blood cholesterol and HDL levels. It can be concluded that its antidiabetic effect was better than that of single treatment of AEEAP or AEECA. That combination was also potential to develop as a blood glucose-lowering agent for diabetic patients.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579376","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Lard","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lard"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Fructose","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Low-density lipoprotein","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.708461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"South Asia","weight":0.473934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.423619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Egg yolk","weight":0.298387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_yolk"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.290163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.28755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.202638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.183005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Traditional medicine","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.035579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"}]}
