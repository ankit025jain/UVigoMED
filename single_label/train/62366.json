{"id":62366,"title":"Unusual radiologic and histologic manifestations of primary pulmonary lymphoma.","abstract":"Pulmonary parenchymal involvement in lymphoma is unusual and is reported more commonly in Hodgkin's disease than non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Radiological appearances are manifold and may mimic other pulmonary diseases. We report the case of a patient with Hodgkin's disease who demonstrated multiple cavitating lung lesions with aberrant immunophenotypic expression of T-cell antigens.
