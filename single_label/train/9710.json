{"id":9710,"title":"Piperine enhances the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapy for triple-negative breast cancer cells.","abstract":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is most the aggressive type of breast cancer and is poorly responsive to endocrine therapeutics; however, one of the most attractive treatments is tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-based therapies. To identify compounds that enhance the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies, we screened 55 compounds from natural products in combination with TRAIL in TNBC cells.Human TNBC cells, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and murine TNBC cells, 4T1, were used. Cell viability, apoptotic cells, and cell cycle were quantified by the WST-1 assay, annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycinD (7-AAD) staining and Propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. In vivo effects of piperine were evaluated in the orthotopic-inoculated 4T1-luc mouse model.After screening, we identified piperine as the most potent adjuvant at enhancing the efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, which might be mediated through inhibition of survivin and p65 phosphorylation.Piperine may enhance TRAIL-based therapeutics for TNBC.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692724","annotations":[{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.849646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.841687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.818972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.796829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.765589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.751649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.742155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.619871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.546869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.502871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.477054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.364764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.2922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.272203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Natural product","weight":0.2352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_product"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.20327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Piperine","weight":0.152428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperine"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Iodide","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodide"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Cell (journal)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(journal)"},{"name":"Propidium iodide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propidium_iodide"},{"name":"Survivin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivin"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"RELA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RELA"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Probiotic","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probiotic"},{"name":"Trail","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
