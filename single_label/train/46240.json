{"id":46240,"title":"Impact of peri-operative bevacizumab on survival in patients with resected colorectal liver metastases: an analysis of the LiverMetSurvey.","abstract":"Peri-operative chemotherapy is recommended for the management of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). The aim of this study was to examine the impact of peri-operative bevacizumab on survival in patients with resected CRLM.A multicentre retrospective cohort of patients with resected CRLM was analysed from the LiverMetSurvey Registry. Patients who received peri-operative FOLFOX (group A) were compared with those who received peri-operative FOLFOX and bevacizumab (group B).In total, 501 patients were compared (A, n = 384; B, n = 117). Group A was older (68.3 versus 62.5 years, P < 0.01), had more rectal cancers (30.7 versus 18.8%, P < 0.01) and higher carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels at diagnosis (17.0 versus 9.7?ng/ml, P = 0.043). No difference was observed regarding primary tumour stage, synchronicity and the number or size of metastases. Post-operative infections were more frequent in group B (4.7% versus 12.8%, P < 0.01). Peri-operative bevacizumab had no effect on 3-year overall survival (OS) (76.4% versus 79.8%, P = 0.334), or disease-free survival (DFS) (7.4% versus 7.9%, P = 0.082). DFS was negatively associated with primary tumour node positivity (P = 0.011) and synchronicity (P = 0.041).The addition of bevacizumab to standard peri-operative chemotherapy does not appear to be associated with improved OS or DFS in patients with resected CRLM.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641317","annotations":[{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"FOLFOX","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOLFOX"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.807909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.768342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.645783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.639362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.618059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.505656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Synchronicity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"384","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/384"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Positivity effect","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity_effect"},{"name":"Hawker Hart","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Hart"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"}]}
