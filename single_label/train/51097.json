{"id":51097,"title":"Thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS) in the diagnostic value of thyroid nodules: a systematic review.","abstract":"This review was to assess the overall diagnostic accuracy of thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS) classification in the differentiated diagnosis of patients with thyroid nodules. The diagnostic accuracy of TI-RADS was identified by using data from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and other databases, which was from Jan 1966 to Dec 2013. Meta-analysis methods were used to obtain pooled sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratio, positive likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and summary receiver operating characteristic curves. A total of five studies with 7,753 thyroid nodules enrolled met the inclusion criteria in this meta-analysis. TI-RADS had a pooled sensitivity of 0.75 (95 % confidence interval 0.72-0.78) and a pooled specificity of 0.69 (95 % confidence interval 0.68-0.70). The pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 24.28 (95 % confidence interval 14.25-41.38). The overall area under the curve was 0.9177, and the Q* index was 0.8304. The TI-RADS classification was the accurate diagnostic technique for differentiating thyroid nodules.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722822","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.870774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.831493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.809429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.749851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.715166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.482994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.436161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.365937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing","weight":0.181975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_ratios_in_diagnostic_testing"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Statistical classification","weight":0.0625596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"753","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/753"},{"name":"680","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/680"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Method of characteristics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_characteristics"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Derivative","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Thyroid nodule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_nodule"},{"name":"Data system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_system"}]}
