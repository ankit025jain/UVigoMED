{"id":3712,"title":"Efficacy of saam acupuncture treatment on improvement of immune cell numbers in cancer patients: a pilot study.","abstract":"To collect preliminary data on the effects of Saam acupuncture with regard to the immunity in cancer patients.Ten cancer patients were analyzed for improvements in immunity. Acupuncture was applied at the 5 acupuncture points, Jingqu (LU 8), Zutonggu (BL 66), Yanggu (SI 5), Yangchi (TE 4), and Zhongwan (CV 12) for 2 weeks with 4 sessions. We assessed the effect of Korean Saam acupuncture on the immune system in cancer patients by measuring particular blood cell subsets, including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD56+ cells, as well as total white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and fatigue score. The measurement was performed before and after acupuncture and at a 2-week follow-up.There was a statistically significant increase in the number of CD3+ (P = 0.023) and CD8+ cells (P < 0.001) and T-cell subsets, as well as a decrease in the fatigue severity scale (FSS) score (P = 0.001) after Saam acupuncture using the 5 acupoints.Acupuncture may improve the immune system by increasing the counts of a few immune cells and relieve fatigue in cancer patients by decreasing FSS scores. Although this was a non-controlled study, it constitutes preliminary research investigating the potential effects of Saam acupuncture in increasing the counts of several immune cells in cancer patients.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417404","annotations":[{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Cancer-related fatigue","weight":0.847842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer-related_fatigue"},{"name":"CD19","weight":0.841043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD19"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.764111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.722247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.696163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.623759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.580041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.514821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Neural cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"CD3 (immunology)","weight":0.319797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD3_(immunology)"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Absolute neutrophil count","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_neutrophil_count"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"White blood cell count","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell_count"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"}]}
