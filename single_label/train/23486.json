{"id":23486,"title":"Comparative evaluation of three immunochromatographic identification tests for culture confirmation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.","abstract":"The rapid identification of acid-fast bacilli recovered from patient specimens as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) is critically important for accurate diagnosis and treatment. A thin-layer immunochromatographic (TLC) assay using anti-MPB64 or anti-MPT64 monoclonal antibodies was developed to discriminate between MTC and non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM). Capilia TB-Neo, which is the improved version of Capilia TB, is recently developed and needs to be evaluated.Capilia TB-Neo was evaluated by using reference strains including 96 Mycobacterium species (4Â MTC and 92 NTM) and 3 other bacterial genera, and clinical isolates (500 MTC and 90 NTM isolates). M. tuberculosis isolates tested negative by Capilia TB-Neo were sequenced for mpt64 gene.Capilia TB-Neo showed 100% agreement to a subset of reference strains. Non-specific reaction to M. marinum was not observed. The sensitivity and specificity of Capilia TB-Neo to the clinical isolates were 99.4% (99.6% for M. tuberculosis, excluding M. bovis BCG) for clinical MTC isolates and 100% for NTM isolates tested, respectively. Two M. tuberculosis isolates tested negative by Capilia TB-Neo: one harbored a 63-bp deletion in the mpt64 gene and the other possessed a 3,659-bp deletion from Rv1977 to Rv1981c, a region including the entire mpt64 gene.Capilia TB-Neo is a simple, rapid and highly sensitive test for identifying MTC, and showed better specificity than Capilia TB. However, Capilia TB-Neo still showed false-negative results with mpt64 mutations. The limitation should be recognized for clinical use.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484470","annotations":[{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.806321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.767603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.659617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bacilli","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacilli"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.572261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Mycobacterium marinum","weight":0.373431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_marinum"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.357647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.148859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Mycobacterium bovis","weight":0.143205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_bovis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis_complex"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"1977","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977"},{"name":"BCG vaccine","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCG_vaccine"}]}
