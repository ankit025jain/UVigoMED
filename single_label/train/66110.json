{"id":66110,"title":"Prostate cancer: performance characteristics of combined T?W and DW-MRI scoring in the setting of template transperineal re-biopsy using MR-TRUS fusion.","abstract":"To measure the performance characteristics of combined T2-weighted (T?W) and diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suspicion scoring prior to MR-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion template transperineal (TTP) re-biopsy.Thirty-nine patients referred for prostate re-biopsy, with prior MRI examinations, were retrospectively included. The MR images, including T?W and DW-MRI, had been independently evaluated prospectively by two radiologists using a structured scoring system. An MR-TRUS fusion TTP re-biopsy was used for MR target and non-targeted biopsy cores. Targeting performance and correlation with disease status were evaluated on a per-patient and per-region basis.The cancer yield was 41% (16/39 patients). MR targeting accurately detected the disease in 12/16 (75%) cancerous patients and missed the disease in 4/16 (25%) patients, all with Gleason 3?+?3 disease. There was a significant relationship (P?<?0.01) between MR suspicion score and the significance of cancer. Reader 1 had significantly higher sensitivity in the transition zone (TZ; 0.84) compared with the peripheral zone (PZ; 0.32) (P?=?0.04). Inter-reader agreement was moderate for the PZ and substantial for the TZ.MRI targeting is beneficial in the setting of TTP MR-TRUS fusion re-biopsy and MR suspicion score relates to prostate cancer clinical significance. A T?W and DW-MRI structured scoring system results in good inter-reader agreement in this setting.• Pre-biopsy MRI aids the detection of high significance cancer during prostate re-biopsy. • MRI suspicion level correlates with the clinical significance of prostate cancer detected. • T?W and DW-MRI structured scoring of pre-biopsy MRI permits good inter-reader agreement.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24744197","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate
