{"id":4020,"title":"[Effect of T-lymphocytes and interferon-gamma on the stages of multicellular tumor spheroids formation in vitro].","abstract":"In our work we studied the effect of T lymphocytes and interferon-gamma on the vital activity of the breast cancer cells population and formation of multicellular tumor spheroids. We demonstrated the stages of multicellular tumor spheroids formation and the possible ways to implement antitumor influence of T lymphocytes and interferon-gamma through a change in estrogen receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Our results shown a correlation between the type of humoral influance, the degree of expression of estrogen receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor and the intensity of tumor microaggregates formation.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25318173","annotations":[{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.805725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Multicellular organism","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.751693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.549702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Vitalism","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"}]}
