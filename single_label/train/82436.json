{"id":82436,"title":"Restorative orthodontic treatment approach in the correction of anterior proclination in special cases (Port Harcourt-Onyeaso appliance): two case reports.","abstract":"Removable orthodontic appliance may be indicated in the management of anterior proclination and increased overjet especially in the younger age group. Generally, proclined maxillary incisors are prone to trauma in young active children. This makes prompt preventive and interceptive intervention very necessary. This condition is complicated in the event of associated trauma to such tooth/teeth that could require orthodontic tooth movement.The first report involves a 12-year-old boy who presented three years ago with loss of his two central incisors due to traumatic avulsion. The second report is a 10- year-old boy who presented a year ago with a dento alveolar abscess in relation to a long standing Ellis class III and class II fractures on the maxillary right and left central incisors, respectively. In both cases two different innovative management procedures were undertaken which combined restorative and orthodontic procedures concurrently, which helped the children psychologically in school. The first has been discharged to continue with the appliance as both a retainer and a denture while the second has completed an acceptable dental restoration and is still receiving orthodontic care with satisfactory progress.These innovative procedures yielded good results. Both patients and parents were very co-operative and appreciative of the outcomes.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624642","annotations":[{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.891484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.675491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.567113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.548361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.525309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.506284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.442888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.406238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Orthodontic technology","weight":0.363972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontic_technology"},{"name":"Incisor","weight":0.353835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.26113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.102441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Maxillary central incisor","weight":0.0372292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_central_incisor"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Overbite","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overbite"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Retainer (orthodontics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retainer_(orthodontics)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"},{"name":"Classes of United States Senators","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"}]}
