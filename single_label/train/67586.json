{"id":67586,"title":"Optimizing blood pressure control in patients with nondiabetic glomerular disease.","abstract":"Hypertension is a common problem among patients with glomerular disease and CKD. Optimal blood pressure targets for these patients have been the source of much debate. Careful review of the available data supports a blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mmHg. Consideration for a lower goal of less than 130/80 mmHg should be given for patients with heavy proteinuria. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors should be used as the cornerstone of therapy for all patients with glomerular disease and CKD.
