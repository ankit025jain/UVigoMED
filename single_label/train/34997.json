{"id":34997,"title":"Reducing hypothermia in preterm infants following delivery.","abstract":"Moderate hypothermia (temperature <36°C) at birth is common in premature infants and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity.A multidisciplinary practice plan was implemented to determine in premature infants <35 weeks old whether a multifaceted approach would reduce the number of inborn infants with an admitting axillary temperature <36°C by 20% without increasing exposure to a temperature >37.5°C. The plan included use of occlusive wrap a transwarmer mattress and cap for all infants and maintaining an operating room temperature between 21°C and 23°C. Data were obtained at baseline (n = 66), during phasing in (n = 102), and at full implementation (n = 193).Infant axillary temperature in the delivery room (DR) increased from 36.1°C ± 0.6°C to 36.2°C ± 0.6°C to 36.6°C ± 0.6°C (P < .001), and admitting temperature increased from 36.0°C ± 0.8°C to 36.3°C ± 0.6°C to 36.7°C ± 0.5°C at baseline, phasing in, and full implementation, respectively (P < .001). The number of infants with temperature <36°C decreased from 55% to 6.2% at baseline versus full implementation (P < .001), and intubation at 24 hours decreased from 39% to 17.6% (P = .005). There was no increase in the number of infants with a temperature >37.5°C over time. The use of occlusive wrap, mattress, and cap increased from 33% to 88% at baseline versus full implementation. Control charts showed significant improvement in DR ambient temperature at baseline versus full implementation.The practice plan was associated with a significant increase in DR and admitting axillary infant temperatures and a corresponding decrease in the number of infants with moderate hypothermia. There was an associated reduction in intubation at 24 hours. These positive findings reflect increased compliance with the practice plan.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685958","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.831559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.573883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.487806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Temperature","weight":0.42324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.376526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Room temperature","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Plosive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive"},{"name":"Data (Star Trek)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Phasing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasing"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Digital Transmission Content Protection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Transmission_Content_Protection"},{"name":"Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Cambridge_Catalogue_of_Radio_Sources"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Cap (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Seventh Cambridge Survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Cambridge_Survey"},{"name":"Alfa Romeo 6C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa_Romeo_6C"},{"name":"5-HT2C receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"1C Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1C_Company"},{"name":"Ambient music","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Mattress","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattress"}]}
