{"id":53338,"title":"Omentin and chemerin and their association with obesity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.","abstract":"We aimed to investigate whether overweight/obesity is associated with omentin and chemerin. The study group consisted of 81 women with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) (41 lean, BMI?<?25?kg/m² and 40 overweight or obese, BMI?>?25?kg/m²) and 61 healthy subjects (31 lean, BMI?<?25?kg/m² and 30 overweight or obese, BMI?>?25?kg/m²; control group). The clinical, endocrine, metabolic parameters, plasma omentin and chemerin levels were measured in patients and compared to control. In all subjects with PCOS (n?=?80), serum chemerin levels were higher compared with those of the controls (n?=?58) (7.71?±?1.78?ng/mL versus 6.94?±?0.82?ng/mL, p?=?0.003). However, serum omentin levels were not significantly different between the PCOS subjects and the controls (1.55?±?0.43?ng/mL versus 1.69?±?0.37?ng/mL, p?=?0.056). The mean chemerin concentrations were significantly elevated in the obese PCOS group compared with the obese control subjects (8.98?±?1.45?ng/mL versus 7.02?±?0.67?ng/mL, p?=?0.000) and the nonobese PCOS group compared with the obese control subjects (6.57?±?1.17?ng/mL versus 7.02?±?0.67?ng/mL, p?=?0.000). In conclusion, fat mass seems to be the main determinant factor of increased chemerin and decreased omentin in women with PCOS.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524360","annotations":[{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.864441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.791143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.765535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.751649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.746385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.701284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Chemerin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemerin"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"711","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/711"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Uncial 056","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_056"}]}
