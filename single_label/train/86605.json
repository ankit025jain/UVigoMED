The ITF contains the most invasive cells of a tumor, and has a high prognostic value in carcinoma. The aim of this study is to investigate the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation phenotype in ITF cells of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and analyze the relationship between clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes of patients.Semiquantitative immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and ?-catenin) and mesenchymal marker (vimentin) in 104 lung SCC tumor tissues.A decrease in E-cadherin expression in ITF cells was observed in 56 of 104 (53.8%) tumors from patients. This result was markedly lower than that of non-ITF cells, which eventually developed metastatic tumors and were also associated with death (P=0.04). Vimentin expression was observed in 44 of 104 (42.3%) ITF cells, which was much higher than that of non-ITF cells. The downregulation of E-cadherin and overexpression of vimentin were associated with tumor invasive pattern, lymphatic metastasis, and poor prognosis (P<0.01). The expression of ?-catenin was 67.3% (70/104) in ITF cells. Moreover, ITF cells showed more nuclear and plasma-positive cells, which were closely associated with metastasis (P<0.01).The loss in expression of E-cadherin/?-catenin and overexpression of vimentin in ITF cells may be associated with poor prognosis of lung SCC patients.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758906","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.834958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.744594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.636922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.619349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.610066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.578454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Vimentin","weight":0.480374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimentin"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.341937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.122449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0229663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Catenin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenin"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Emergency medical technician","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician"}]}
