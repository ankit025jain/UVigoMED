{"id":43113,"title":"[Applied rigid choledochoscope and pneumatic lithotripsy in targeting treatment of hepatolithiasis guided by three-dimensional visualization technology].","abstract":"To study the value of rigid choledochoscope and pneumatic lithotripsy in targeting treatment of hepatolithiasis under the guidance of three-dimensional visualization technology.The 26 patients with hepatolithiasis from February 2012 to June 2013 were analyzed. There were 11 male and 15 female patients with a median age of 55.2 years (range 31-75 years old). The image data of CT scanning of hepatolithiasis were introduced into medical image three-dimensional visualization system (MI-3DVS) for three-dimensional reconstruction, 3D classifications of hepatolithiasis were obtained based on it. Applied rigid choledochoscope and pneumatic lithotripsy in targeting treatment of hepatolithiasis guided by three-dimensional visualization technology.The 26 patients (29 times) experienced targeting treatment of rigid choledochoscope and pneumatic lithotripsy under the guidance of three-dimensional visualization technology, including:19 cases (4 cases of type IIc) through percutaneous biliary tract sinus, laparoscopic surgery 3 cases, laparotomy 4 cases. Three patients underwent surgery twice. The final stone clearance rate was 100%.One case confirmed combined with cholangiocarcinoma and transfer to radical resection.Intraoperative blood loss was (41.7 ± 8.5) ml, operating time was (100.8 ± 7.6) minutes, and postoperative hospital stay was (7.0 ± 0.6) days. A patient suffered postoperative biliary tract bleeding.Without bile duct injury, bleeding, bile leakage and other complications were occurred.Rigid choledochoscope and pneumatic lithotripsy in the treatment of hepatolithiasis under the guidance of three-dimensional visualization technology achieved digital minimally invasive treatment of hepatolithiasis, which can be a new approach to hepatobiliary surgery.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Digestive System
