{"id":45517,"title":"ESD around the world: Asia.","abstract":"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) improves the quality of life of patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) and dysplasia by preserving gastric function. ESD in the treatment of EGC and dysplasia has become standard in Japan and Korea and is being developed and implemented in many major centers in Asia. With a well-designed prospective study, long-term outcomes of expanded criteria for endoscopic resection of EGC are expected to provide reliable indications for endoscopic treatment. Ongoing and novel clinical investigations of minimally invasive approaches and close collaboration between Western and Asian countries are expected to establish the best way to treat EGC.
