{"id":57351,"title":"Crime is falling: how community practitioners can contribute to reducing crime and antisocial behaviour.","abstract":"International research has provided so much evidence concerning risk factors for, and protective factors against, children becoming involved in offending that a way of making sense of the data for practitioners, particularly health professionals, is called for. One such way has already appeared as a matrix. This paper updates that matrix, retaining original entries that are still pertinent and identifying recent evidence of risk and protective influences upon the foetus, infant and child. It also indicates promising interventions available to practitioners.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167727","annotations":[{"name":"Crime","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.549271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.418291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Anti-social behaviour","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Antisocial personality disorder","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Matrix (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Community development","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_development"}]}
