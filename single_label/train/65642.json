{"id":65642,"title":"A randomized clinical trial to determine optimal infertility treatment in older couples: the Forty and Over Treatment Trial (FORT-T).","abstract":"To determine the optimal infertility therapy for women at the end of their reproductive potential.Randomized clinical trial.Academic medical centers and private infertility center in a state with mandated insurance coverage.Couples with ? 6 months of unexplained infertility; female partner aged 38-42 years.Randomized to treatment with two cycles of clomiphene citrate (CC) and intrauterine insemination (IUI), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)/IUI, or immediate IVF, followed by IVF if not pregnant.Proportion with a clinically recognized pregnancy, number of treatment cycles, and time to conception after two treatment cycles and at the end of treatment.We randomized 154 couples to receive CC/IUI (N = 51), FSH/IUI (N = 52), or immediate IVF (N = 51); 140 (90.9%) couples initiated treatment. The cumulative clinical pregnancy rates per couple after the first two cycles of CC/IUI, FSH/IUI, or immediate IVF were 21.6%, 17.3%, and 49.0%, respectively. After all treatments, 110 (71.4%) of 154 couples had conceived a clinically recognized pregnancy, and 46.1% had delivered at least one live-born baby; 84.2% of all live-born infants resulting from treatment were achieved via IVF. There were 36% fewer treatment cycles in the IVF arm compared with either COH/IUI arm, and the couples conceived a pregnancy leading to a live birth after fewer treatment cycles.A randomized controlled trial in older women with unexplained infertility to compare treatment initiated with two cycles of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation/IUI versus immediate IVF demonstrated superior pregnancy rates with fewer treatment cycles in the immediate IVF group.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796764","annotations":[{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Clomifene","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene"},{"name":"Artificial insemination","weight":0.864161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.834373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.81484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.745092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Insemination","weight":0.574262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insemination"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.184458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Unexplained infertility","weight":0.136252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexplained_infertility"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Significant other","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_other"},{"name":"Vivipary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivipary"},{"name":"Citrate","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate"}]}
