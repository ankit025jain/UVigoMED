{"id":56793,"title":"Optical coherence tomography in the preoperative and postoperative management of macular hole and epiretinal membrane.","abstract":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis and treatment of macular diseases, including those of the vitreomacular interface. OCT enables accurate diagnosis and differentiation of full thickness macular hole, lamellar macular hole and epiretinal membrane, with or without the presence of vitreomacular adhesion. This information enables earlier diagnosis and treatment when necessary, and can guide the choice of therapy. OCT is useful to facilitate discussions with patients and manage the visual expectations. Postoperatively, OCT can be helpful to optimise patient comfort and visual outcomes. As the technology continues to improve, OCT will become increasingly critical for all aspects of care for patients with macular hole and epiretinal membrane.
