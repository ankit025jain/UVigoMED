{"id":51200,"title":"Lesson of the month (1): cabergoline - 'i eat funny on that'.","abstract":"We present the case of a patient treated for hyperprolactinaemia with weekly doses of cabergoline for 12 years. Over this time she had suffered from binge eating and compulsive shopping which impacted on her weight and made her finances precarious. We discuss the features of impulse control disorders and suggest that seeking out these side effects in patients taking such agents is important. The behaviours may be embarrassing and patients may not volunteer them, likewise if the doctor dismisses them they may continue unabated, causing significant social harm.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715137","annotations":[{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.521073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.429832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Deferred gratification","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_gratification"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Compulsive behavior","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_behavior"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Hyperprolactinaemia","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperprolactinaemia"},{"name":"Cabergoline","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabergoline"},{"name":"Compulsive buying disorder","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_buying_disorder"},{"name":"Binge eating","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_eating"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Shopping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping"},{"name":"Lesson","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesson"},{"name":"Impulse control disorder","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_control_disorder"}]}
