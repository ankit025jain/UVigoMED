{"id":80636,"title":"A retrospective examination of paleoparasitology and its establishment in the Journal of Parasitology.","abstract":"Volume 95 (2009) of the Journal of Parasitology represented a significant benchmark in the history of paleoparasitology when it received on the cover formal recognition as a topical area for publication. This retrospective examination chronicles the emergence of paleoparasitology, from its origins as an adjunct contribution to the study of prehistoric human populations to its modern expression as a sub-disciplinary interest. The aim of paleoparasitology is to elucidate the temporal and spatial dimensions of parasitism from the fossil record of human and non-human host populations.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588553","annotations":[{"name":"History","weight":0.542097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Prehistory","weight":0.396194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.141923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Fossil","weight":0.0711236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Publication","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Presenter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenter"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Parasitology","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitology"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Specification (technical standard)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)"}]}
