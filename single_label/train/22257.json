{"id":22257,"title":"[Trends in the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infection in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea: multicenter study over 13 years].","abstract":"The eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infection have been reported to have decreased over the years due to antibiotics resistance. The aim of this study is to investigate the trend of eradication rates of first-line triple therapy for H. pylori over the past 13 year period, and to evaluate factors affecting H. pylori eradication in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea.A total of 2,982 patients with H. pylori infection who were treated with either 1 week or 2 weeks first-line therapy (proton pump inhibitor [PPI], amoxicillin, and clarithromycin) from January 1999 through December 2011 were included in this study. Data were collected by retrospectively reviewing the medical records.The overall H. pylori eradication rate was 87.2%. The eradication rates from 1999 to 2011 fluctuated between 78.0% and 95.7%, but no definite evidence of a decreasing tendency was seen over the 13 year period (p=0.113). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the eradication rate according to the duration of therapy (p=0.592). However, there was a significant difference in the eradication rate among various PPIs (p<0.01).There was no decreasing trend in the H. pylori eradication rate over the past 13 years in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea. There also was no difference in the eradication rates depending on duration of therapy. However, a significant difference was noted among various PPIs.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561694","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.923416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Clarithromycin","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarithromycin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.70277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.589373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.297409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.127267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.118447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Gyeongsangbuk-do","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongsangbuk-do"},{"name":"Daegu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daegu"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"592","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/592"},{"name":"982","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/982"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Trends (short story)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_(short_story)"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Bear market","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_market"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
