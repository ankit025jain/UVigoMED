{"id":82424,"title":"[Chewing impairment and associated factors among adults].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of chewing impairment according to sex, and its associated factors in adults.A cross-sectional population-based study was carried out with 2,016 subjects aged between 20 and 59 years in Florianopolis, SC, Southern Brazil, in 2009. The sampling was undertaken in two stages, census tracts and households. The outcome 'chewing impairment' was obtained from the question \"How often do you have chewing impairment due to teeth or denture problems?\". Analyses were carried out with demographics and socioeconomic factors, dental services utilization, and self-related oral health using multivariable logistic regression and stratified by sex.The response rate was 85.3% (1,720 adults). The prevalence of chewing impairment was 13,0% (95%CI 10.3;15.8) and 18,0% (95%CI 14.6;21.3) among men and women, respectively. Women and men fifty years old and over, who had ten or fewer natural teeth and those who reported toothache were more likely to have chewing impairment. The combination of tooth loss and toothache on chewing impairment was almost four times higher among women.The magnitude of the associations among socioeconomic, demographics and self-related oral health factors was different according to sex, in general higher for women, with emphasis on toothache. The findings suggest that the impact of oral conditions varies by sex.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626541","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.695352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.589692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Dentures","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentures"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.237827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Toothache","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothache"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.218346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Florianopolis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florianopolis"},{"name":"South Region, Brazil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil"},{"name":"Tooth loss","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"South Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"720","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Census tract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Multivariable calculus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
