{"id":72702,"title":"From cancer genomics to precision oncology--tissue's still an issue.","abstract":"Rapidly evolving genome technology has enabled extensive molecular analysis of limited tumor biopsy material, thereby facilitating the broader implementation of personalized cancer medicine. However, genomics-based patient stratification across diverse tumor types is unlikely to supplant tissue-of-origin considerations in addressing clinical needs, including the development and application of novel \"rationally targeted\" cancer therapies.
