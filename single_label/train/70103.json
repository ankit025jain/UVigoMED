{"id":70103,"title":"Diagnosis of cancer in rural Rwanda: early outcomes of a phased approach to implement anatomic pathology services in resource-limited settings.","abstract":"Adequate pathology services are a prerequisite to accurate cancer diagnoses and tailoring appropriate treatment. Limitations in skilled personnel and infrastructure are among the challenges faced by developing countries. We describe a stepwise implementation of anatomic pathology laboratory services at Butaro District Hospital, designated as a Cancer Center of Excellence in rural Rwanda.The phased approach to developing pathology services up to December 2012 is described. A retrospective review of specimens submitted to Butaro District Hospital between July 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, was conducted. Patient clinical characteristics and sociodemographics are also described.During the study period, a total of 437 tissue specimens were submitted. Among these, 143 (32.7%) were from male patients, 244 (55.8%) were confirmed as malignant, 163 (37.3%) were benign, 28 (6.4%) were inconclusive, and two (0.5%) results were not available at the time of analysis. The median time from specimen receipt at Butaro to final reporting was 32 days (range, 7-193 days; interquartile range, 23-44 days).Our experience demonstrates that anatomic pathology services can be established in resource-limited settings and local capacity can be built to support accurate diagnoses. Our approach included leveraging partnerships, volunteer experts, and task shifting and will be expanded to include telepathology.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239422","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anatomical pathology","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.589611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.573664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.473664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.472268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.33322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Telepathology","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Volunteering","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Partnership","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Rwanda","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"July 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_1"},{"name":"244","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/244"},{"name":"Tailor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Homeland Security Centers of Excellence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_Security_Centers_of_Excellence"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Receipt","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receipt"},{"name":"Leverage (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Steps and skips","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_and_skips"},{"name":"Study hall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_hall"},{"name":"Minuscule 2344","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_2344"}]}
