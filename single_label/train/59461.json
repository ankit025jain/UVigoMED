{"id":59461,"title":"Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of astemizole on cervical cancer cells.","abstract":"Cervical cancer is a major cause of mortality among women in developing countries. Thus, it is necessary to offer novel therapies to treat this malignancy. Astemizole has been suggested as a novel and interesting anticancer agent because it targets several proteins involved in cancer including Eag1 (ether Ã -go-go-1) potassium channels. Eag1 has been proposed as a tumor marker for different types of cancer. Actually, we previously suggested Eag1 channels as cervical cancer and dysplasia markers. Besides, Eag1 has been proposed as a therapeutic target for different malignancies. However, the effect of astemizole in cervical cancer cells is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effect of astemizole on the proliferation and apoptosis of cervical cancer cells.Five cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, SiHa, CaSki, INBL, and C-33A) were cultured according to manufacturer's instructions. Eag1 protein expression was studied by immunocytochemistry. Cell proliferation was assayed with the MTT method, and apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry.Eag1 protein expression was observed in different cell lines. Astemizole decreased cell proliferation in up to 40% and increased apoptosis severalfold in all the cell lines studied.Our results suggest astemizole as a potential therapy for cervical cancer.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819656","annotations":[{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.899818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"HeLa","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.727131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.678479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.544114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ether","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.350615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.342331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Immunocytochemistry","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocytochemistry"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
