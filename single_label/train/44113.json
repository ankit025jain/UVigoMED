{"id":44113,"title":"Relevance of hepatitis B surface antigen levels in patients with chronic hepatitis B during 5 year of tenofovir treatment.","abstract":"The role of quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels in patients receiving highly potent oral antiviral therapy is controversial, and here, we determined the HBsAg response in 121 chronic hepatitis B patients treated with tenofovir 300 mg daily. During tenofovir treatment, HBsAg decline of ? 1.0 log from baseline was seen in 16.1%, 16.3%, 18.4%, 34.6%, 36.4% and 11.8%, 15.2%, 14.8%, 28.6%, 20% at years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, respectively. Early decline in HBsAg levels at week 4 was predictive of subsequent significant HBsAg level decline. HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 29.9% of HBeAg-positive patients. On multinomial logistic regression, HBsAg level decline from baseline at week 4 and week 12 or any time subsequently did not correlate with HBeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA level decline from baseline at week 4 and week 12 (OR = 3.704; 95% CI = 1.511-9.076; P = 0.006 and OR = 1.732; 95% CI = 1.032-2.867; P = 0.037, respectively) was significantly predictive of seroconversion. A small proportion of chronic HBV-infected patients treated with tenofovir exhibit a significant (? 1.0 log) decline in HBsAg levels. Early decline in HBsAg levels at week 4 was predictive of subsequent and significant HBsAg level decline. The HBsAg decline did not correlate with HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients. Reduction in HBV DNA levels at week 4 and 12 correlated with seroconversion.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750522","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.779493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.521643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.494426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.432167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.371072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tenofovir","weight":0.360578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenofovir"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.355374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.293421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.238155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.098427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Multinomial logit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logit"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"867","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867"},{"name":"732","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/732"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Logistic distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution"},{"name":"Multinomial distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"2011 Premier League Darts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Premier_League_Darts"}]}
