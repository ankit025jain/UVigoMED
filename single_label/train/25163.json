{"id":25163,"title":"Case report: upper extremity deep venous thrombosis in a 19-year-old baseball player.","abstract":"This report describes a case of a collegiate baseball player who presented with 3 weeks of worsening right shoulder pain and mild swelling and faint discoloration of the right arm and hand. He was found to have a nonocclusive clot on his brachial vein and was treated with anticoagulants. This was his second lifetime thrombosis. A hematologic workup revealed no evidence of a hereditary origin, and thrombosis was believed to be related to recent exertion (baseball throwing). Upper extremity deep vein thromboses are extremely uncommon. However, because they can have potentially life-threatening consequences, deep vein thromboses must be on the differential for any athlete who presents with increased pain, swelling, or discoloration of an extremity.","date":"2014-09-22","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25244713","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.55299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.507145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.49837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.489569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.376873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Baseball","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Brachial artery","weight":0.107422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_artery"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Brachial veins","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_veins"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Shoulder problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_problem"}]}
