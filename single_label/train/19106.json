{"id":19106,"title":"Warthin's tumor with superimposed mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.","abstract":"We report a case of atypical mycobacterium infection in a Warthin's tumor which occurred in a 79-year-old man. The patient had along history of a left parotid mass that underwent rapid growth, became painful, and fistulized. The patient underwent left parotidectomy and neck dissection which showed a Warthin's tumor with areas of necrotizing granulomas. Subsequent culture showed the growth of acid fast bacilli. Consideration of an underlying mycobacterium infection, although rare, is important due to the public health concerns and other treatment needs that such a diagnosis raises.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24741857","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.763194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mycobacterium","weight":0.734777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Acid-fast","weight":0.544126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid-fast"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.462303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.437493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.387409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.360544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Bacilli","weight":0.0955561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacilli"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
