{"id":61764,"title":"BCL2, BCL6, IGH, TP53, and MYC protein expression and gene rearrangements as prognostic markers in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a study of 44 Turkish patients.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of BCL2, BCL6, IGH, TP53, and MYC protein expression and rearrangements of the respective genes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients and to assess their prognostic values. Samples from 44 patients with DLBCL were evaluated using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses. BCL6 was the most rearranged gene (63.6%), followed by MYC (31.8%), TP53 (22.7%), and BCL2 (18.2%). Multiple rearrangements were detected in 40.9% of the cases. BCL6 was the most expressed protein (78.6%), followed by TP53 (69.04%), BCL2 (59.5%) and MYC (14.3%). Expression of multiple proteins was detected in 67.4% of the cases. BCL2 (P = .003) expression had a significant negative influence on overall survival,whereas BCL6 (P = .014) expression had a significant positive influence. Our results with a different pattern of gene rearrangements and associated protein overexpression indicate the molecular genetic complexity of DLBCLs, which reflects the morphologic, biologic, and clinical heterogeneity of these lymphomas.
