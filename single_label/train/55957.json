{"id":55957,"title":"An update on dry eye disease molecular treatment: advances in drug pipelines.","abstract":"Dry eye disease is a common disorder provoking changes in tear film and ocular surface. Untreated dry eye could cause ocular infections, corneal ulcer and blindness. Only a few drugs are authorized so far for the treatment of dry eye disease and the possibilities of evolution in this sector are immense. Consequently, a significant number of new potential solutions are under development or placed in the pharmaceutical pipeline, promising better results and lesser side effects.In this article, the corresponding literature and recent Phase III clinical trial data and the corresponding literature, for dry eye disease treatment are reviewed, revealing the new strategic movements in drug pipelines.From the clinical trial results, the advancement in tear substitutes and secretagogues in addressing specific deficiencies of tear components even though not resolving the underlying conditions of the disease is evident. The vast majority of new compounds under development are anti-inflammatories, steroids, non-steroids and antibiotics; however, there are also some novel lubricating drops and mucin-tear secretagogues. A future aggressive therapy for dry eye, depending on the severity of the symptoms, would include combinations of soft steroids, anti-inflammatories, such as cyclosporine A, with the addition of the new polyvalent mucin and tear secretagogues.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24773445","annotations":[{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.814519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.785256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.699037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.659079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.522641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.433551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.207942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Corneal ulcer","weight":0.0506351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_ulcer"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Lubricant","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubricant"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Prohibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Pipeline transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
