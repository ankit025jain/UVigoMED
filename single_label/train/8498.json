{"id":8498,"title":"MRI evaluation of BBB disruption after adjuvant AcSDKP treatment of stroke with tPA in rat.","abstract":"The primary limitation of thrombolytic treatment of ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the hemorrhagic risk. We tested AcSDKP (N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline), as an auxiliary therapeutic agent, to reduce blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in a combination tPA thrombolytic treatment of stroke. Wistar rats subjected to embolic stroke were randomly assigned to either the tPA monotherapy group (n=9) or combination of tPA and AcSDKP treatment group (n=9) initiated at 4 h after ischemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements were performed before and after the treatments. Immunohistochemical staining and measurements were performed to confirm MRI findings. Longitudinal MRI permeability measurements with gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) demonstrated that combination treatment of acute embolic stroke with AcSDKP and tPA significantly reduced BBB leakage, compared to tPA monotherapy, at 3 and 6 days (18.3±9.8 mm3 vs. 65.0±21.0 mm3, p<0.001) after the onset of stroke, although BBB leakage was comparable between the two groups prior to the treatments (6.8±4.4 mm3 vs. 4.3±3.3 mm3, p>0.18). The substantial reduction of BBB leakage observed in the combination treatment group was closely associated with reduced ischemic lesions measured by T2 maps (113.6±24.9 mm3 vs. 188.1±60.8 mm3, p<0.04 at 6 days). Histopathological analysis of the same population of rats showed that the combination treatment significantly reduced parenchymal fibrin deposition (0.063±0.059 mm2 vs. 0.172±0.103 mm2, p<0.03) and infarct volume (146.7±35.9 mm3 vs. 199.3±60.4 mm3, p<0.05) compared to the tPA monotherapy at 6days after stroke. MRI provides biological insight into the therapeutic benefit of combination treatment of stroke with tPA and AcSDKP 4h after onset, and demonstrates significantly improved cerebrovascular integrity with neuroprotective effects compared with tPA monotherapy.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769225","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.764111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.639713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.601131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.598635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Blood-brain barrier","weight":0.511526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.463282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.421342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.391689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.388493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.375952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.305641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.25896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.240123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Thrombolysis","weight":0.189675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombolysis"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.125945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0508123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.0242565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
