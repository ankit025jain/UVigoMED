{"id":60714,"title":"Assessment of leptin and resistin levels in non-obese multiple myeloma patients and their relation with Ig level and disease stage.","abstract":"Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for approximately 0.8% of all cancer diagnoses and 0.9% of cancer deaths. Leptin receptors were expressed on CD34(+) cells. Resistin receptors were expressed on inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines increase the expression of resistin on monocytes.To assess the level of leptin and resistin in non-obese multiple myeloma patients and to study their relation with Ig level and disease stage.32 subjects were included; 16 patients diagnosed with MM and 16 healthy individuals served as control. All were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, routine laboratory investigations and leptin & resistin blood level. Laboratory investigations were done for diagnosis and staging for MM patients.Leptin was significantly higher in MM patients compared with the control group, unlike resistin which showed no significant difference between the two groups. A significant positive relation was found between IgG level & leptin. Similarly, a significant difference in leptin level has been observed between stage I & stage II (higher in II).Leptin may play a role in the pathogenesis of MM and its level may be changed in different stages.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841155","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.709894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.698612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.697993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.668882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Leptin","weight":0.643186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.538165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.329404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Resistin","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistin"},{"name":"Medical laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
