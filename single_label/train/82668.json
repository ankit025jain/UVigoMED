{"id":82668,"title":"CAD/CAM implant abutments using coded healing abutments: a detailed description of the restorative process.","abstract":"Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) represents a leap forward in the fabrication of implant restorations. Coded healing abutments can be digitally read, and they eliminate the steps needed to make implant impressions using traditional impression copings. This article provides a detailed description of the restorative process using CAD/CAM technology and coded healing abutments.
