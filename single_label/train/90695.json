{"id":90695,"title":"Preparation of carboxymethyl cellulose sulfates and its application as anticoagulant and wound dressing.","abstract":"Tissue engineering is aiming to build an artificial environment or biological scaffold material that imitates the living environment of cells in the body. In this work, carboxymethyl cellulose sulfates were prepared by reacting carboxymethyl cellulose with N(SO3Na)3 which was synthesized by sodium bisulfite and sodium nitrite in aqueous solution. The reaction conditions affected the degree of substitution (DS) were measured by the barium sulfate nephelometry method. And the anticoagulant activity of carboxymethyl cellulose sulfates with different DS, concentration and molecular weights were investigated by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT) and prothrombin time (PT). In addition, the effect of carboxymethyl cellulose sulfates on wound healing had been evaluated by the rate of wound healing and the histological examinations. The results indicated that the introduction of sulfate groups into the carboxymethyl cellulose sulfates improved its anticoagulant activity, and the wound dressings treated with carboxymethyl cellulose sulfates obviously promoted wound healing.
