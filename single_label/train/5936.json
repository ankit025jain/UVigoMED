{"id":5936,"title":"Recovery of vascular function after exposure to a single bout of segmental vibration.","abstract":"Work rotation schedules may be used to reduce the negative effects of vibration on vascular function. This study determined how long it takes vascular function to recover after a single exposure to vibration in rats (125 Hz, acceleration 5 g). The responsiveness of rat-tail arteries to the vasoconstricting factor UK14304, an ?2C-adrenoreceptor agonist, and the vasodilating factor acetylcholine (ACh) were measured ex vivo 1, 2, 7, or 9 d after exposure to a single bout of vibration. Vasoconstriction induced by UK14304 returned to control levels after 1 d of recovery. However, re-dilation induced by ACh did not return to baseline until after 9 d of recovery. Exposure to vibration exerted prolonged effects on peripheral vascular function, and altered vascular responses to a subsequent exposure. To optimize the positive results of work rotation schedules, it is suggested that studies assessing recovery of vascular function after exposure to a single bout of vibration be performed in humans.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25072825","annotations":[{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.732203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.709053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.701566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.67551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.318411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.311544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.209769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Hertz","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.0934898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.0689601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Rattail","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattail"},{"name":"Ex vivo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_vivo"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Responsiveness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsiveness"},{"name":"Recovery (Eminem album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_(Eminem_album)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"}]}
