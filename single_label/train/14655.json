{"id":14655,"title":"Formononetin protects TBI rats against neurological lesions and the underlying mechanism.","abstract":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability or death worldwide, especially in the young. Thus, effective medication with few side effects needs to be developed. This work aimed to explore the potential benefits of formononetin (FN) on TBI rodent model and to discuss the regarding mechanism. These findings showed that FN effectively increased the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in brain tissue of TBI rats (P<0.01), while it reduced intracephalic malonaldehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations (P<0.01). Meanwhile, the hydrocephalus in the TBI rat was alleviated, and the injured nerve cell of the lesioned brain was reduced as showed in hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining assay. In addition, the endogenous mRNA level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the brain of the TBI rat was significantly down-regulated (P<0.01). Furthermore, the protein expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was effectively up-regulated (P<0.01). Taken together, we conclude that formononetin mediates the promising anti-TBI effects against neurocyte damage, which the underlying mechanisms are associated with inhibiting intracephalic inflammatory response and oxidative stress for neuroprotection.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Animal
