{"id":85074,"title":"Effect of yiqibushenhuoxue decoction on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease measured by St. George's respiratory disease questionnaire scores and forced expiratory volume.","abstract":"To investigate the effects of Yiqibushenhuoxue decoction on stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by observing its influences on patients' quality of life and airway inflammation.Seventy patients with stable COPD were randomly divided into a treatment group (n = 35) treated with Yiqibushenhuoxue decoction plus Seretide and a control group (n = 35) treated with Seretide only. The dosage of Yiqibushenhuoxue decoction was 100 mL each time, twice a day, and the dosage of Seretide was salmeterol 50 microg/fluticasone 250 microg twice a day. Both groups were treated for 12 weeks. Before and after the treatment, St George's respiratory disease questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, forced expiratory volume, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/ FVC) were measured.The SGRQ scores in both groups were significantly lower than those before treatment (P < 0.05). After treatment, the total SGRQ scores and each subscore in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The percentage of the predicted FEV1% and FEV1/FVC were higher in both groups, but no statistical differences were detected from before to after the treatment or between the two groups (P > 0.05).Yiqibushenhuoxue decoction could significantly decrease the SGRQ scores in patients with stable COPD, which suggests that it is able to improve patient symptoms.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25185362","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.807909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Vital capacity","weight":0.783491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_capacity"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Exhalation","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhalation"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.435845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Salmeterol","weight":0.311111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmeterol"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Recurrent airway obstruction","weight":0.153636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_airway_obstruction"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fluticasone/salmeterol","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluticasone/salmeterol"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
