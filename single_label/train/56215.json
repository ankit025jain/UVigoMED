{"id":56215,"title":"Phenotypic heterogeneity of corneal endothelium in iridocorneal endothelial syndrome by in vivo confocal microscopy.","abstract":"To present a case of iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome showing phenotypic heterogeneity of endothelial morphology between the 2 eyes of a patient as visualized by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM).Confocal microscopy using the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT)-3 with Rostock Cornea Module was performed bilaterally during routine follow-up on a 60-year-old lady being managed as a case of ICE syndrome with secondary glaucoma in the right eye.IVCM revealed endothelial changes in both eyes, which however varied in morphology. Endothelium of the right eye showed a \"total ICE\" pattern with \"ICE-type of cells,\" that is, diffuse involvement with enlarged, pleomorphic \"epithelioid\" cells having hyper-reflective nuclei and no intervening areas of the normal endothelium. The left endothelium had broad areas of normal hexagonal endothelial mosaic interspersed with different types of ICE cells showing nipple-shaped evaginations, light dark reversal and central craters with hyper-reflective rims.This report with the help of IVCM demonstrates that though ICE syndrome is a clinical entity which classically has been considered predominantly unilateral, the endothelial changes can be bilateral and heterogeneous. The apparent heterogeneity in the present case may represent 2 different stages of the disease process at the level of the corneal endothelium-advanced disease OD and presymptomatic disease OS.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727634","annotations":[{"name":"Confocal microscopy","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscopy"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.818875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.800133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.684639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.63229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.478888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.397819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.393917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.369643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.316728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.139838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)"},{"name":"Heidelberg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg"},{"name":"Mosaic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic"},{"name":"Rostock","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostock"},{"name":"Corneal endothelium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_endothelium"},{"name":"Impact crater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Hexagon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Optometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optometry"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Rim (wheel)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rim_(wheel)"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Intercity-Express","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity-Express"},{"name":"Epithelioid cell","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelioid_cell"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"}]}
