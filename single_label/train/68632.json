{"id":68632,"title":"Alemtuzumab and minimization immunotherapy in kidney transplantation: long-term results of comparison with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin and standard triple maintenance therapy.","abstract":"Efforts to improve long-term patient and allograft survival have included use of induction therapies as well as steroid and/or calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) avoidance/minimization.This is a retrospective review of kidney transplant recipients between September 2004 and July 2009. Immune minimization (group 1; n = 182) received alemtuzumab induction, low-dose CNI, and mycophenolic acid (MPA). Conventional immunosuppression (group 2; n = 232) received rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin, standard-dose CNI, MPA, and prednisone.Both groups were followed up for same length of time (49.4 Â± 21.7 months; P = .12). Patient survival was also similar (90% vs 94%; P = .14). Death-censored graft survival was inferior in group 1 compared with group 2 (86% vs 96%, respectively; P = .003). On multivariate analysis, group 1 was an independent risk factor for graft loss (aHR = 2.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-5.26; P = .006). Biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred more in group 1, due to late rejections compared with group 2 (7% vs 2%; P < .01 respectively). Graft function was lower in group 1 compared with group 2 at 3 months (49.5 mL/mt vs 70.7 mL/mt, respectively; P < .001) to 48 months (48.6 mL/mt vs 69.4 mL/mt, respectively; P = .04).Minimization of maintenance immunosuppression after alemtuzumab correlated with higher acute rejection and inferior graft survival compared with thymoglobulin and conventional triple immunotherapy.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507032","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Mycophenolic acid","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycophenolic_acid"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Calcineurin","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.804973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.766125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.759391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.755037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.712172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.432482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.358867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alemtuzumab","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alemtuzumab"},{"name":"Calcineurin inhibitor","weight":0.256011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin_inhibitor"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"325","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/325"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Inferior vena cava","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Opioid replacement therapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_replacement_therapy"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Minimisation (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimisation_(psychology)"}]}
