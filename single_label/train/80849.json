{"id":80849,"title":"Detection of Gnathostoma spinigerum antibodies in sera of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage patients in Thailand.","abstract":"Gnathostoma spinigerum can cause subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The detection of specific antibodies in serum against G. spinigerum antigen is helpful for diagnosis of neurognathostomiasis. There is limited data on the frequency of G. spinigerum infection in non-traumatic SAH. A series of patients diagnosed as non-traumatic SAH at the Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Thailand between January 2011 and January 2013 were studied. CT or MR imaging of the brain was used for diagnosis of SAH. Patients were categorized as aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (A-SAH) or non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (NA-SAH) according to the results of cerebral angiograms. The presence of specific antibodies in serum against 21- or 24-kDa G. spinigerum antigen was determined using the immunoblot technique. The detection rate of antibodies was compared between the 2 groups. Of the 118 non-traumatic SAH patients for whom cerebral angiogram and immunoblot data were available, 80 (67.8%) patients had A-SAH, whereas 38 (32.2%) had NA-SAH. Overall, 23.7% were positive for specific antibodies against 21- and/or 24-kDa G. spinigerum antigen. No significant differences were found in the positive rate of specific antibodies against G. spinigerum in both groups (P-value=0.350).
