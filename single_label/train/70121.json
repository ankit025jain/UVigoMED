{"id":70121,"title":"Structural basis for the inefficient nucleotide incorporation opposite cisplatin-DNA lesion by human DNA polymerase ?.","abstract":"Human DNA polymerase ? (pol?) has been suggested to play a role in cisplatin resistance, especially in pol?-overexpressing cancer cells. Pol? has been shown to accurately albeit slowly bypass the cisplatin-1,2-d(GpG) (Pt-GG) intramolecular cross-link in vitro. Currently, the structural basis for the inefficient Pt-GG bypass mechanism of pol? is unknown. To gain structural insights into the mechanism, we determined two ternary structures of pol? incorporating dCTP opposite the templating Pt-GG lesion in the presence of the active site Mg(2+) or Mn(2+). The Mg(2+)-bound structure shows that the bulky Pt-GG adduct is accommodated in the pol? active site without any steric hindrance. In addition, both guanines of the Pt-GG lesion form Watson-Crick base pairing with the primer terminus dC and the incoming dCTP, providing the structural basis for the accurate bypass of the Pt-GG adduct by pol?. The Mn(2+)-bound structure shows that pol? adopts a catalytically suboptimal semiclosed conformation during the insertion of dCTP opposite the templating Pt-GG, explaining the inefficient replication across the Pt-GG lesion by pol?. Overall, our studies provide the first structural insights into the mechanism of the potential pol?-mediated cisplatin resistance.
