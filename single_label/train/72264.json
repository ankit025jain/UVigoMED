{"id":72264,"title":"The best candidates for nerve-sparing stripping surgery for facial nerve schwannoma.","abstract":"Clinical decision making for facial nerve schwannoma is particularly complicated in patients with good facial nerve function; however, an early nerve-sparing tumor resection stripping technique minimizes facial deficits associated with treatment. The present study characterized the optimal candidate for this nerve-sparing surgical strategy in patients with good facial function.Retrospective study.Nerve-sparing stripping surgery was performed on 28 patients with facial nerve schwannoma. The House-Brackmann grading system was used to assess pre- and postoperative facial function. We retrospectively analyzed pre- and postoperative facial function, duration of facial palsy, tumor size, and location and number of involved segments. The data were analyzed using Fisher exact test and independent t tests.Of the 28 patients, 18 successfully underwent stripping surgery and 16 had a favorable outcome. Favorable postoperative facial function was associated with good preoperative facial function (House-Brackmann grade [HBG] ?II); small, localized tumors; and tumors located in the geniculate ganglion and/or its proximal portion.Patients with facial nerve schwannoma who have good preoperative facial function (HBG ?2), tumor located in the proximal portion of the geniculate ganglion, and small tumors (<2 cm) involving one or two facial nerve segments can be the best candidates for nerve-sparing stripping surgery.4","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984859","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.627589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Schwannoma","weight":0.498516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwannoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.466486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.41446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.355084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.268808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.111458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Geniculate ganglion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geniculate_ganglion"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Ronald Fisher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"HBG (time signal)","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBG_(time_signal)"},{"name":"Balance of trade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Striptease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striptease"},{"name":"Internationalization and localization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
