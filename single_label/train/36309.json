{"id":36309,"title":"Progressive muscular dystrophy of heart: diagnosis easily missed by clinicians.","abstract":"Muscular dystrophy connotes a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive wasting and weakness of the skeletal muscles. In several forms of muscular dystrophy, cardiac dysfunction occurs, and cardiac disease may even be the predominant manifestation of the underlying genetic myopathy. We present a case of progressive muscular dystrophy of the heart in which the initial and only manifestation was sudden death in a young man.
