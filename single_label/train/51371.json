{"id":51371,"title":"Lessons from whole-exome sequencing in MODYX families.","abstract":"We report the first results from whole-exome sequencing performed in families with Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young without a known genetic cause of diabetes (MODYX). This next generation sequencing technique pointed out that routine testing of MODY needs constant awareness and regular re-evaluation of both clinical criteria and primer sequences.
