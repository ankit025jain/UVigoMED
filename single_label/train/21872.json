{"id":21872,"title":"Antibiotic prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","abstract":"We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients.We collected reports from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science, along with references cited therein. We included prospective, randomized studies on systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in HSCT recipients.Seventeen trials with 1453 autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients were included. Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with placebo or no prophylaxis in 10 trials and with non-absorbable antibiotics in two trials. Systemic antibiotics other than fluoroquinolones were evaluated in five of these 12 trials. Four trials evaluated the effect of the addition of antibiotics for gram-positive bacteria to fluoroquinolones. One trial compared two different systemic antibiotic regimens: fluoroquinolones versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. As a result, systemic antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of febrile episodes (OR 0.16; 95%CI 0.09-0.30), clinically or microbiologically documented infection (OR 0.38; 95%CI 0.22-0.63) and bacteremia (OR 0.31; 95%CI 0.16-0.59) without significantly affecting all-cause mortality or infection-related mortality.Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis successfully reduced the incidence of infection. However, there was no significant impact on mortality. The clinical benefits of prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones were inconclusive because of the small number of clinical trials evaluated.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583063","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.93629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.805662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.769027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.72338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Quinolone","weight":0.715145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.66159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.65096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.647165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.199442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Web of Science","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"}]}
