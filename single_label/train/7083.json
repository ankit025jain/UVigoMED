{"id":7083,"title":"A nuclear transport inhibitor that modulates the unfolded protein response and provides in vivo protection against lethal dengue virus infection.","abstract":"Dengue virus (DENV) is estimated to cause 390 million infections each year, but there is no licensed vaccine or therapeutic currently available.We describe a novel, high-throughput screen to identify compounds inhibiting the interaction between DENV nonstructural protein 5 and host nuclear transport proteins. We document the antiviral properties of a lead compound against all 4 serotypes of DENV, antibody-dependent enhanced (ADE) infection, and ex vivo and in vivo DENV infections. In addition, we use quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to examine cellular effects upon compound addition.We identify N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR) as effective in protecting against DENV-1-4 and DENV-1 ADE infections, with 50% effective concentrations in the low micromolar range. 4-HPR but not the closely related N-(4-methoxyphenyl) retinamide (4-MPR) could reduce viral RNA levels and titers when applied to an established infection. 4-HPR but not 4-MPR was found to specifically upregulate the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase arm of the unfolded protein response. Strikingly, 4-HPR but not 4-MPR restricted infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in a lethal ADE-infection mouse model.4-HPR is a novel antiviral that modulates the unfolded protein response, effective against DENV1-4 at concentrations achievable in the plasma in a clinical setting, and provides protection in a lethal mouse model.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Animal
