{"id":36522,"title":"Combined approach in ventricular septal defect and adult pulmonary hypertension.","abstract":"Early closure of a large ventricular septal defect before the onset of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is important. Pulmonary hypertensive events might cause significant morbidity or mortality, even when closure is performed after infancy. Therefore, treatment of pulmonary hypertension after surgery may be the most important issue affecting the prognosis. We describe successful treatment of pulmonary hypertension in a 25-year-old woman after closure of large ventricular septal defect, with inhaled nitric oxide, sildenafil, and bosentan.
