{"id":84489,"title":"[Effect of ethanol extract from Saussurea involucrata on biochemical indicators of simulated high-altitude hypoxia induced mice].","abstract":"To estimate the effect of ethanol extract from Saussurea involucrata (EES) on biochemical indicators of simulated high-altitude hypoxia induced mice and its mechanism.The oxidative stress indicator( MDA content, SOD activity) and metabolism parameters (LD content, LDH activity, ATP content, Na+ -K+ -ATPase and Ca2+ -Mg2+ -ATPase activity) in both brain and heart of the simulated high-altitude hypoxia induced mice were detected.Compared with the model group, the ESS group could significantly increase the activity of SOD and LDH and decrease the content of MDA and LD in both brain and heart, the content of ATP and the activity of Na+ -K -ATPase and Ca2+ -Mg2+ -ATPase were also elevated.The results demonstrate that EES can increase the antioxidant ability, decrease the injury of free radical and ease the disfunction of energy metabolism caused by hypoxia.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090715","annotations":[{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.928167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Adenosine triphosphate","weight":0.805162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Bioenergetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergetics"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"ATPase","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATPase"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.550955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Kelvin","weight":0.309423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.285295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Median lethal dose","weight":0.20868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.198394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0289708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"}]}
