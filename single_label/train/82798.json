{"id":82798,"title":"[Effect of yangyin yiqi huoxue recipe on immune balance of Th1/Th2 in serum and submaxillary glands of NOD mice with Sjogren's syndrome].","abstract":"To observe the effect of Yangyin Yiqi Huoxue Recipe (YYHR) on expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and immune balance of Th1/Th2 in serum and submaxillary glands of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with Sjogren's syndrome (SS), and to explore its mechanisms.Totally 32 NOD mice were randomly into 4 groups, i.e., the model group, the Chinese medicine group [CM, administered with YYHR at the dose of 0.4 mL by gavage (100 g/kg)], the Western medicine group [WM group, administered with hydroxychloroquine 0.4 mL by gavage (60 mg/kg)], and the combined group [administered with YYHR (50 g/kg) and hydroxychloroquine (60 mg/kg) 0.4 mL by gavage], 8 mice in each group. Eight Balb/C mice were recruited as the normal control group. Mice were sacrificed to withdraw blood after 8 weeks. The submaxillary gland was excised. Serum levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 were detected by ELISA. Protein expression of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 in submaxillary glands was detected by SP method.Compared with the normal group, levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 in serum and submaxillary glands all increased in the model group (P < 0.05). Levels of IFN-gamma and IL-10 in serum in the CM group and the combined group were lower than those of the WM group (P < 0.05). Serum levels of IFN-gamma and IL-2 in submaxillary glands in combined group were lower than those of the WM group (P < 0.05). The ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-4 in serum and submaxillary glands in the model group were higher than that of the rest groups (P < 0.05). Besides, it was the nearest to that of the normal group.YYHR could decrease the levels of Th1 and Th2 related cytokines and the ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-4 in serum and submaxillary glands of NOD mice with SS. It could achieve therapeutic effects through adjusting immune balance of Th1/Th2 in SS mice.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517064","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.904628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.829017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Hydroxychloroquine","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxychloroquine"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.657951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.647956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.59418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.495506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.473927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.263164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"China","weight":0.214197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.198058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.112383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"NOD mice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOD_mice"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Recipe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recipe"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
