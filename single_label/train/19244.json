{"id":19244,"title":"Anti-diphtheria immunity in Nigerian mothers and their newborns.","abstract":"Immunity to diphtheria has been noted to wane with age such that previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of females with characteristics comparable to those of Nigerian women of reproductive age have inadequate levels of immunity to diphtheria. Thus, it is envisaged that Nigerian newborns may inherit inadequate levels of immunity to diphtheria from their mothers.Cord blood and peripheral maternal blood samples were collected from 231 mother-infant pairs at delivery. Anti-diphtheria antibody titres were assayed using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Recruited babies were those born at term with normal birth weight.As much as 29.9% of both mothers and their babies had no protection (antibody titre<0.01 IU/ml) from diphtheria. Ninety (39.0% CI 33%,45%) mothers and 107 (46.3% CI 40%,52%) babies were inadequately protected (antibody titre<0.1 IU/ml) from diphtheria. The difference in the geometric mean antibody titres of mothers and babies was statistically significant (p<0.0001). There was a strong positive linear correlation between maternal and newborn antibody titres (\"r\"=0.983, p<0.0001), such that, as mothers antibody titres increased those of their babies also increased.Significant proportions of Nigerian mothers and newborns are at risk of developing diphtheria. Vaccination of parturient women with booster doses of diphtheria toxoid vaccine is recommended.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731812","annotations":[{"name":"Diphtheria","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.817307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.718674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.690515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.609204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.604945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.47817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.403582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.35839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.329395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.261966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.192811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Birth mass","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_mass"},{"name":"Geometry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"},{"name":"Geometric mean","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean"},{"name":"Cord blood","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_blood"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"983","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/983"},{"name":"Cord Automobile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord_Automobile"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Booster dose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Toxoid","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoid"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Metallurgical assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_assay"},{"name":"List of highest playoff series scoring averages in National Basketball Association history","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_playoff_series_scoring_averages_in_National_Basketball_Association_history"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
