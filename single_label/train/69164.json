{"id":69164,"title":"miR-20a promotes prostate cancer invasion and migration through targeting ABL2.","abstract":"The aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been found in various types of cancer. The present study found miR-20a was significantly up-regulated in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate tissues. Patients with a higher miR-20a expression had a Gleason score of 7-10 and shorter survival time. The transwell and wound healing assays revealed that blocking expression of miR-20a by miR-20a ASO suppresses the invasion and migration of PC-3 and DU145 cells in vitro and also inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we identified miR-20a directly targets the ABL family non-receptor tyrosine kinases ABL2 and negatively regulates the phosphorylation of its downstream gene p190RhoGAP. Knockdown of ABL2 promoted cell invasion and migration and we identified miR-20a-induced cell invasion and migration can be rescued by ABL2. In conclusion, our findings show that miR-20a significantly contributes to the progression of prostate cancer by targeting ABL2.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464651","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.736389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.661137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.62656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.558272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.453327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.357152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"DU145","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DU145"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"ABL2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABL2"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"Abl gene","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abl_gene"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"710","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/710"},{"name":"Duke University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Amaury Sport Organisation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaury_Sport_Organisation"},{"name":"Negative regulation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_regulation"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"RhoGAP domain","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RhoGAP_domain"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
