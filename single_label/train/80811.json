{"id":80811,"title":"?? T cells and CD14+ monocytes are predominant cellular sources of cytokines and chemokines associated with severe malaria.","abstract":"Severe malaria (SM) is associated with high levels of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The role of chemokines is less clear, as is their cellular source.In a case-control study of children with SM (n = 200), uncomplicated malaria (UM) (n = 153) and healthy community controls (HC) (n = 162) in Papua, New Guinea, we measured cytokine/chemokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with live Plasmodium falciparum parasitized red blood cells (pRBC). Cellular sources were determined. Associations between immunological endpoints and clinical/parasitological variables were tested.Compared to HC and UM, children with SM produced significantly higher IL-10, IP-10, MIP-1?m and MCP-2. TNF and MIP-1? were significantly higher in the SM compared to the UM group. IL-10, IL-6, MIP-1?, MIP-1?, and MCP-2 were associated with increased odds of SM. SM syndromes were associated with distinct cytokine/chemokine response profiles compared to UM cases. TNF, MIP-1?, and MIP-1? were produced predominantly by monocytes and ?? T cells, and IL-10 by CD4(+) T cells.Early/innate PBMC responses to pRBC in vitro are informative as to cytokines/chemokines associated with SM. Predominant cellular sources are monocytes and ?? T cells. Monocyte-derived chemokines support a role for monocyte infiltrates in the etiology of SM.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523513","annotations":[{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.872009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.869772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"CD14","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD14"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.739616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.725822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.674419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell","weight":0.669041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cell"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.288635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.220694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"New Guinea","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea"},{"name":"Papua New Guinea","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"University of Michigan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Metacarpophalangeal joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpophalangeal_joint"},{"name":"Macrophage inflammatory protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage_inflammatory_protein"},{"name":"Guinea","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"}]}
