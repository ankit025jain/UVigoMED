{"id":20527,"title":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Southern Coastal Region of China, 2007-2012.","abstract":"We analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of Vibrio parahaemolyticus among patients with acute infectious diarrhea in the southern coastal region of China. V. parahaemolyticus was the leading cause of bacterial infectious diarrhea in this region during 2007-2012. Serotype O3:K6 strains were most common, followed by serotypes O4:K8 and O3:K29.
