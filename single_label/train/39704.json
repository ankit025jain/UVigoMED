{"id":39704,"title":"Predictive value of computerized morphometric analysis of steatosis in donor livers.","abstract":"To describe, by computerized morphometry, the degree and the type of steatosis in liver transplants that developed primary nonfunction and to compare the results with the quantification by pathologist.Twelve patients who developed primary nonfunction after liver transplantation were matched with 23 transplanted patients with a regular postoperative clinical course. Morphology of the liver biopsy included many stereological parameters; all cases were evaluated by an operator blinded to the diagnosis and to the clinical history. The assessment of steatosis by morphometry was compared with the pathologist's evaluation. Moreover, to assess the reproducibility of the morphometric model, another operator applied the morphometric model in a blinded fashion to a randomly selected sample of cases.The percentage of hepatocytes with microsteatosis and the ratio of macro/microsteatosis were higher in primary nonfunction. The pathologist's evaluation of steatosis showed a marked overestimation when compared to morphometry. Lastly, the comparison between the results of 2 blinded operators of morphometric analysis showed a high reproducibility with a low interobserver variability.Our quantitative estimation of the degree and the quality of steatosis avoids interobserver interpretations. Moreover, our analysis shows that the quantification of steatosis in liver transplantation by the current assessment must be reviewed in order to reevaluate the real impact of steatosis.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141490","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.822167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.810683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.755785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.710736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.708893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.575309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.282584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.221274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Quantification","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.0513546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Morphometrics","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphometrics"},{"name":"Stereology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereology"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
