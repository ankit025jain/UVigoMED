{"id":81177,"title":"Schizontemia as an indicator of severe malaria.","abstract":"We conducted this study to determine if the finding of schizontemia could be used as an indicator of severe falciparum malaria. We enrolled 250 patients with severe falciparum malaria and 250 patients with umcomplicated falciparum malaria into the study. Severe falciparum malaria was defined following World Health Organization criteria (2010). Of the 250 patients with severe falciparum malaria, 99 (39.6%) had schizontemia on admission. Of the 250 patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, 0 (0%) had schizontemia (p<0.05). Schizontemia was also found to be significantly correlated with parasite density, severe malaria, impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hemoglobinuria (p<0.05). Schizontemia may be considered as an indicator of severe malaria.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437308","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.777841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.453979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.408948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.153765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.106702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Hemoglobinuria","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobinuria"},{"name":"PH indicator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"}]}
