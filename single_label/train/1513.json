{"id":1513,"title":"Exploratory comparative study on the diffusion of synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones.","abstract":"The use of synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones in southeastern Michigan was explored using Roger's Diffusion of Innovation theory. A mixed methods approach after specific synthetic cannabinoids and cathinone compounds were scheduled was used that included analysis of treatment admissions for two years, surveys of 15 substance abuse treatment providers, and qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of 24 participants. The participant system norm supported trying new drugs, and both drugs were confirmed to have been easier to access than traditional drugs. The participants had negative views of synthetic cathinones due to one sensational news story without counterbalancing positive experiences in their social environment. Although synthetic cannabinoids were also linked to a sensational news story, it was counterbalanced by positive personal experiences. These differences contributed to greater use of synthetic cannabinoids compared to synthetic cathinones as evidenced by admissions, providers' reports, and participants' reports. All participants expressed a preference for traditional drugs, indicating that novel drugs had no relative advantage over other drugs of abuse. Diffusion of Innovation theory can provide a framework for understanding the differential use of novel drugs.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25364986","annotations":[{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.464913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.444062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.343034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.341381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.341325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.221662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Social environment","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_environment"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.118291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Cannabinoid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid"},{"name":"Nonprobability sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprobability_sampling"},{"name":"Cathinone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathinone"},{"name":"News","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Comparative religion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_religion"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Sensationalism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensationalism"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Article (publishing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(publishing)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Purpose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose"},{"name":"Counterweight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterweight"},{"name":"Multiracial","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial"},{"name":"Comparative linguistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_linguistics"},{"name":"Southeast Michigan","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Michigan"}]}
