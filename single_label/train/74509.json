{"id":74509,"title":"[Clinical research of primary trigeminal neuralgia treated with electroacupuncture at qi streets acupoints combined with spinal regulation therapy].","abstract":"To compare the difference in the clinical efficacy on primary trigeminal neuralgia (PTN) between the comprehensive therapy of electroacupuncture (EA) at qi streets acupoints combined with spinal regulation method and medication with carbamazepine (CBZ).Sixty patients were randomized into a comprehensive therapy group (30 cases) and a medication group (30 cases). In the comprehensive therapy group, the acupoints at qi streets on the head such as Taiyang (EX-HN 5) and Sishencong (EX-HN 1) and those at qi streets on the chest and abdomen such as Shenshu (BL 23), Zhongwan (CV 12) and Guanyuan (CV 4), etc. were selected. After arrival of qi, EA was attached on 2 to 4 groups of acupoints. After acupuncture, the spinal regulation method was applied. This comprehensive therapy was given once a day. In the medication group, CBZ was used for oral administration, 100 mg at the first time, twice a day, and 400 to 600 mg each day as the maintenance dose. Separately, before and after treatment, in 2 and 6 months in follow-up, pain rating index (PRI), life satisfaction index B (LSI-B) and hamilton depression scale (HAMD) were adopted to evaluate comprehensively the clinical efficacy in the two groups and compare the adverse reaction during the treatment between the two groups.After treatment, the curative and markedly effective rate in the comprehensive therapy group was 76.7% (23/30), which was better than 63.3% (19/30) in the medication group (P < 0.01). The difference in PRI was not significant after treatment between the two groups (all P > 0.05). In 2 and 6 months follow-up, PRI grade in the comprehensive therapy group was superior to that of the medication group (both P<0. 05). After treatment and in follow-up, HAMD score was all reduced in the two groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05) and the result in follow-up in the comprehensive therapy group was significant as compared with that in the medication group (all P<0. 05). After treatment, LSI-B score was increased obviously in the two groups (all P < 0.05) and the result in the comprehensive therapy group was better than that in the medication group (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reaction in the comprehensive therapy group was 16.7% (5/30), which was lower than 30.0% (9/30, P < 0.01) in the medication group.The comprehensive therapy of EA at qi streets acpoints combined with spinal regulation method achieves the long-term efficacy on PTN as compared with oral administration of CBZ in terms of the improvement of psychological condition, analgesia and life quality. It is the safe, effective and stable therapy.","date":"2014-10-22","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25335251","annotations":[{"name":"Carbamazepine","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.801147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Neuralgia","weight":0.733984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Trigeminal nerve","weight":0.694838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_nerve"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.673055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.665427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.519367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.417882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.354795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Trigeminal neuralgia","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_neuralgia"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.218084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.214117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.102966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Group psychotherapy","weight":0.0548502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_psychotherapy"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Oral administration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_administration"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Maintenance, repair, and operations","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance,_repair,_and_operations"},{"name":"Stable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
