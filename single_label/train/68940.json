{"id":68940,"title":"[Renin-angiotensin system and urological cancers].","abstract":"A controversy animates the literature on the potential role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in tumorogenesis. The objective of this review was to determine the involvement of this pathway in cancer, and more specifically in urological cancers.We made a systematic review of articles referenced in Pubmed, using the following keywords alone or combined: cancer, renin, angiotensin, VEGF, AT1R, antagonists of angiotensin-2 receptors, inhibitors of angiotensinogen converting.Many types of cancers overexpress AT1-R in their tumoral tissues (breast, stomach, bladder, astrocytoma, glioblastoma, ovary, uterus, pancreas, kidney, prostate, adrenal gland). Ang-II can induce VEGF-A expression and promote neoangiogenesis, but also can trigger different molecular pathways involved in cell proliferation or inhibit apoptosis. Several xenograft murin models demonstrated anti-tumoral efficacy of RAS blockers, alone or using combined therapies, targeting angiogenesis and slowing down tumor growth. Retrospective studies in patients have also revealed a better progression-free survival and a better response to therapies in those treated with RAS blockers.Many data seem to demonstrate the involvement of the RAS in carcinogenesis, as well as anti-tumoral effect of RAS blockers in addition to anti-cancer treatments. Clinical data are now expected to confirm these experimental findings.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485075","annotations":[{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.864258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.85772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Astrocytoma","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocytoma"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Renin","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.794493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.784752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.75744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.437478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.391938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.344321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.281513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.146849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Overexpress","weight":0.0385503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overexpress"},{"name":"Ataxia telangiectasia","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Angiotensinogen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensinogen"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor_A"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"}]}
