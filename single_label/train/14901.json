{"id":14901,"title":"Ventralight ST and SorbaFix versus Physiomesh and Securestrap in a porcine model.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to compare mesh contracture, adhesion characteristics, tissue ingrowth, and histologic response of Ventralight ST/SorbaFix (C.R. Bard/Davol, Warwick, RI, USA) with Physiomesh/Securestrap (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) in a porcine model of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.Standard laparoscopic technique was used to bilaterally implant meshes in 10 female Yorkshire swine. Each animal received either two Ventralight ST meshes (oval shaped, 10.2 × 15.2 cm) or two Physiomesh meshes (oval shaped 10 × 15 cm), one on either side of the midline. The meshes were fixated to the intact peritoneum with either SorbaFix (for animals receiving Ventralight ST) or Securestrap (for animals receiving Physiomesh). There were 5 animals in each group, yielding 10 of each meshfixation combination. Mesh contracture, adhesion characteristics, tissue ingrowth, and histologic response were evaluated after 14 days by image analysis, mechanical testing, and histologic staining (hematoxylin-eosin, Masson trichrome, picrosirius red, and von Willebrand factor).Ventralight ST/SorbaFix and Physiomesh/Securestrap exhibited a similar percentage of mesh contracture, percentage of adhesion coverage, adhesion tenacity, collagen deposition, and levels of necrosis (P > .05 in all cases). However, Ventralight ST/SorbaFix exhibited significantly less inflammation (P = .0001), fibrosis (P = .0017), hemorrhage (P = .0001), and angiogenesis (P = .0032) and significantly greater strength of tissue ingrowth (P = .0003) than Physiomesh/Securestrap after the 14-day implantation period.Ventralight ST/SorbaFix exhibited more favorable strength of tissue ingrowth and histologic response and similar mesh contracture and adhesion characteristics compared with Physiomesh/Securestrap over a short-term 14-day implantation period in a preclinical porcine model.","date":"2014-01-08","categories":"Animal
