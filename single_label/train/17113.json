{"id":17113,"title":"The relationship between serum bilirubin level with interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and mortality scores in patients with sepsis.","abstract":"Bilirubin has been shown to influence the mechanisms of both apoptosis and inflammation.The aim of the following study is to investigate the relationship between the serum bilirubin level with sepsis progression.A total of 20 patients from intensive care unit were included for this study.Patients were divided into two groups: Patients diagnosed with sepsis according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Clinical Care Medicine consensus conference criteria (n0 = 10) and patients treated for various other diagnoses ( n = 10). Blood samples were collected for both groups at the time of origin (defined as the time of diagnosis) and 24 and 48 h after diagnosis. Serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and bilirubin levels were analyzed and compared. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II and sepsis related organ failure (SOFA) scores of the patients were also evaluated.We used Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, version 17.0, SPSS Inc. 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago) for statistical analysis.At all-time intervals, serum IL-6, IL-10 and total, direct and indirect serum bilirubin levels were significantly higher in the sepsis group ( P < 0.05); APACHE II and SOFA scores were also significantly higher. Both SOFA scores and serum IL-10 levels were positively correlated with bilirubin levels 24 h after diagnosis (P < 0.05, r = -0.76).Although levels of bilirubin and other associated parameters were higher for the sepsis group, only SOFA score and bilirubin levels were correlated. Because bilirubin is already a SOFA parameter, this correlation was not considered as clinically significant.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909480","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.743817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.695826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.613322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.60838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.605748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.469715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.466471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.355173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.341565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.338135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"APACHE II","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APACHE_II"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.273369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.14161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Chicago","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Organ failure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_failure"},{"name":"Microsoft Windows","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
