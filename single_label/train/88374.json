{"id":88374,"title":"The MetaHUS(®) fixation system versus pinning and plating in 5th metacarpal neck fractures.","abstract":"The treatment of fifth metacarpal neck fractures is controversial. The aim of this work was to modify the intermetacarpal pinning technique with an external connector, and to compare the results of this modified technique to those of intramedullary pinning and locking plate techniques. Our series included 56 extra-articular fractures of the neck of the fifth metacarpal treated by intramedullary pinning (group A), locking plate Aptus(®) MEDARTIS™ (group B) and MetaHUS(®) Arex™ (group C); the last one consisted in intermetacarpal percutaneous pinning and connecting the pins externally. There were no statistically significant differences for all criteria except active mobility, which was less important for group B. In groups A and B, 6 complications were noted, in group C, one. Our results showed that blocked intermetacarpal K-wires is a technique of choice for the treatment of displaced fifth metacarpal neck fractures, not only because it is easy to assemble and to remove, but also because it allows immediate active mobilization.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857636","annotations":[{"name":"Metacarpus","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpus"},{"name":"Intermetacarpal articulations","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermetacarpal_articulations"},{"name":"Fifth metacarpal bone","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_metacarpal_bone"},{"name":"AREX","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AREX"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Electrical connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_connector"},{"name":"Mobilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Pin (professional wrestling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(professional_wrestling)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"}]}
