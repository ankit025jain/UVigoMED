{"id":13384,"title":"Construction of an infectious cDNA clone of a swine genotype 3 HEV strain isolated in Shanghai, China.","abstract":"Infectious cDNA clones are important tools for studying molecular mechanisms in RNA viruses. The aim of this study was to construct an infectious cDNA clone for SAAS-JDY5, which is a genotype 3 HEV strain of swine origin.Construction employed overlapping PCR and restriction analysis to ligate nine cDNA fragments into a full-length cDNA clone containing 14 mutations compared to the consensus HEV genome sequence. Megaprimer PCR-directed mutagenesis restored nine non-silent mutations back to the consensus sequence while the other five silent mutations were maintained as genetic markers.HEV proteins were identified by an immuno?uorescence assay in Huh7 cells infected with capped RNA transcripts of the full-length cDNA clone, while HEV viremia, fecal HEV RNA and seroconversion were recorded in inoculated Sprague-Dawley rats.Our data confirmed the successful construction of an infectious cDNA clone of swine HEV strain pGEM4z-SAAS-JDY5, and support the use of rats as an HEV infectious model.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480875","annotations":[{"name":"Complementary DNA","weight":0.817098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.813027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Restriction digest","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_digest"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Consensus sequence","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_sequence"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Silent mutation","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_mutation"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.735604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Viremia","weight":0.728807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viremia"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mutagenesis","weight":0.701868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.683517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.665477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.445974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"China","weight":0.373053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.304175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0387277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Shanghai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Scientific consensus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"}]}
