{"id":92582,"title":"Are pedicle screw perforation rates influenced by registered or unregistered vertebrae in multilevel registration using a CT-based navigation system in the setting of scoliosis?","abstract":"We developed a new multilevel registration technique for pedicle screw (PS) insertion that has the capability of registering three consecutive vertebrae simultaneously, using a reference frame set to one of the caudal vertebrae. PSs are inserted in the consecutive and adjacent one or two vertebrae. This study aimed to investigate the perforation rates of the registered and unregistered adjacent vertebrae and compare the perforation rate of the PS and insertion time per PS between the conventional and new techniques.Sixty-nine consecutive scoliosis patients who underwent PS insertion using multilevel registration were enrolled. The conventional and new techniques were used in 29 subjects, and in 40 subjects, respectively. The total numbers of PSs used were 375 and 492, respectively. Of the 492 PSs, 301 were inserted to the registered vertebrae and 191 were inserted to the unregistered adjacent vertebrae. The PS malposition on postoperative axial computed tomography was classified as grades 2 and 3 perforation, using the Rao classification. The perforation rate and insertion time per PS were compared between the conventional and new techniques.The perforation rates did not significantly differ between the registered and unregistered vertebrae (10.3 vs. 6.3 %,), and between the new and conventional techniques (8.7 vs. 9.6 %). The insertion time per PS was significantly shorter in the new technique than in the conventional technique (3.9 ± 1.0 vs. 4.9 ± 1.3 min; p < 0.001).The new technique may be less invasive and decrease operative time without compromising the accuracy of PS placement.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108622","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.169444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"Pedicle of vertebral arch","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicle_of_vertebral_arch"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"Global Positioning System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"375","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/375"},{"name":"Mac OS X Panther","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Panther"},{"name":"Envelope detector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_detector"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Caudal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudal"},{"name":"Caudal vertebrae","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudal_vertebrae"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Special relativity","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity"}]}
