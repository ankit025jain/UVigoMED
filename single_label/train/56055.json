Thirty-eight eyes of 38 patients underwent SMILE and 33 eyes of 33 patients underwent femto-LASIK. Corneal sensation was tested with Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometry in five corneal areas preoperatively and at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Comparison of corneal sensation was performed for the SMILE and femto-LASIK groups. Additionally, the correlations were evaluated between the postoperative corneal sensation, preoperative spherical equivalent, and ablation depth.All tested areas within the cap or flap demonstrated corneal hypoesthesia immediately after both surgeries. SMILE-treated eyes showed less compromised corneal sensation than femto-LASIK-treated eyes at all postoperative visits in the central, inferior, nasal, and temporal areas at the 1-week and 1-month visits. In the SMILE group, the inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants recovered faster than other areas. In the femto-LASIK group, the sensation over the flap did not recover to preoperative levels by postoperative 6 months. There was no correlation between postoperative corneal sensation, preoperative spherical equivalent, and ablation depth in both groups.The impairment of corneal sensation was less significant in the SMILE group than in the femto-LASIK group and was independent of preoperative spherical equivalent or ablation depth.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763474","annotations":[{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.590493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.3191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.297503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.228219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.210256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0335413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0324486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Hypoesthesia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoesthesia"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"SMILE (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMILE_(magazine)"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Cap (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
