{"id":19955,"title":"Detection and phylogenetic characterization of a case of Histoplasma capsulatum infection in mainland China.","abstract":"Histoplasmosis usually occurs in specific endemic areas. Sporadic cases have also been reported in mainland China. Here, we described an indigenous case of disseminated histoplasmosis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Histoplasma capsulatum isolated in our case belongs to the Australian clade. Combined with previous studies, it revealed high genetic diversity among Chinese H. capsulatum isolates.
