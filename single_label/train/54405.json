{"id":54405,"title":"Prevalence, awareness, control, and treatment of hypertension and diabetes in korean cancer survivors: a cross-sectional analysis of the fourth and fifth Korea national health and nutrition examination surveys.","abstract":"Management of hypertension and diabetes in cancer survivors is an important issue; however, not much is known about the level of management of such chronic disease in Korea. This study therefore assessed the prevalence, awareness, control, and treatment of hypertension and diabetes in Korean cancer survivors compared to non-cancer survivors.A cross-sectional design was employed, wherein data were obtained from standardized questionnaires completed by 943 cancer survivors and 41,233 non-cancer survivors who participated in the Fourth and Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2007-2011). We calculated adjusted proportions for prevalence and management of hypertension and diabetes in non-cancer survivors and cancer survivors. We also assessed the associated factors with prevalence and management of cancer survivors.Cancer survivors are more likely than the general population to have higher prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension. However, diabetic management was not significantly higher in cancer survivors than in non-cancer survivors, despite their having a higher prevalence. Several factors, such as, age, drinking, years since cancer diagnosis, self-perceived health status, and specific cancer types were found to affect to management of hypertension and diabetes.These data suggest that cancer survivors appear to be better than non-cancer survivors at management of hypertension, but not diabetes. There is a need for healthcare providers to recognize the importance of long-term chronic disease management for cancer survivors and for the care model to be shared between primary care physicians and oncologists.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460354","annotations":[{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Primary care physician","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.528812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.494426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Disease management (health)","weight":0.447707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_management_(health)"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.370839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.274118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.163079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Korean language","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"}]}
