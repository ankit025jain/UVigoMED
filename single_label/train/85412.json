{"id":85412,"title":"Electronic monitoring of symptoms and lung function to assess asthma control in children.","abstract":"Asthma remains poorly controlled in children. Home monitoring of asthma control may help to improve the level of asthma control.To compare 2 methods to assess asthma control: (1) prospective home monitoring, based on daily assessment of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and electronic symptom score, and (2) Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) with retrospective assessment of symptoms and FEV1.Ninety-six children with asthma were prospectively followed up during 1 year. Asthma control was assessed by home monitoring, including an electronic symptom score based on Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria and FEV1 measurements. In the hospital, the ACQ was completed and FEV? was measured. Kappa analysis was performed to assess levels of agreement between the 2 methods.Agreement between the 2 methods was low (? coefficient of 0.393). In 29 children (37%), prospective home monitoring was less optimistic than the retrospective assessment of asthma control by the ACQ.This study found low agreement between asthma control based on GINA criteria by means of prospective home monitoring and the hospital ACQ. The prospective home monitor detected more cases of less well-controlled asthma than the ACQ. However, optimization of adherence to home monitor use is necessary.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24950912","annotations":[{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.257091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.241807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.227058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.0982313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Graphical identification and authentication","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_identification_and_authentication"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"393","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/393"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Electronic tagging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_tagging"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Alkaline copper quaternary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_copper_quaternary"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Optimism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
