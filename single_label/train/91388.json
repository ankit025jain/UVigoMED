{"id":91388,"title":"Neuropsychiatric symptoms and rehabilitation outcomes in patients with hip fracture.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine the association between functional recovery and neuropsychiatric symptoms in hip fracture patients undergoing in-hospital rehabilitation. Very few studies have extensively evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms in hip fracture patients, and the relationship between these symptoms and rehabilitation outcome is not yet clearly defined.This study was conducted on 200 patients with hip fracture who underwent a rehabilitation program. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to identify neuropsychiatric symptoms. Efficiency and effectiveness in terms of the motor-Functional Independence Measure and length of stay were considered as outcome measures.At admission, 74% of the patients had neuropsychiatric symptoms. At the end of rehabilitation, the patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms had a lower motor-Functional Independence Measure effectiveness (P = 0.015) and efficiency (P = 0.002) and a longer length of stay (P = 0.008) than those without neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, after adjustment for the Mini-Mental State Examination, the patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms differed from those without symptoms only in terms of longer length of stay (P = 0.006) and lower motor-Functional Independence Measure efficiency (P = 0.008).Neuropsychiatric symptoms make the rehabilitation process slower and less efficient in hip fracture patients. Understanding the relationship between neuropsychiatric symptoms and outcome may be useful to physicians for the management of hip fracture patients.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508934","annotations":[{"name":"Efficiency","weight":0.170898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Staatsexamen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatsexamen"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"}]}
