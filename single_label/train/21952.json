{"id":21952,"title":"[Development of a novel recombinant BCG for tuberculosis vaccine].","abstract":"A novel recombinant BCG (BCG-DHTM), that was deficient in urease, expressed with gene encoding the fusion of BCG-derived HSP70 and M. tuberculosis-derived major membrane protein (MMP)-II, was constructed for use as a vaccine against tuberculosis. BCG-DHTM efficiently activated dendritic cells (DC) to induce cytokine production, including IL-12, TNFalpha and IL-1beta and phenotypic changes. The DC infected BCG-DHTM was more potent in activation of native T cells of CD4 and CD8 subsets than those infected vector control BCG. The activation of naïve T cells by BCG-DHTM was closely associated with phagomal maturation, and that of naïve CD8+ T cells by BCG-DHTM was induced by the activation of cytosolic cross-presentation pathway. Further, BCG-DHTM seemed to activate native CD4+ T cells and native CD8+ T cells by antigen-specific fashion. The primary infection of BCG-DHTM in C57BL/6 mice for 12 weeks efficiently produced T cells responsive to in vitro secondary stimulation with MMP-II, HSP70 and H37Rv-derived cytosolic protein and inhibited with multiplication of subsequently challenged M. tuberculosis in lungs at least partially. The effect of BCG-DHTM as a vaccine for tuberculosis is not fully convincing and need the improvement, however, our strategy in the development of new recombinant BCG for tuberculosis seems to provide useful tool.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579457","annotations":[{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.895066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.796126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.792414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.734127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.715025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Hsp70","weight":0.692368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsp70"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Membrane protein","weight":0.536687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Urease","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urease"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.40084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.375368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.356148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.327966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"}]}
