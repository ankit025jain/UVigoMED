{"id":30944,"title":"[Forensic medicine as the cradle of toxicology in Russia].","abstract":"Modern toxicology as a science and educational subject originated from forensic medicine in the middle of the XIXth century. In the beginning, selected toxicological problems were taught in the Emperor's Medical Surgical Academy (presently S.M. Kirov Military Medical Academy, Sankt-Peterburg) and at the Medical Faculty of the Moscow University (presently I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow). The greatest contribution to the development of toxicology was made by such outstanding scientists as professors S.A. Gromov, P.P. Pelekhin, P.P. Zablotsky-Desyatovsky, E.V. Pelikan, Ya.A. Chistovich, G.I. Blosfel'd, I.M. Sorokin, D.P. Kosorotov, A.V. Grigoriev, V.V. Andreev, A.A. Glebovich, A.N. Grigoriev, B.I. Predtechensky, V.M. Rozhkov, S.S. Vail, M.N. Lubotsky, etc. The works of these researchers predetermined the further development of toxicology in this country, its main purpose being provision of medical aid in case of poisoning and diseases of chemical etiology. Another line of toxicological research became industrial and environmental toxicology having the purpose of hygienic rating and prevention of poisoning. Nevertheless, all aspects of the multifaceted science of toxicology are related to forensic medicine as the cradle in which it originated, evolved, and turned into a self-consistent science.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432433","annotations":[{"name":"Russia","weight":0.88416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Moscow State University","weight":0.727341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University"},{"name":"Toxicology","weight":0.677663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.543093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.529539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.522689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.489597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Moscow","weight":0.482553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Scientist","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.375548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.279473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.249126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.154529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Medical jurisprudence","weight":0.0322457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_jurisprudence"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Sergey Kirov","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Kirov"},{"name":"19th century","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_century"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Ivan Sechenov","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sechenov"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Earth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"},{"name":"Emperor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor"}]}
