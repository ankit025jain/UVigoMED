{"id":89271,"title":"Do people understand IARC's 2B categorization of RF fields from cell phones?","abstract":"In May 2011, the International Agency on Cancer in Research (IARC) issued an official statement concluding that cell phone usage was \"possibly carcinogenic to humans.\" There have been considerable doubts that non-experts and experts alike fully understood what IARC's categorization actually meant, as \"possibly carcinogenic\" can be interpreted in many ways. The present study is based on an online survey indicating that both the characterization of the probability of carcinogenicity, as well as the description of the risk increase given in the IARC press release, was mostly misunderstood by study participants. Respondents also greatly overestimated the magnitude of the potential risk. Our study results showed that IARC needs to improve their scientific communications.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24737130","annotations":[{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.667574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.466214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.46581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.405887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Press release","weight":0.321231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.313358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.278664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.25402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.115793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"International Agency for Research on Cancer","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer"},{"name":"News media","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Second baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman"},{"name":"Paid survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_survey"},{"name":"Richter magnitude scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Carcinogen","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen"}]}
