{"id":29151,"title":"Sadness, suicide, and drug misuse in Arkansas: results from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey 2011.","abstract":"Exposure to drugs is unfortunately common among high school students and its use has been linked to depression and suicide risk. We used the 2011 Arkansas Youth Risk Behavior Survey to estimate the prevalence of drug abuse and to measure its association with teen suicidality. Three types of substance misuse were reported by more than 10% of Arkansas high school students: cannabis (33.3% ever use). inhalants (18.7% ever use). and prescription drugs without a prescription (13.2% ever use). We found in all suicide outcomes a stronger association with prescription drug abuse, followed by inhalant abuse, then cannabis abuse.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719998","annotations":[{"name":"Inhalant abuse","weight":0.847427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalant_abuse"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.844581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Prescription medication","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_medication"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Over-the-counter drug","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Arkansas","weight":0.568971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.526693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.289281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Substance-related disorder","weight":0.238279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance-related_disorder"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Sadness","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadness"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Youth Risk Behavior Survey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Risk_Behavior_Survey"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Assessment of suicide risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assessment_of_suicide_risk"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"}]}
