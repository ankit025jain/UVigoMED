{"id":30802,"title":"[Contemporary electroencephalographic research on addictive disorders].","abstract":"The aim of the work is an integration of contemporary electroencephalographic data on addictive disorders. A search in e-library, PubMed, EBSCO and Springer databases permitted us to define some of main directions (predisposition, effect of single intake, of dependence, abstinence, and role of comorbidities) and techniques (visual, spectral and coherence analysis, evoked potentials and oscillations) of investigations in that field. Methodology involved in the cited works was taken into account during the process of summarization of results.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24455896","annotations":[{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.604257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.432917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.381533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.380205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Evoked potential","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.0621105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0489124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Springer Science+Business Media","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_Science+Business_Media"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"EBSCO Industries","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBSCO_Industries"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Automatic summarization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Field (physics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)"}]}
