{"id":84724,"title":"[Enhanced Recovery After Surgery--optimal management of the surgical patient].","abstract":"Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal, standardized and evidence-based perioperative care pathway. With ERAS, postoperative complications are significantly lowered, and, as a secondary effect, length of hospital stay and health cost are reduced. The patient recovers better and faster allowing to reduce in addition the workload of healthcare providers. Despite the hospital discharge occurs sooner, there is no increased charge of the outpatient care. ERAS can be safely applied to any patient by a tailored approach. The general practitioner plays an essential role in ERAS by assuring the continuity of the information and the follow-up of the patient.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051597","annotations":[{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.627487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Ambulatory care","weight":0.557256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Workload","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload"},{"name":"Continuity (fiction)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_(fiction)"},{"name":"Indictment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Recovery (Eminem album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_(Eminem_album)"},{"name":"Multimodal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
