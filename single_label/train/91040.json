{"id":91040,"title":"Long-term in vivo experimental investigations on magnesium doped hydroxyapatite bone substitutes.","abstract":"Despite several efforts to find suitable alternatives to autologous bone, no bone substitute currently available provides the same characteristics and properties. Nevertheless, among the wide range of materials proposed as bone substitutes, calcium phosphate materials represent the most promising category and the present study is aimed at improving the knowledge on non-stoichiometric magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite substitutes (Mg-HA), tested in two different formulations: Mg-HA Putty and Mg-HA Granules. These bone substitutes were implanted bilaterally into iliac crest bone defects in healthy sheep and comparative histological, histomorphometric, microhardness and ultrastructural assessments were performed 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery to elucidate bone tissue apposition, mineralization and material degradation in vivo. The results confirmed that the biomimetic bone substitutes provide a histocompatible and osteoconductive structural support, during the bone formation process, and give essential information about the in vivo resorption process and biological behavior of biomimetic bone substitutes.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and
