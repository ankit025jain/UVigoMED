{"id":89107,"title":"[Case-control study on locking plates fixation for the treatment of Neer 3-and 4-part proximal humerus fractures].","abstract":"To compare therapeutic effects of locking plates for the treatment of Neer 3-and 4-part proximal humerus fractures.From January 2009 to June 2011, 64 patients with Neer 3-and 4-part proximal humerus fractures were treated with locked plate fixation. There were 39 patients in the 3-part group including 16 males and 23 females, with an average age of (55.12 +/- 12.52) years old; and 25 patients in the 4-part fractures group including 9 males and 16 females,with an average age of (57.92 +/- 13.14) years old. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES), visual analogue scale (VAS) and complications were documented for analysis before and after treatment.All the patients had incision healing at the first stage. All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 12 to 30 months, with a mean of 16.5 months. Comparably better shoulder function recovery was achieved in the 3-part fractures group with regard to the ASES (76.14 +/- 14.10 in the 3-part fractures group vs. 65.93 +/- 11.82 in the 4-part fractures group, P < 0.05). Moreover,a statistical difference (P < 0.05) was observed regarding the VAS pain score (2.12 +/- 1.63 in the 3-part fractures group vs. 3.90 +/- 2.21 in the 4-part fractures group). For the complications rate,no statistical difference was noted between 3-part fractures group and 4-part fractures group (20.51% vs. 36.00%).The clinical outcomes of the 3-part proximal humerus fractures is better than the 4-part fractures proximal humerus fractures treated with locking plate. Complex proximal humeral fractures treated with locking plates can be achieved a satisfactory outcome when attention is paid to anatomic reduction, stable fixation, proper screws and plate placement, and reasonable functional exercise postoperative.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754143","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.567703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.291697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.287909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.225773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.200556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.0310958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.027311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Neer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neer"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Analogy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
