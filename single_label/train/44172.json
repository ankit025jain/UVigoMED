{"id":44172,"title":"MicroRNA-194 inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer cells by targeting FoxM1.","abstract":"We hypothesized that miR-194 may control Forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) expression in gastric cancer cells and therefore may have therapeutic potential in gastric cancer.The expression level of miR-194 was examined using real-time PCR in human gastric cancer and noncancerous gastric tissues, gastric cancer cell and normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell. We examined whether the miR-194 regulates cell migration and invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition Phenotype by inhibiting FoxM1 in gastric cancer cells.The expression of miR-194 was significantly lower in gastric cancer compared with non-cancerous gastric tissues and cells. Exogenous expression of miR-194 inhibited cell migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, we discovered a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of FoxM1 expression that is mediated by miR-194.Our study clearly demonstrates that miR-194 inhibits the acquisition of the EMT phenotype in gastric cancer cells by downregulating FoxM1, thereby inhibiting cell migration and invasion during cancer progression.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748184","annotations":[{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.715403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.5799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.510774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.442829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.299593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"FOX proteins","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOX_proteins"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Gastric mucosa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_mucosa"},{"name":"Animal migration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_migration"},{"name":"Emergency medical technician","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician"}]}
