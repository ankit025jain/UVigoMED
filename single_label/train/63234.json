{"id":63234,"title":"Antithymocyte globulin before allogeneic stem cell transplantation for progressive myelodysplastic syndrome: a study from the French Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.","abstract":"We investigated the impact of rabbit antithymocyte globulins (ATG) on patient outcomes after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for progressive myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Of the 242 consecutive patients who underwent allo-SCT for progressive MDS between October 1999 and December 2009, 93 received ATG (ATG group) at the median dose of 5 mg/kg, whereas 149 patients did not (no-ATG group). Donors were sibling (n = 153) or HLA-matched unrelated (n = 89). Patients received blood (n = 90) or marrow (n = 152) grafts after either myeloablative (n = 109) or reduced-intensity (n = 133) conditioning. Three-year overall and event-free survival, nonrelapse mortality, relapse, and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) development were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In contrast, acute grade II to IV GVHD occurred more often in the no-ATG group (55% of the patients) than in the ATG group (27%, P < .0001). Similar results were observed with acute grade III to IV GVHD (28% and 14% in the no-ATG group and ATG group, respectively; P = .009). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment with propensity score, the absence of ATG was the strongest parameter associated with an increased risk of acute grade II to IV GVHD (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.35 to 3.37; P = .001]. ATG had no impact on overall and event-free survival or cumulative incidence of the relapse. In conclusion, the addition of ATG to allo-SCT conditioning did not increase the incidence of relapse of patients with progressive MDS. The incidence of acute GVHD was decreased without compromising outcomes.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462982","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.827475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.69924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.683663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.669087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.625983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.551382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Graft-versus-host disease","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anti-thymocyte globulin","weight":0.236837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-thymocyte_globulin"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.155186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"France","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Sibling","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cumulative incidence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_incidence"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
