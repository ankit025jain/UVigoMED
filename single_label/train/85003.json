{"id":85003,"title":"[Observation of the lungs using ultrasonography].","abstract":"The three ways to observe the lungs using ultrasonography are transthoracic echography, transesophageal echography and endobronchial ultrasonography. All methods have their own advantages. Consolidation and pleural effusion are evaluated with transthoracic echography and transesophageal echography. The advent of comet-tail artifact observation made the transthoracic echography worthwhile.","date":"2014-09-26","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25255657","annotations":[{"name":"Lung","weight":0.196096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.0229389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Artifact (archaeology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
