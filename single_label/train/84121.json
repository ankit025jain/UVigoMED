{"id":84121,"title":"[Effects of polymorphisms in XRCC1 and APE1 on vinyl chloride-induced chromosome damage].","abstract":"To evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in XRCC1 and APE1 genes on vinyl chloride (VC)-induced chromosomal damage in peripheral lymphocytes.In this study, 317 workers occupationally exposed to VC were recruited from a factory in Shandong Province, China. The micronucleus (MN) frequency in peripheral lymphocytes was used as an indicator of chromosomal damage. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and created restriction site combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to determine the five single nucleotide polymorphisms in XRCC1 and APE1 genes in the base excision repair pathway. The association of chromosomal damage with these polymorphisms and the haplotype of XRCC1 was analyzed using Poisson regression and PHASE 2.0.2.It was found that among the VC-exposed workers, individuals with XRCC1 polymorphisms (-77C/T, Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) had a significantly higher MN frequency than those with homozygous wild-type genotypes, with frequency ratios (FR) as follows, respectively: FR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.05?1.39 (P < 0.05); FR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.00?1.38 (P < 0.05); FR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.11?1.44 (P < 0.05); FR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.08?1.46 (P < 0.05). APE1 Asp148Glu was found of no significant relationship with MN frequency. Haplotype analysis of XRCC1 demonstrated that the MN frequencies in subjects with CTAA/CTAA and CCAA/CTAA were significantly higher than that in those with TCGG/TCGG (FR = 1.19, 95%CI: 1.02?1.32, P < 0.05; FR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.02?1.87, P < 0.05). Furthermore, association was found between accumulated exposure to VC and XRCC1 polymorphisms (-77C/T, Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) after adjustment for age, sex, drinking, and smoking.VC can induce chromosomal damage even when the exposure level is lower than the national occupational health standard of China (PC-TWA: 10 mg/m(3)); the polymorphisms in XRCC1 and APE1 are associated with chromosomal damage induced by VC.","date":"2014-08-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25169084","annotations":[{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Haplotype","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.814555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.768836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Glutamine","weight":0.76183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine"},{"name":"Tryptophan","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Micronucleus","weight":0.698359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronucleus"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.66717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Excision repair","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excision_repair"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.590335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"China","weight":0.531639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.361396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Vinyl chloride","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinyl_chloride"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.333641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.315878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.282513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.0929099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Base excision repair","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_excision_repair"},{"name":"Restriction site","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_site"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Restriction fragment","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment"}]}
