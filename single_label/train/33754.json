{"id":33754,"title":"In search of the ideal pulmonary blood source for the Norwood procedure: a meta-analysis and systematic review.","abstract":"A clear consensus regarding the optimal source of pulmonary blood flow in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome undergoing the Norwood procedure is lacking.A literature search was undertaken to identify relevant articles from 2005 to 2012 using \"Norwood, stage 1 palliation,\" \"Modified Blalock Taussig shunt (MBTS),\" \"right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt (RV-PAS)\" alone or in combination. Three end points were selected: early/stage 1 mortality, interstage mortality, and interstage total/shunt intervention.A total of 20 articles, including 19 observational studies and 1 randomized trial (MBTS, n=1,343; RV-PAS, n=1,028), met the inclusion criteria. Mortality after stage 1 was 22% in the MBTS cohort and 16% in RV-PAS cohort. A pooled analysis showed no difference in early mortality between the two groups (risk ratio [RR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99 to 1.45; p=0.07). On pooling data from contemporary series (similar era) of 8 studies (MBTS, n=709; RV-PAS, n=631), to minimize variability in surgical and postoperative management practices, early mortality in both cohorts was comparable (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.45; p=0.29). Interstage mortality was 13.8% and 4.6% in the MBTS and RV-PAS cohorts, respectively, and was significantly lower for RV-PAS (RR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.65 to 4.89; p<0.00002). However, patients with MBTS had fewer shunt interventions (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.68; p<0.001; I2=00%).Our pooled analysis demonstrated no survival benefit for the MBTS or RV-PAS in patients undergoing the Norwood procedure. There appears to be an advantage with the RV-PAS with regard to interstage mortality at the cost of an increased rate of shunt intervention.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Congenital Hereditary
