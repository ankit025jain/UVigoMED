{"id":71242,"title":"How safe is curettage of low-grade cartilaginous neoplasms diagnosed by imaging with or without pre-operative needle biopsy?","abstract":"The pre-operative differentiation between enchondroma, low-grade chondrosarcoma and high-grade chondrosarcoma remains a diagnostic challenge. We reviewed the accuracy and safety of the radiological grading of cartilaginous tumours through the assessment of, first, pre-operative radiological and post-operative histological agreement, and second the rate of recurrence in lesions confirmed as high-grade on histology. We performed a retrospective review of major long bone cartilaginous tumours managed by curettage as low grade between 2001 and 2012. A total of 53 patients with a mean age of 47.6 years (8 to 71) were included. There were 23 men and 30 women. The tumours involved the femur (n = 20), humerus (n = 18), tibia (n = 9), fibula (n = 3), radius (n = 2) and ulna (n = 1). Pre-operative diagnoses resulted from multidisciplinary consensus following radiological review alone for 35 tumours, or with the addition of pre-operative image guided needle biopsy for 18. The histologically confirmed diagnosis was enchondroma for two (3.7%), low-grade chondrosarcoma for 49 (92.6%) and high-grade chondrosarcoma for two (3.7%). Three patients with a low-grade tumour developed a local recurrence at a mean of 15 months (12 to 17) post-operatively. A single high-grade recurrence (grade II) was treated with tibial diaphyseal replacement. The overall recurrence rate was 7.5% at a mean follow-up of 4.7 years (1.2 to 12.3). Cartilaginous tumours identified as low-grade on pre-operative imaging with or without additional image-guided needle biopsy can safely be managed as low-grade without pre-operative histological diagnosis. A few tumours may demonstrate high-grade features histologically, but the rates of recurrence are not affected.","date":"2014-08-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086127","annotations":[{"name":"Chondrosarcoma","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrosarcoma"},{"name":"Ulna","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.88388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"},{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.876726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.860937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Enchondroma","weight":0.837017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchondroma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.788095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.781447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Curettage","weight":0.732277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curettage"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.677915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.598879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.459644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.456885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.238355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.129368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"}]}
