{"id":64201,"title":"[Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock].","abstract":"The anaphylactic shock is an acute, multisystemic and potentially fatal circulatory insufficiency, secondary to an allergic reaction. The prevalence of anaphylaxis is underestimated in the general population. Many studies have reported a prevalence of 0.05-2%. Multiple etiologies are incriminated in the pathogenesis of anaphylaxis, and these etiologies vary depending on age and geographic zones. The clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis are multiple, owing to the multisystemic character of this pathology. The gold standard in management of anaphylaxis is thought to be the rapid and early administration of epinephrine by intra-muscular route. The prevention of anaphylaxis remains the treatment of choice. Educating the patient is an important aspect of anaphylaxis follow-up along with the prescription of epinephrine autoinjectors.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199227","annotations":[{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.8371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Epinephrine","weight":0.809561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.786872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.677395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.513021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.35847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.338178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.337219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.314997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.211987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.170044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Anaphylactic shock","weight":0.0961346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylactic_shock"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.0646211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
