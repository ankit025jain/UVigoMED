{"id":52346,"title":"[Sonographic evaluation of myopathy].","abstract":"The imaging of muscle fibers has been utilized in the management of patients with suspected myopathy. Ultrasonography (US) of skeletal muscles has advantages over MRI and CT in that US can quickly assess muscles in the entire body. US findings in myopathy are diffuse (e.g., increased or decreased echo signal in muscular dystrophy and myositis) and focal (e.g., a mass in sarcoid myopathy, or preferential involvement in inclusion body myositis). US evaluation is useful in determining the potential site for a muscle biopsy, where an adequate degree of myopathy should be present. Further studies will reveal the correlation between the sonographic findings as well as clinical and other imaging abnormalities.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607949","annotations":[{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.855742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.691339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Sarcoidosis","weight":0.6682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoidosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.634769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.492405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.401933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Inclusion body myositis","weight":0.319444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_body_myositis"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Inclusion body","weight":0.274202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_body"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Muscle biopsy","weight":0.117087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_biopsy"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Myositis","weight":0.0409614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myositis"},{"name":"Echo (phenomenon)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(phenomenon)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
