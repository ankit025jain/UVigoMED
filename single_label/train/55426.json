{"id":55426,"title":"Relationship between the area of isopters and Vigabatrin dosage during two years of observation.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between the area of isopters obtained using semi-automated kinetic perimetry (SKP) and Vigabatrin dosage in epilepsy patients with pretreatment baseline examination during 2-years of the follow-up.29 epilepsy patients were included into the study, but 15 individuals were excluded due to cognitive impairment, intracranial pathologies or eye diseases. Finally, 14 patients were examined with SKP before VGB treatment and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Reaction time (RT)-corrected areas of three isopters (III4e, I4e and I2e) were measured for each of five examinations and compared intra-individually during 2-years period. Additionally, six epilepsy patients on other antiepileptic drugs were examined five times with SKP as a control.There was a significant decrease of I2e, I4e and III4e isopters' area during the follow-up of two years. Correlation was found between the I2e isopter's area and both cumulative dose and mean daily dose of VGB. With increasing RT, there was decreasing of all isopters' area in patients receiving VGB. In epilepsy patients who were not receiving VGB, there were no significance differences in isopters' area during follow-up.There was attenuation of area of III4e, I4e and I2e isopters obtained with SKP during a period of 2 years. RT, the cumulative dose and the mean daily dose of VGB influenced isopters' area obtained with SKP.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885864","annotations":[{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.738373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Anticonvulsant","weight":0.607044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant"},{"name":"Vigabatrin","weight":0.544348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigabatrin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.454221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.391177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Mental chronometry","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_chronometry"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.288149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cognitive dysfunction","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.0644769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Inline-four engine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-four_engine"},{"name":"Perimetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimetry"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"British Virgin Islands","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Virgin_Islands"},{"name":"Kinetic energy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"RT (TV network)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Cumulative dose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_dose"}]}
