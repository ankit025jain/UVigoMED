{"id":62548,"title":"der(5;17)(p10;q10) is a recurrent but rare whole-arm translocation in patients with hematological neoplasms: a report of three cases.","abstract":"We report the cases of 3 patients with hematological malignancies and complex karyotypes involving der(5; 17) (p10;q10), which results in the loss of 5q and 17p. Although deletions of 5q and 17p are recurrent abnormalities in hematological disease, only about 20 cases harboring der(5; 17) (p10;q10) have been reported. We address the tumorigenesis and morphological characteristics of hematological malignancies involving der(5; 17)(p10;q10), along with a review of the literature.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24556628","annotations":[{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.713424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.699037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.570054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.371201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.363954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.138889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"}]}
