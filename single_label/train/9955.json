{"id":9955,"title":"[Effect of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation in pigs with rapid pacing induced heart failure].","abstract":"This study investigated the effect of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) in pigs with rapid pacing induced heart failure.Heart failure was induced by rapid right ventricular pacing in 12 pigs and pigs were randomly divided into RDN group (n = 6): pacing+RDN at 7 days post pacing; control group (n = 6): pacing only. Echocardiography examination (LVEF, LVEDD and LVESD) was performed before pacing and at 1 and 2 weeks post pacing. Serum biochemical markers including renin, aldosterone and creatinine were also measured at baseline, 1 and 2 weeks after pacing. Repeated renal artery angiography was performed at 1 week after RDN. All pigs were sacrificed to examine the heart and renal pathology and renal artery sympathetic nerve staining at 2 weeks post pacing.LVEF decreased 1 week after rapid pacing from (60.5 ± 6.0)% to (35.3 ± 9.8)%. LVEF was significantly higher [(42.8 ± 5.9) % vs. (33.4 ± 9.7)%, P = 0.001 8] while LVESD was significantly lower [(28.4 ± 3.7) mm vs. (33.0 ± 2.0) mm, P = 0.001 6] in the RDN group than in the control group at 2 weeks post pacing. At 2 weeks after pacing, plasma concentrations of renin and aldosterone were significantly lower in RDN group compared to the control group (all P < 0.05) . Kidney function and blood pressure were comparable between the two groups at 2 weeks post pacing. There were no signs of renal damages such as renal artery stenosis, dissection and thrombus in all pigs after 2 weeks pacing. Sympathetic neurons of adventitia were injured in RND group.RDN could significantly improve cardiac function and attenuate left ventricular remodeling via inhibiting renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in this pacing induced pig heart failure model.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Animal
