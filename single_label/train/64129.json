{"id":64129,"title":"A novel Fc?RIIa Q27W gene variant is associated with common variable immune deficiency through defective Fc?RIIa downstream signaling.","abstract":"We identified a novel Q27W Fc?RIIa variant that was found more frequently in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) or CVID-like children. We analyzed the possible functional consequence of the Q27W Fc?RIIa mutation in human cells. We used peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Q27W Fc?RIIa patients and healthy controls, and cultured cells that overexpress the Q27W and common Fc?RIIa variants. The Q27W Fc?RIIa mutation does not disrupt Fc?RIIa surface expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Mononuclear cells express multiple Fc?R, precluding careful analysis of Q27W Fc?RIIa functional deviation. For functional analysis of Fc?RIIa function, we therefore overexpressed the Q27W Fc?RIIa and common Fc?RIIa variant in IIA1.6 cells that are normally deficient in Fc?R. We show that Fc?RIIa triggering-induced signaling is obstructed, as measured by both decrease in calcium flux and defective MAPK phosphorylation. In conclusion, we here describe a novel Q27W Fc?RIIa variant that causes delayed downstream signaling. This variant may contribute to CVID.
