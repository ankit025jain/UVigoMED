{"id":9437,"title":"Complete genome sequence and pathogenesis of bovine viral diarrhea virus JL-1 isolate from cattle in China.","abstract":"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pathogen found worldwide in calves. It can cause significant economic losses in agriculture. Many BVDV strains have been isolated in China. However, the pathogenesis and complete gene characteristics of BVDV isolate have yet not been reported in China. Here, a BVDV isolate was isolated and its pathogenesis and complete genome were studied.A new isolate of bovine viral diarrhea virus, named JL-1, was isolated from the spleen of a sick cow with diarrhea using MDBK cell culture. The complete genome of JL-1 is 12,276 nucleotides and contains a 5'-UTR of 382 nucleotides, a 3'-UTR of 188 nucleotides, and a large ORF encoding a polyprotein consisting of 3,901 amino acids. Genomic comparison and phylogenetic analyses of complete genomic sequence clearly showed that JL-1 fell into the BVDV-1b subtype. The result of pathogenesis of JL-1 strain showed that all infected calves developed clinical signs of elevated rectal temperatures, decreased leucopenia, and viral discharge. Viral antigen was detected in infected animal tissues using immunohistochemistry. Animals in the mock were normal. These results demonstrated that BVDV JL-1 was a virulent strain.This is the first study to report the pathogenesis and complete gene characterization of the BVDV strain in China. This report may set a good foundation for further study of BVDV in China.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708732","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.836183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.796634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"China","weight":0.760334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Flaviviridae","weight":0.737545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaviviridae"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Open reading frame","weight":0.725212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.636602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.551292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.547122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.526023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.46853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.421713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Bovine virus diarrhea","weight":0.358226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_virus_diarrhea"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.356024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.301782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Calf","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"}]}
