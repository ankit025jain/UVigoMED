{"id":74247,"title":"[Radiobiology of ablative dose in stereotactic irradiation: data update].","abstract":"Stereotactic radiotherapy is a radiation technique, which is becoming more and more available and applicable for physicians. A good efficacy and safety are observed in clinical practice. However, the radiobiology of ablative radiation is still under question. The radiobiological principles of the 5R have to be discussed. The roles of hypoxia and vascularization, more specifically, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis seem to be dominating.
