{"id":64140,"title":"Food allergy testing.","abstract":"Food allergy (IgE-mediated hypersensitivity) is a common clinical problem affecting approximately 15% of children in the Western world. These hypersensitivity reactions tend to be \"immediate\" (typically within minutes of food exposure), and clinical features may range from mild to life threatening (anaphylaxis). Detailed clinical history is critical to correct diagnosis. Available laboratory tests have limitations not least poor positive predictive value and limited repertoire. Laboratory tests should support clinical diagno sis not vice versa.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25233614","annotations":[{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.775211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.742884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.691498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.644842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.644814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.326483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"SIS (file format)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIS_(file_format)"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
