{"id":80161,"title":"Novel genotyping tools for investigating transmission dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum.","abstract":"Differentiation between gametocyte-producing Plasmodium falciparum clones depends on both high levels of stage-specific transcripts and high genetic diversity of the selected genotyping marker obtained by a high-resolution typing method. By analyzing consecutive samples of one host, the contribution of each infecting clone to transmission and the dynamics of gametocyte production in multiclone infections can be studied.We have evaluated capillary electrophoresis based differentiation of 6 length-polymorphic gametocyte genes. RNA and DNA of 25 ÂµL whole blood from 46 individuals from Burkina Faso were simultaneously genotyped.Highest discrimination power was achieved by pfs230 with 18 alleles, followed by pfg377 with 15 alleles. When assays were performed in parallel on RNA and DNA, 85.7% of all pfs230 samples and 59.5% of all pfg377 samples contained at least one matching genotype in DNA and RNA.The imperfect detection in both, DNA and RNA, was identified as major limitation for investigating transmission dynamics, owing primarily to the volume of blood processed and the incomplete representation of all clones in the sample tested. Abundant low-density gametocyte carriers impede clone detectability, which may be improved by analyzing larger volumes and detecting initially sequestered gametocyte clones in follow-up samples.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771862","annotations":[{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.741196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.705816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Capillary","weight":0.655428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.600262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.569721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Capillary electrophoresis","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.326372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.26041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gametocyte","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gametocyte"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.16113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Burkina Faso","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Trade paperback (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_paperback_(comics)"},{"name":"Blood volume","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Whole blood","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_blood"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Flower","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower"}]}
