{"id":44956,"title":"The effectiveness of endoscopic submucosal resection with a ligation device for small rectal carcinoid tumors: focused on previously biopsied tumors.","abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic submucosal resection with a ligation device (ESMR-L) on histologic complete resection for the treatment of small rectal carcinoid tumors in comparison with the treatment with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) alone.Thirty-five patients with small rectal carcinoid tumors were enrolled prospectively for ESMR-L, and we retrospectively reviewed 74 carcinoid tumor patients who underwent EMR. The comparison between ESMR-L and EMR groups was analyzed including endoscopic and histologic complete resection and complications after resection. We also evaluated the associations of histologic complete resection with clinical and procedure-related factors.The histologic complete resection rate was significantly higher in ESMR-L than in EMR (94.3% vs. 75.7%, P=0.019). In addition, the resection time was significantly shorter in ESMR-L than in EMR (4.16±1.48 min vs. 5.11±2.47 min, respectively, P=0.014). Moreover, previously biopsied rectal carcinoid tumors were significantly associated with histologic incomplete resection, especially in patients who underwent EMR (odds ratio, 6.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.92-20.58; P=0.002).Compared with EMR, ESMR-L is a safe and effective method for histologic complete resection of small rectal carcinoid tumors, especially in patients with previously biopsied carcinoid tumors.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710234","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoid","weight":0.724116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoid"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.554032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.424734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.416559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.367494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.205909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Electronic medical record","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_medical_record"}]}
