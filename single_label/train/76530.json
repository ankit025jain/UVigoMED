{"id":76530,"title":"Heme oxygenase-1 drives metaflammation and insulin resistance in mouse and man.","abstract":"Obesity and diabetes affect more than half a billion individuals worldwide. Interestingly, the two conditions do not always coincide and the molecular determinants of \"healthy\" versus \"unhealthy\" obesity remain ill-defined. Chronic metabolic inflammation (metaflammation) is believed to be pivotal. Here, we tested a hypothesized anti-inflammatory role for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the development of metabolic disease. Surprisingly, in matched biopsies from \"healthy\" versus insulin-resistant obese subjects we find HO-1 to be among the strongest positive predictors of metabolic disease in humans. We find that hepatocyte and macrophage conditional HO-1 deletion in mice evokes resistance to diet-induced insulin resistance and inflammation, dramatically reducing secondary disease such as steatosis and liver toxicity. Intriguingly, cellular assays show that HO-1 defines prestimulation thresholds for inflammatory skewing and NF-?B amplification in macrophages and for insulin signaling in hepatocytes. These findings identify HO-1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995976","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.871778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Heme","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.783109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.711557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.637795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.587584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.405451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.373346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.259055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Heme oxygenase","weight":0.224236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme_oxygenase"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"1000000000 (number)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number)"},{"name":"Secondary structure","weight":0.0201839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_structure"},{"name":"Oxygenase","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenase"}]}
