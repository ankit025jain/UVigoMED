{"id":10607,"title":"Advancement flap as a novel treatment for a pododermatitis lesion in a red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis).","abstract":"Pododermatitis is a pathologic condition commonly reported in captive raptors and characterized by swelling, excoriation, ulceration, cellulitis, or abscessation of the plantar aspect of the foot. Its cause can be multifactorial, often involving abnormal weight bearing or poor sanitation, and medical and surgical techniques, in addition to environmental alterations, are hallmarks of treatment. In this case, a single pedicle advancement flap was used to treat chronic, nonresponsive grade V/VII pododermatitis of the right metatarsal pad in a red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis). The advancement flap was formed by using the interdigital skin between digits 3 and 4. The double layer of skin was incised and separated, and the leading edge of the flap was then advanced over the defect and secured with simple interrupted subcutaneous and skin sutures. The foot was bandaged after surgery to take pressure off the surgical site. At 58 days after the surgery, the hawk was deemed medically sound with no signs of pododermatitis and was released to a wildlife rehabilitator. The use of a single pedicle advancement flap has not previously been reported for the treatment of pododermatitis.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640931","annotations":[{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.757534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.739625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.706758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.689589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.405804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.314409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.275756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.128444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.117639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.11369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Wildlife","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Hawk","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Double (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Buteo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buteo"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Leading edge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_edge"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Water supply and sanitation in Ethiopia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Ethiopia"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Plantar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar"},{"name":"Red-tailed Hawk","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_Hawk"},{"name":"Bumblefoot (infection)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblefoot_(infection)"},{"name":"Civilization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Excoriation","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excoriation"},{"name":"Bird of prey","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_of_prey"}]}
