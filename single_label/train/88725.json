{"id":88725,"title":"Radiation-induced osteosarcoma of the hand: case report.","abstract":"Radiation-associated sarcomas represent less than 5% of all sarcomas and can arise from previously irradiated bone or soft tissue. We report a case of radiation-associated osteosarcoma that developed in the hand of a patient who had previously been treated for synovial sarcoma. Despite aggressive, multimodality treatment, the disease progressed rapidly. This case highlights the need for patients and treating physicians to be aware of this potential complication of radiotherapy to the hand.
