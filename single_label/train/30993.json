{"id":30993,"title":"Comorbidity of obsessive-compulsive disorder and substance use disorder: a new heuristic.","abstract":"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and substance use disorder share several aspects of phenomenology and may be underpinned by a common mechanism with compulsivity at the core. Despite this overlap, the two disorders show a variable pattern of comorbidity. Here, we review the current evidence for comorbidity across clinical and epidemiological studies, and propose a new heuristic for substance use comorbidity in OCD, based on a hypothetical threshold of OCD severity.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24424710","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Phenomenology (philosophy)","weight":0.710405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Obsessive-compulsive disorder","weight":0.584759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.416699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Substance use disorder","weight":0.303079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.301841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Heuristic","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.107057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Conscientiousness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness"},{"name":"Underpinning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpinning"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
