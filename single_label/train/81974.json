{"id":81974,"title":"[Burning mouth syndrome (glossalgia)].","abstract":"Burning mouth syndrome (glossalgia) is manifested by oral pin and tingling sensations, numbness and even burning and severe pains, more frequently in the tongue. Unpleasant sensations may involve the anterior two thirds of the tongue or be extended to the front part of the hard palate and the mucous membrane of the lower lip. This condition is characterized by \"mirror\" and \"food dominant\" symptoms, disordered salivation, dysgeusia, or psychological disorders. The disease shows a chronic course. Its etiology may be multifactorial. There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria; the diagnosis of glossalgia is made to rule out all other causes. A thorough examination should be conducted to establish a differential diagnosis. Glossalgia occurs primarily in middle-aged and elderly people. Women get sick much more frequently than men of the same age. Glossalgia remains difficult to treat. Continuous symptomatic treatment and follow-up help relieve its symptoms.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757710","annotations":[{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Dysgeusia","weight":0.807678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgeusia"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Paresthesia","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.772813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.693799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.585048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.499803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.371201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.341081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Glossodynia","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossodynia"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.305645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Hard palate","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_palate"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.242331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.0726699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.061187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Mirror","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"}]}
