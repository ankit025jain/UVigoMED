{"id":18127,"title":"Aneurysm formation and infection in AV prosthesis.","abstract":"In contrast to autogenous arteriovenous (AV) fistulae where true aneurysms are the most frequent type, aneurysms in prosthetic AV grafts are mostly false aneurysms and less frequently anastomotic ones. Indications for repair comprise false aneurysms exceeding twofold the graft diameter, those with rapid enlargement or with skin thinning or erosion, the ruptured, those causing pain or severely limiting the cannulable area and the infected ones. They can be managed either with conventional surgery or with endovascular techniques; However, conventional surgery represents the current standard treatment consisting of either aneurysm resection and interposition graft in situ or resection/exclusion and bypass via a new route to avoid a potentially contaminated area.
