{"id":91909,"title":"Improvements in hip muscle performance result in increased use of the hip extensors and abductors during a landing task.","abstract":"Impaired hip muscle performance has been implicated as a contributing factor to the increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in women.To determine the influence of a hip-focused training program on lower extremity biomechanics during a drop-jump task.Descriptive laboratory study.Twenty-one recreationally active women (18-25 years of age) participated in a 4-week training program consisting of hip-focused plyometric and balance perturbation exercises (3 times/wk, 30 min/session). Maximum isometric strength of the hip extensors, hip abductors, and knee extensors was assessed, along with lower extremity biomechanics during a drop-jump task. All assessments were performed within 5 days of initiation and completion of the training program.After training, subjects demonstrated significantly greater maximum isometric strength of the hip extensors (2.87 ± 0.7 vs 3.11 ± 0.7 N·m/kg; P < .01) and hip abductors (2.08 ± 0.7 vs 2.23 ± 0.07 N·m/kg; P = .004). No significant difference in knee extensor strength was observed. After training, subjects landed with significantly greater peak knee flexion (94.0° ± 8.5° vs 98.0° ± 10.1°; P < .001) and hip flexion (83.4° ± 7.6° vs 89.9° ± 8.8°; P = .008) and a lower knee/hip extensor moment ratio (1.33 ± 0.6 vs 0.99 ± 0.3; P = .001). In addition, subjects demonstrated significantly lower peak knee abduction angles (6.8° ± 3.3° vs 5.6° ± 3.1°; P = .04) and average knee adductor moments (0.06 ± 0.1 vs -0.02 ± 0.1 N·m/kg; P < .001).Changes in lower extremity biomechanics consistent with decreased risk for ACL injury were observed after participation in a hip-focused training program.The study results suggest that ACL injury prevention programs targeting hip muscle performance may be important in mitigating biomechanical risk factors associated with ACL injury in women.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464929","annotations":[{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Plyometrics","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.695251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Abduction (kinesiology)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.660345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.634161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.586488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.573635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Rectus femoris muscle","weight":0.440883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_femoris_muscle"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.279537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.0478563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Isometric exercise","weight":0.047649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_exercise"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Injury prevention","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"1825","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1825"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Landing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Torque","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"}]}
