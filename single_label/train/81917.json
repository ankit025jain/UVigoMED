{"id":81917,"title":"Management of the single discoloured tooth. Part 1: Aetiology, prevention and minimally invasive restorative options.","abstract":"The single discoloured tooth is commonly encountered in general practice. This is the first of two articles covering the broad range of management options for the single discoloured tooth. This first part outlines the common causes of discoloration and possible methods of prevention. Minimally invasive techniques are covered. Clinical procedures are outlined and clinical cases used to demonstrate outcomes that can be achieved.The single discoloured tooth is a commonly encountered clinical problem in general dental practice. A wide variety of management options exist and any one in particular may be most appropriate given the clinical scenario. It is therefore essential that general dental practitioners are familiar with the range of options that exist, as well as their indications, and consider adopting minimally invasive techniques in the first instance before moving to more invasive therapies.","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783878","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.281557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Familiar spirit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_spirit"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Livor mortis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livor_mortis"}]}
