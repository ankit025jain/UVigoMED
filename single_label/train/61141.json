{"id":61141,"title":"Pomalidomide.","abstract":"Pomalidomide (originally CC-4047 or 3-amino-thalidomide) is a derivative of thalidomide that is antiangiogenic and also acts as an immunomodulator. Pomalidomide, as the newest immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), has shown substantial in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. In vivo studies have suggested limited cross-resistance between lenalidomide and pomalidomide, and the response of pomalidomide in relapsed and refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM) patients, including those who are refractory to both lenalidomide and bortezomib, has induced notable enthusiasm. Several studies have evaluated continuous (2 mg/day) or alternate (5 mg/2 day) dose schedules of pomalidomide, as well as 2 versus 4 mg schedules, and pomalidomide alone versus in combination with dexamethasone or other antimyeloma agents. Since pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone has shown better responses, progression-free and overall survival than high-dose dexamethasone or pomalidomide alone, subsequent trials investigating pomalidomide combination therapy have been initiated. Among these trials combinations with alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, bendamustin), anthracyclins (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib), and various others can be found. Pomalidomide has also been assessed in AL amyloidosis, MPNs (myelofibrosis [MF]), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, solid tumors (sarcoma, lung cancer), or HIV and--for AL amyloidosis and MF--has already proven remarkable activity. Due to its potency, pomalidomide was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for RRMM in 2/2013 and has also been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756804","annotations":[{"name":"Proteasome","weight":0.933358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Bortezomib","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Lenalidomide","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide"},{"name":"Myelofibrosis","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelofibrosis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Amyloidosis","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.807791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"Thalidomide","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.771006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"European Medicines Agency","weight":0.738863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.642332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.599803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.330911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.33044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Alkylating antineoplastic agent","weight":0.317401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylating_antineoplastic_agent"},{"name":"Erectile dysfunction","weight":0.234085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Alkylation","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylation"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Macroglobulinemia","weight":0.0200714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroglobulinemia"},{"name":"European Union","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"}]}
