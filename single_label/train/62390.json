{"id":62390,"title":"The BLNK adaptor protein has a nonredundant role in human B-cell differentiation.","abstract":"Expression of the pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR) by pre-BII cells constitutes a crucial checkpoint in B-cell differentiation. Mutations that affect the pre-B-cell receptor result in early B-cell differentiation blockades that lead to primary B-cell immunodeficiencies. BLNK adaptor protein has a key role in the pre-B-cell receptor signaling cascade, as illustrated by the abnormal B-cell development in the 4 patients with BLNK gene defects reported to date. However, the BLNK protein's precise function in human B-cell differentiation has not been completely specified.B-cell development, including IgVH and Vk chain repertoires analysis, was studied in the bone marrow of a new case of BLNK deficiency in vitro and in vivo.Here, we report on a patient with agammaglobulinemia, with a total absence of circulating B cells. We detected a homozygous mutation in BLNK, which leads to the complete abrogation of BLNK protein expression. In the bone marrow, we identified a severe differentiation blockade at the pre-BI- to pre-BII-cell transition. IgVH gene rearrangements and selection of the IgH repertoire were normal, whereas the patient's pre-BI cells showed very restricted usage of the IgV? repertoire. Complementation of bone marrow progenitors from the patient with the BLNK gene and transplantation into NOD/SCID/?cko mice allowed the complete restoration of B-cell differentiation and a normal usage of the IgV? genes.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582315","annotations":[{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.813363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.762575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.754053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.619792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.61704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.368227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Biochemical cascade","weight":0.347966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_cascade"},{"name":"B-cell linker","weight":0.208017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_linker"},{"name":"Complementation (genetics)","weight":0.166665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Transition (genetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell cycle checkpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_checkpoint"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Hypogammaglobulinemia","weight":0.0104985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogammaglobulinemia"}]}
