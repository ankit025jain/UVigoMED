{"id":74234,"title":"DNA polymerase ? and its roles in genome stability.","abstract":"DNA Polymerase Epsilon (Pol ?) is one of three DNA Polymerases (along with Pol ? and Pol ?) required for nuclear DNA replication in eukaryotes. Pol ? is comprised of four subunits, the largest of which is encoded by the POLE gene and contains the catalytic polymerase and exonuclease activities. The 3'-5' exonuclease proofreading activity is able to correct DNA synthesis errors and helps protect against genome instability. Recent cancer genome sequencing efforts have shown that 3% of colorectal and 7% of endometrial cancers contain mutations within the exonuclease domain of POLE and are associated with significantly elevated levels of single nucleotide substitutions (15-500 per Mb) and microsatellite stability. POLE mutations have also been found in other tumor types, though at lower frequency, suggesting roles in tumorigenesis more broadly in different tissue types. In addition to its proofreading activity, Pol ? contributes to genome stability through multiple mechanisms that are discussed in this review.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861832","annotations":[{"name":"Exonuclease","weight":0.895355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exonuclease"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.807743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Eukaryote","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Proofreading (biology)","weight":0.784048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading_(biology)"},{"name":"Nuclear DNA","weight":0.77631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_DNA"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Catalysis","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Point mutation","weight":0.731671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_mutation"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.70438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"DNA synthesis","weight":0.684517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_synthesis"},{"name":"Full genome sequencing","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_genome_sequencing"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.565245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Megabase","weight":0.528717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabase"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.295209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.282271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
