{"id":63980,"title":"Prediction of adverse events during intensive induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia or high-grade myelodysplastic syndromes.","abstract":"Intensive chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is associated with significant treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Herein, we investigate how pretreatment characteristics relate to early adverse outcomes in such patients, studying 205 consecutive individuals receiving curative-intent induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline (\"7 + 3\"; n?= 175) or a \"7 + 3\"-like regimen (n?=?30). Among the entire cohort, baseline grade 4 neutropenia (i.e., absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/ÂµL) was associated with development of fever (P?=?0.04), documented infection (P < 0.0001), and bacteremia (P = 0.002) but not requirement for intensive care unit-level care; after exclusion of the 30 patients who received \"7?+?3\"-like induction, baseline grade 4 neutropenia remained associated with documented infection (P < 0.0001) and bacteremia (P = 0.0005). Among patients achieving a complete remission with the initial treatment cycle, grade 4 neutropenia was associated with delayed neutrophil count recovery (P < 0.0001). Low monocyte and lymphocyte counts at baseline were similarly associated with increased risk of documented infection or bacteremia. After adjustment for age, gender, disease type, cytogenetic/molecular risk, and performance status, the risk of fever, documented infection, or bacteremia was 1.87 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-3.34; P=0.04)-fold, 4.95 (2.20-11.16; P<0.001)-fold, and 3.14 (0.99-9.98; P=0.05)-fold higher in patients with initial grade 4 neutropenia. Together, our studies identify severe baseline neutropenia as a risk factor for infection-associated adverse events after induction chemotherapy and may provide the rationale for the risk-adapted testing of myeloid growth factor support in this high-risk AML/MDS patient subset.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24382796","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.892448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Anthracycline","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracycline"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.767585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.760685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.688611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.667055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.614201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.539969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Absolute neutrophil count","weight":0.271491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_neutrophil_count"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Morphogenesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
