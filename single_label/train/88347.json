{"id":88347,"title":"Median nerve injury and repair.","abstract":"Median nerve injuries in the forearm are reasonably common and can lead to devastating functional sequelae for the hand if they are not managed in a timely and appropriate fashion. Most nerve lacerations should be repaired soon after injury, and current widespread application of microsurgical techniques should lead to reasonable results in most individuals. Despite these advances, many patients do not have ideal outcomes from injuries to the median nerve and are often left with permanent sequelae. This article will discuss current techniques in the management of median nerve injuries, with the goal of preventing or alleviating the potential negative sequelae of these injuries.
