{"id":56488,"title":"Spontaneous expulsion of lacrimal gland ductule stones by eyelid squeezing: a rare event.","abstract":"To report a rare case of lacrimal gland ductule stones.Case report.A 12-year-old female patient presented with pain, redness and swelling in the superotemporal fornix of the left eye of 1-week duration. She had experienced four similar episodes over a period of 2 years. Clinical evaluation revealed a mass adjacent to the lacrimal gland and some stone edges protruding through the lacrimal gland ductules. During preparation for their mechanical removal, a spontaneous expulsion of stones occurred. Microbiological examination of stones did not show any microorganism or nidus such as cilia. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed the stones to be composed of calcium carbonate 90% and magnesium hydrogen phosphates 10%. After spontaneous expulsion, the condition subsided without any complications.Lacrimal gland stones represent a very rare clinical entity and this should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent nonspecific conjunctivitis and dacryoadenitis.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678871","annotations":[{"name":"Calcium carbonate","weight":0.959338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Cilium","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Infrared spectroscopy","weight":0.675106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.674499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.67277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.666363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.651253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.475957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.474518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.452305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.276865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Carbonate","weight":0.247594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.246458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.230725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.212183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Conjunctivitis","weight":0.116667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0651226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Microbiology","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiology"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fourier transform","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Phase transition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
