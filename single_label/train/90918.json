{"id":90918,"title":"Routine follow-up cranial computed tomography for deeply sedated, intubated, and ventilated multiple trauma patients with suspected severe head injury.","abstract":"Missed or delayed detection of progressive neuronal damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI) may have negative impact on the outcome. We investigated whether routine follow-up CT is beneficial in sedated and mechanically ventilated trauma patients.The study design is a retrospective chart review. A routine follow-up cCT was performed 6 hours after the admission scan. We defined 2 groups of patients, group I: patients with equal or recurrent pathologies and group II: patients with new findings or progression of known pathologies.A progression of intracranial injury was found in 63 patients (42%) and 18 patients (12%) had new findings in cCT 2 (group II). In group II a change in therapy was found in 44 out of 81 patients (54%). 55 patients with progression or new findings on the second cCT had no clinical signs of neurological deterioration. Of those 24 patients (44%) had therapeutic consequences due to the results of the follow-up cCT.We found new diagnosis or progression of intracranial pathology in 54% of the patients. In 54% of patients with new findings and progression of pathology, therapy was changed due to the results of follow-up cCT. In trauma patients who are sedated and ventilated for different reasons a routine follow-up CT is beneficial.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563862","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.862193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Mechanical ventilation","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.707618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Intubation","weight":0.679997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intubation"},{"name":"Sedation","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.641068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Medical ventilator","weight":0.48264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.419135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.399803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.184096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0320572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
