{"id":60978,"title":"Successful treatment of Chronic Myelogenic Leukemia (CML) with imatinib after renal transplantation.","abstract":"Chronic Myelogenic Leukemia (CML) is a rare malignant disorder after solid organ transplantation, especially in renal transplant recipients. Imatinib Mesylate is currently approved as first line treatment of CML. Most reports on CML are from kidney recipients who received azathioprineÂ  in combination with cyclosporine and prednisolone as immunosuppressive therapy. We report a case with CML who was treated with Mycophenolate Mofetil.
