{"id":61127,"title":"CT-guided needle biopsy performed with modified coaxial technique in patients with refractory or recurrent lymphomas.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of computed tomography (CT)-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) performed by modified coaxial technique as an alternative tool to surgical biopsy in patients with refractory or recurrent lymphomas. Between May 2005 and May 2012, 57 CT-guided CNB of deep lesions were performed in patients with a previous diagnosis of lymphoma and suspected for refractory or recurrent disease. A modified coaxial technique was used in all cases and multiple samples were obtained for histological and immunohistochemical studies. A diagnosis of lymphoma with specification of subtype according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification was established in 30/57 cases (52.6 %). The previous diagnosis of lymphoma was confirmed in 27/57 patients (47.4 %), whereas histological progression in 3/57 (5.3 %) and other malignant neoplasms in 17/57 (29.8 %) were found. Lymphoma without subtype specification was diagnosed in 6/57 (10.5 %), and no conclusive diagnosis could be established in 4/57 cases (7 %). Overall diagnostic accuracy was 82.5 %. In patients with a final diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, accuracy was 75 %. No complications occurred. Percutaneous CT-guided CNB is a safe, effective and reliable tool in the management of patients with refractory or recurrent lymphomas without superficial lymphadenopathy and can be considered as alternative to surgical sampling.
