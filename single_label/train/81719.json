{"id":81719,"title":"Self-rated oral health and oral health-related factors: the role of social inequality.","abstract":"The reasons why social inequality is associated with oral health outcomes is poorly understood. This study investigated whether stratification by different measures of socio-economic status (SES) helped elucidate these associations.Cross-sectional survey data were used from Australia's 2004-06 National Survey of Adult Oral Health. The outcome variable was poor self-rated oral health. Explanatory variables comprised five domains: demographic, economic, general health behaviour, oral health-related quality of life and perceived need for dental care. These explanatory variables were each stratified by three measures of SES: education, income and occupation.The overall proportion of adults reporting fair or poor oral health was 17.0% (95% CI 16.1, 18.0). Of these, a higher proportion were older, Indigenous, non-Australian born, poorly educated, annual income <$20?000, unemployed, eligible for public dental care, smoked tobacco, avoided food in the last 12 months, experienced discomfort with their dental appearance, experienced toothache or reported a need for dental care. In stratified analyses, a greater number of differences persisted in the oral health impairment and perceived need for dental care domains.Irrespective of the SES measure used, more associations between self-rated oral health and dental-specific factors were observed than associations between self-rated oral health and general factors.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861399","annotations":[{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.878577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.808981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.797107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.725719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.666255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.664861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.515908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.477899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.470625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.42868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.399629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.253823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.163159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Dependent and independent variables","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Smoking (cooking)","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"},{"name":"Indigenous Australians","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Toothache","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothache"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
