{"id":25190,"title":"Mortality while waiting for aortic valve replacement.","abstract":"Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with high mortality without intervention. The impact of waiting time for aortic valve replacement (AVR), either surgically or transcatheter, has not been reported.From January 2008 to December 2012, we identified 1,005 patients with severe symptomatic AS. AVR was recommended for 823 patients (82%). Of these 823 patients, 721 (87.6%) underwent AVR. We modeled overall survival (OS) since AVR recommendation or intervention date using Cox and multistate models.Overall, the median (first, third quartiles) waiting time until operation was 2.9 (1.3, 5.1) weeks. Mortality at these times was lower (p<0.001) in the AVR group (1.2%, 0.3%, 1.7%, respectively) than in the group that did not receive AVR (6.9%, 2.9%, 9.8%, respectively). Thirty-day mortality after AVR was 3.9% (3.2% surgical AVR [SAVR] and 7.0% transcatheter AVR [TAVR]). In patients receiving AVR, waiting time was not associated with increased mortality. Mortality while waiting for AVR was 3.7% and 11.6% at 1 and 6 months, respectively. Mortality while waiting for TAVR was higher than that for SAVR (1-, 6-, and 12-month mortality of 3.7%, 8.0%, and 9.6%, respectively, in SAVR group and 3.8%, 23.3%, and 27.5%, respectively, in TAVR group; p<0.001).Some patients do not receive AVR in a timely fashion, and prolonged waiting time for AVR is associated with mortality greater than the AVR operative mortality. Although waiting time was not associated with poor operative outcomes after AVR, many patients may die while waiting for AVR. Patients should receive AVR on a semiurgent, not elective, basis.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25240781","annotations":[{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.864676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.744594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aortic valve stenosis","weight":0.718575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_stenosis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.648144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.499048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Aortic valve replacement","weight":0.253699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve_replacement"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.0496898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"823","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/823"},{"name":"721","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/721"},{"name":"2008 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Territorial Army (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"5.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"GCE Advanced Level","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0153226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Atmel AVR","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR"},{"name":"Election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Invasion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
