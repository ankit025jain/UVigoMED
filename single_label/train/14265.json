{"id":14265,"title":"Time-dependent effect of combination therapy with erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in a mouse model of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.","abstract":"Erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are likely to play broad roles in the brain. We investigated the effects of combination therapy with EPO and G-CSF in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury during the acute, subacute, and chronic phases. A total of 79 C57BL/6 mice with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury were randomly assigned acute (days 1-5), subacute (days 11-15) and chronic (days 28-32) groups. All of them were treated with G-CSF (250 ?g/kg) and EPO (5000 U/kg) or saline daily for 5 consecutive days. Behavioral assessments and immunohistochemistry for angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and astrogliosis were performed with an 8-week follow-up. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) was also measured by Western blot analysis. The results showed that the combination therapy with EPO and G-CSF in the acute phase significantly improved rotarod performance and forelimb-use symmetry compared to the other groups, while subacute EPO and G-CSF therapy exhibited a modest improvement compared with the chronic saline controls. The acute treatment significantly increased the density of CD31(+) (PECAM-1) and ?-smooth muscle actin(+) vessels in the frontal cortex and striatum, increased BrdU(+)/PSA-NCAM(+) neurogenesis in the subventricular zone, and decreased astroglial density in the striatum. Furthermore, acute treatment significantly increased the HIF-1 expression in the cytosol and nucleus, whereas chronic treatment did not change the HIF-1 expression, consistent with the behavioral outcomes. These results indicate that the induction of HIF-1 expression by combination therapy with EPO and G-CSF synergistically enhances not only behavioral function but also neurogenesis and angiogenesis while decreasing the astroglial response in a time-dependent manner.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435306","annotations":[{"name":"Erythropoietin","weight":0.916965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Neurogenesis","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.801894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.746783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Striatum","weight":0.740786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.720731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.708685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Astrocyte","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Frontal lobe","weight":0.627748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.504888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Subventricular zone","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subventricular_zone"},{"name":"Astrogliosis","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrogliosis"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.386617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.363573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.344884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.221945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.183484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.101583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"CD31","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD31"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"HIF1A","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
