{"id":20513,"title":"APO?4 is associated with enhanced in vivo innate immune responses in human subjects.","abstract":"The genetic determinants of the human innate immune response are poorly understood. Apolipoprotein (Apo) E, a lipid-trafficking protein that affects inflammation, has well-described wild-type (?3) and disease-associated (?2 and ?4) alleles, but its connection to human innate immunity is undefined.We sought to define the relationship of APO?4 to the human innate immune response.We evaluated APO?4 in several functional models of the human innate immune response, including intravenous LPS challenge in human subjects, and assessed APO?4 association to organ injury in patients with severe sepsis, a disease driven by dysregulated innate immunity.Whole blood from healthy APO?3/APO?4 volunteers induced higher cytokine levels on exÂ vivo stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, or TLR5 ligands than blood from APO?3/APO?3 patients, whereas TLR7/8 responses were similar. This was associated with increased lipid rafts in APO?3/APO?4 monocytes. By contrast, APO?3/APO?3 and APO?3/APO?4 serum neutralized LPS equivalently and supported similar LPS responses in Apoe-deficient macrophages, arguing against a differential role for secretory APOE4 protein. After intravenous LPS, APO?3/APO?4 patients had higher hyperthermia and plasma TNF-? levels and earlier plasma IL-6 than APO?3/APO?3 patients. APOE4-targeted replacement mice displayed enhanced hypothermia, plasma cytokines, and hepatic injury and altered splenic lymphocyte apoptosis after systemic LPS compared with APOE3 counterparts. In a cohort of 828 patients with severe sepsis, APO?4 was associated with increased coagulation system failure among European American patients.APO?4 is a determinant of the human innate immune response to multiple TLR ligands and associates with altered patterns of organ injury in human sepsis.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
