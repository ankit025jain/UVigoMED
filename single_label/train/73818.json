{"id":73818,"title":"Kaliziri extract upregulates tyrosinase, TRP-1, TRP-2 and MITF expression in murine B16 melanoma cells.","abstract":"Kaliziri extract (KZE) is a traditional Uyghur medicine (TUM), used by traditional hospitals in China as an injection for treatment of vitiligo for more than 30 years. Clinical application has shown that this medicine has obvious therapeutic effects. However, its phytochemical analysis and mechanism have not been examined.KZE was extracted from seeds of Kaliziri [Vernonia anthelmintica (L.) Willd.] in ethanol-water (80:20, v/v), its components were identified by LC-MS/MS, and the signaling pathway of melanin synthesis in KZE treated murine B16 melanoma cells was examined by western blotting.Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the main components of KZE are flavonoids. KZE increased the tyrosinase activity and melanin content in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 5-40 ?g/ml, and treatment with 20 ?g/ml of KZE enhanced the expression of tyrosinase in B16 cells in a time-dependent manner.KZE induced melanogenesis by increasing the expression of TYR, TRP-1, TRP-2 and MITF in B16 cells.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884952","annotations":[{"name":"Melanin","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin"},{"name":"Tyrosinase","weight":0.889968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosinase"},{"name":"Vitiligo","weight":0.84505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Melanocyte","weight":0.647649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Flavonoid","weight":0.622812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Phytochemical","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochemical"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.351051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.270433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.261574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.213223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.161683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Uyghur people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Middle Low German","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Low_German"},{"name":"Vernonia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernonia"},{"name":"Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphthalmia-associated_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"List of hospitals in China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hospitals_in_China"},{"name":"Transient receptor potential channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_channel"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
