{"id":91933,"title":"[Effects of moxibustion at Shenque (CV8) on gastrointestinal function in rats undergoing gastric perforation repair].","abstract":"To assess the effects of moxibustion at Shenque (CV8) in promoting gastrointestinal function recovery in rats following gastric perforation repair and explore the underlying mechanism.Thirty male SD rats with glacial acetic acid-induced gastric perforation underwent surgical repair of the perforation. The rats were then randomized 8 days later into model group (n=10), domperidone group (n=10), and moxibustion group(n=10) and treated with physiologic saline, domperidone suspension, and moxibustion at Shenque (CV8), respectively. Gastric antral myoelectric activities of the rats were observed and peripheral blood levels of TNF-?, IL-6, and T lymphocyte subpopulation were determined.Gastric antral myoelectric activities in rats receiving moxibustion were stronger than those in the model group (P<0.05) but comparable with those in domperidone group (P>0.05). TNF-? and IL-6 level were decreased significantly and T lymphocyte subpopulations increased significantly in moxibustion group compared with those in the model and domperidone groups (P<0.05).Moxibustion at Shenque (CV8) can promote the recovery of gastrointestinal functions in rats undergoing gastric perforation repair possibly by enhancing gastrointestinal electric activity, suppressing inflammation, and improving the cellular immune function, and can therefore serve as a simple and effective adjuvant therapy during the perioperative period.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463133","annotations":[{"name":"T cell","weight":0.909438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.86647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.714233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.69807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.619871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.453533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.419468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal perforation","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_perforation"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.342331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.308774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.159256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.149946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Domperidone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domperidone"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Perforation","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0229109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
