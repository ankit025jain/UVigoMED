{"id":77403,"title":"Psoriasis predisposition and occupational triggering factors in the appraisal of occupational medical expertises.","abstract":"Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with a genetic background. Local psoriatic changes can be triggered by exogenous mechanical or irritant factors. Causative occupational factors have to be distinguished from the spontaneous course of psoriasis in occupational medical evaluations. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the medico-legal grounds for a homogenous assessment.The presented recommendations were developed in a working group for Occupational and Environmental Dermatology (ABD) and the German contact dermatitis group (DKG) of the German Dermatologic Society (DDG) based on the German medico-legal framework.Causality between the insured activity and the appearance of psoriasis is a prerequisite for the recognition of the occupational nature of the disease. This is the case if the occupational activity is the exclusive or a legally essential contributing factor either for first manifestation or aggravation of the disease. A connection must be denied if everyday events are sufficient to trigger the psoriasis. From 1995 to 2010, 130 cases of psoriasis have been recognized as occupationally related by the German statutory accident insurance.The appraisal of psoriatic disease in the occupational medical evaluation is subject to the case assessment of the expert witness. In this position paper we present recommendations for a homologous basis for diagnosis, causality assessment, estimation of reduction in earning capacity and rehabilitation of occupational psoriasis.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24889306","annotations":[{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.669015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.493715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.441749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.277566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.253446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.240812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.228526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Expert witness","weight":0.221708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.119685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Witness","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0425622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Statute","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Medical law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_law"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"}]}
