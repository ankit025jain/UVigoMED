{"id":87625,"title":"Trauma remains a surgical disease from cradle to grave.","abstract":"A dramatic rise in nonoperative management of many blunt and some penetrating traumatic injuries has occurred during the past four decades. This trend has lead some to suggest that trauma is no longer a surgical disease. We questioned what role the trauma surgeon plays in the care of the injured patient. We hypothesized that surgical intervention and judgment are still often required in both injured children and adults.We queried the trauma databases at two academic Level I trauma centers (adult and pediatric) for all patients admitted for trauma who underwent an inpatient operation between July 1, 2009, and June, 31, 2013, as well as those patients with \"potentially operative injury.\" Potentially operative injury was defined as the presence of liver or splenic laceration of any grade or hemothorax in patients who did not undergo an inpatient operation. For analysis, we divided patients into groups based on age. We differentiated infants (0-1 years), toddlers (2-5 years), school-aged children (6-12 years), adolescents (13-15 years), young adults (16-21 years), adults (22-40 years), middle-aged adults (41-50 years), late middle-aged adults (51-64 years), and elderly (>65 years). Data collected included demographic information and number of operations performed in each patient based on surgical service (neurosurgery, trauma surgery, orthopedic surgery, and other surgical services).During this 4-year study period, 11,611 patients were admitted to the trauma service, 6,334 (54.6%) of whom underwent an inpatient operation and another 492 (4.2%) of whom had potentially operative injury. Across all age groups, orthopedic procedures accounted for the greatest percentage of inpatient procedures (>70% of inpatient operations performed). Neurosurgical intervention accounted for less than 10% of inpatient surgical interventions, and general surgical procedures performed by trauma surgeons accounted for 17.1%. More than half of all general surgical procedures were performed in the patients who required a hospital stay of more than 7 days (67.2% among all patients).More than half of patients admitted following traumatic injury require operative intervention. This rate remains stable across all age groups. Our data emphasize the continued need for surgeons to stay engaged in the care of the trauma patient, particularly those most critically injured patients who will require prolonged hospital stay.Epidemiologic study, level III.
