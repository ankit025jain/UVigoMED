{"id":14644,"title":"Daptomycin is effective as antibiotic-lock therapy in a model of Staphylococcus aureus catheter-related infection.","abstract":"The effectiveness of daptomycin versus vancomycin for treating experimental methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) catheter-related infection by antibiotic-lock technique was assessed.One MSSA strain and one clinical MRSA isolate were used. A preliminary in vitro study determined the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of vancomycin and daptomycin. An intravenous catheter was implanted in New Zealand white rabbits. Infection was induced by 24 h locking the catheter with 0.3 mL of broth culture containing MSSA or MRSA. The 24 h of antibiotic-lock treatment groups were: control, vancomycin 10 mg/mL, daptomycin 5 mg/mL and daptomycin 50 mg/mL.Daptomycin showed greater in vitro activity than vancomycin against biofilm bacteria (MBECs of vancomycin and daptomycin for MSSA, >2000 mg/L and 7 mg/L; MRSA, >2000 mg/L and 15 mg/L). Daptomycin 5 mg/mL achieved significant reductions relative to vancomycin 10 mg/mL in log10 cfu recovered from catheter tips for both strains (P < 0.05). Only daptomycin 50 mg/mL achieved negative catheter tip cultures (up to 75% in MSSA and 85% in MRSA, P < 0.05), showing the greatest median log10 cfu reduction compared to controls (6.07 in MSSA and 6.59 in MRSA, P < 0.05).Daptomycin 50 mg/mL showed the highest activity against both strains biofilms.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412247","annotations":[{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.493114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.418818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Daptomycin","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daptomycin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"New Zealand rabbit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_rabbit"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Millilitre","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millilitre"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"},{"name":"Colony-forming unit","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony-forming_unit"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Common logarithm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm"},{"name":"Angora rabbit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angora_rabbit"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Peripheral venous catheter","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_venous_catheter"}]}
