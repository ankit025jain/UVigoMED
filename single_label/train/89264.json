{"id":89264,"title":"[What do we need to know about the burn injuries? Pathophysiology, aetiology and effects].","abstract":"Burn injuries are a major public health problem worldwide, because they are very common. They are usually produced in domestic or work environments, although it is not unusual that they might be caused by traffic accidents or intentionally (self-injured or assaults on the people). These injuries do not attract much attention but if they are not treated properly, they can lead to serious systemic complications which can sometimes cause the death of the patient. In the last few years, the therapeutic approach of the burned patient has significantly improved due to an early correct initial valuation, which is used to design an effective nursing care plan and it determines the prescription of a suitable medical treatment according to the characteristics and the severity of the burn. The aim of this chapter is to explain some general aspects about the aetiology and pathology of burn injuries and their systemic effects, because the medical and nursing staff should know these aspects to make an adequate initial valuation. They should recognize the aetiology of the burn, its depth and area, its severity and its systemic complications to act properly in the initial phase of the treatment, because these preliminary actions are essential in the prognosis and evolution of the burns.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738168","annotations":[{"name":"Burn","weight":0.907611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.805045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.70317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.582994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.567093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.43028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.414064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Nursing care plan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_care_plan"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Value theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_theory"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
