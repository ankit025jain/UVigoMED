{"id":87679,"title":"[Over-articular external fixator combined with limited internal fixation for the treatment of high-energy Pilon fractures].","abstract":"To study clinical effects of the over-articular external fixator combined with limited internal fixation for the treatment of Pilon fractures caused by high energy.From September 2003 to April 2011, 36 patients with Pilon fractures caused by high energy were treated with the over-articular external fixator combined with limited internal fixator. There were 25 males and 11 females, ranging in age from 16 to 72 years old,with an average of 38 years old. The diagnoses of all patients were determined by conventional X-ray examination or three-dimensional spiral CT examination. The AOFAS scoring criteria was used to evaluate the therapeutic effects. The patients with comminuted fractures were treated with screw or Kirschner wire fixation without uncovering periost so as to enhance stability between fracture end and bone blocks,followed by the fixation with over-articular external fixators.All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 4 to 27 months, with an average of 13 months. Thirty-two patients got wound healing at the first stage. And the bone union duration ranged from 2 to 6 months, with a mean of 3 months. According to the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot subjective scoring standard, 13 patients got an excellent result, 20 good and 3 fair, with an score of 88.2 +/- 3.6. Twelve patients had infections at pinhole, 5 patients had pinhole pain. One patient had the fixator broken induced by over loading, who was cured after treatment. There were no complications such as nerve or vascular injuries, or osteomyelitis.The over-articular external fixation combined with limited internal fixation for the treatment of Pilon fractures caused by high energy is an ideal method, which has such advantages as reliable fixation, simple operation, coincidence with principles of biomechanical fixation, and benefit for fracture healing.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029844","annotations":[{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.782266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.779242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.648946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.573145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.332161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.264844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.180524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Bone healing","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_healing"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Kirschner wire","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirschner_wire"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Particle physics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Spiral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Marc Kirschner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Kirschner"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Coincidence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
