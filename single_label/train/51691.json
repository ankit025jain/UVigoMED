{"id":51691,"title":"RBP4 gene variants are associated with insulin resistance in women with previous gestational diabetes.","abstract":"This study aimed to examine possible genetic effects of some retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In addition, the SNPs were examined for their possible association with insulin resistance at 6 weeks after delivery.This was a prospective study of 100 women with GDM and 100 participants with normal gestation who were evaluated at gestational week 30 and 6 weeks postpartum. Three SNPs of RBP4 (rs3758539, rs116736522, and rs34571439) were genotyped using TaqMan assay. The genotype distributions between GDM patients and normal controls were analyzed using logistic regression models. In addition, differences in clinical characteristics among subjects grouped by genotype were assessed using the analysis of covariance test.The frequencies of the rare alleles were not significantly different between GDM patients and controls. However, we identified two variants rs3758539 and rs34571439 associated with insulin levels and insulin resistance in women with previous GDM.Noncoding SNPs of the RBP4 gene are not associated with GDM, but two SNPs showed associations with insulin resistance and insulin levels in women with prior GDM. Additional studies with increased sample size will be necessary in other GDM cohorts.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24665145","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.775809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.750072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.713286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.665838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.562853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.430637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Covariance","weight":0.330124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.231422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.171192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.171152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.157573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Retinol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinol"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Analysis of covariance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Gestational diabetes","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
