{"id":82444,"title":"Oral health condition and hygiene habits among adult patients with respect to their level of dental anxiety.","abstract":"Dental anxiety is a common phenomenon influencing the relationship between a patient and a doctor as well as the course of treatment. The aim of the study was to assess the oral health status and hygiene habits among adult patients with respect to their level of dental anxiety.117 consecutive adult patients referred to the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Paedodontics of Wroclaw Medical University were included in the study. There were 58 women (49.57%) and 59 men (50.43%). The mean age of the patients was 36.57 Â± 16.76 years. The level of dental anxiety was assessed using the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS). To evaluate dental health status and oral hygiene, the following indices were used: total number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMF/T) as well as surfaces (DMF/S), approximal plaque index (API), oral hygiene index (OHI), debris index (DI) and calculus index (CI).The study revealed that the patients with high MDAS presented a higher calculus index (CI). There was a negative correlation between a high level of dental anxiety measured by MDAS and the number of filled teeth (F/T) as well as the number of filled dental surfaces (F/S). There was no significant correlation between dental anxiety as measured with the MDAS and age, gender or level of education; however, smokers had a significantly higher anxiety level than non-smokers.Dental anxiety has a negative influence on oral health status; the higher the level of dental anxiety, the lower the number of filled teeth and the higher the calculus index. Poor dental and periodontal health may have many somatic as well as psychosocial consequences, both of which lower the quality of life of the patient.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624394","annotations":[{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.881791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.724672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.719464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.557294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.543451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.470534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.399254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.359623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Wroclaw","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wroclaw"},{"name":"Application programming interface","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"},{"name":"Infinitesimal calculus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus"},{"name":"Financial Times","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times"},{"name":"Negative number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_number"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Space debris","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris"},{"name":"Ferrovie dello Stato","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrovie_dello_Stato"},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"Pediatric dentistry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_dentistry"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Discovery Investigations","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Investigations"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"}]}
