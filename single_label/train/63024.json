{"id":63024,"title":"Fc? receptor IIIA genotype is associated with rituximab response in antimyelin-associated glycoprotein neuropathy.","abstract":"Treatment with anti-B cell antibody rituximab may ameliorate the disease course in a subgroup of patients with polyneuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy. Polymorphisms of leukocyte IgG receptors (Fc?R) that influence efficiency of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity determine rituximab efficacy in patients with lymphoma and autoimmune disease.To investigate the association of Fc?RIIA and Fc?RIIIA polymorphisms with the response to rituximab treatment in a cohort of patients with polyneuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy (PNP-IgM) with and without antimyelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies.We determined Fc?RIIA-R/H131 and Fc?RIIIA-V/F158 genotypes in 27 patients with PNP-IgM using allele-specific PCR and Sanger sequencing.The Fc?RIIIA-V/V158 genotype was associated with functional improvement (p=0.02) after 1 year.Fc?RIIIA polymorphisms are potential biomarkers for response to rituximab treatment in polyneuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487381","annotations":[{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.912788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Fc receptor","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fc_receptor"},{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.830091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.756407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.403008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.348425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Polyneuropathy","weight":0.282819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.171631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Fragment crystallizable region","weight":0.169901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"}]}
