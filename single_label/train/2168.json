{"id":2168,"title":"Safety of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with acute cholecystitis undergoing antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy: a single-institution experience.","abstract":"Early cholecystectomy is recommended for patients with acute cholecystitis, particularly when less than 72 hours have passed since symptom onset. The safety of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients receiving anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents is unclear. We retrospectively analyzed the safety of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with acute cholecystitis undergoing antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy.Between 2005 and 2012, a total of 239 patients were diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, 183 of whom underwent early laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We compared the clinical features and surgical outcomes of 21 patients undergoing antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy with those of 162 patients not undergoing antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy.Of the 21 patients, 15 patients took aspirin and four took clopidogrel sulfate. Three patients received dual therapy with two agents. The distributions of the severity of acute cholecystitis, a past history of abdominal operations, body mass index, blood test results, operation time, and blood loss were not significant between the two groups. Neither conversion to open surgery nor bleeding-related complications occurred in the patients undergoing antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy.Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for selected patients with acute cholecystitis undergoing antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy is feasible and safe.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436333","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.862063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.79917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.74659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.72001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.652113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.450122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.443471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.360578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Clopidogrel","weight":0.335458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopidogrel"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.312293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"239","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/239"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"}]}
