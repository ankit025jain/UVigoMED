{"id":89847,"title":"Technical tip: tightrope fixation of neer type II distal clavicle fracture supported by a case series.","abstract":"We present a case series of 3 patients who underwent a novel technique of tight rope fixation for Neer type II distal clavicle fracture.2-3 cm incision was made lateral to the fracture site moving inferomedially. Part of the distal end of clavicle was exposed close to fracture site and further dissection was carried out to reveal the coracoid process. Tight rope fixation of the distal ends of clavicle and coracoid was performed to achieve satisfactory fracture reduction on x-ray.4 weeks of sling with gentle pendulum movement were followed by active shoulder movement exercises. Radiographic union was reached at 6 weeks' time, while the patients achieved proper shoulder functionality 3 months following the operation.Neer type II distal clavicle fractures are characterized by disruption of the coracoclavicular ligament with wide proximal fragment displacement. Overall, type II distal clavicle fractures have a 20-30% nonunion rate if treated non-surgically. Various techniques have been described for the treatment of these fractures, including hook plate and nailing. Tight rope fixation provides proper apposition of the fracture fragments for union by maintaining a reduced coracoclavicular interval.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675020","annotations":[{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Clavicle fracture","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle_fracture"},{"name":"Coracoid","weight":0.79756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoid"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.785244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.726118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.717882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.574758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.523998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Reduction (orthopedic surgery)","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(orthopedic_surgery)"},{"name":"Coracoid process","weight":0.310367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoid_process"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Coracoclavicular ligament","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoclavicular_ligament"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Bandage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage"},{"name":"Rope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope"},{"name":"Tightrope walking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tightrope_walking"},{"name":"Hook (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(music)"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"23-centimeter band","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23-centimeter_band"},{"name":"Neer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neer"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Eye","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pendulum","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum"}]}
