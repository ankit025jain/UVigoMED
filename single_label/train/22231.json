Physical examination revealed scaly, fissured, erythematous plaques around her fingernails (Figure 1). Underneath the acrylic artificial nails that she had been wearing for 6 weeks, onycholysis and nail bed hyperkeratosis were evident. Oral terbinafine and amorolfine nail polish were prescribed by the general practitioner but had no clinical benefit.
