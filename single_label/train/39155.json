The patients were operated for calculous cholecystitis and DC stages II - III. The changes revealed witnessed about more expressed degradation of collagen and affection of the elastin components of connective tissue. On background of the pathological process progress in palmar aponeurosis in patients, suffering DC, a content of oxyproline have enhanced trustworthy in urine and reduced in tissue of a changed palmar aponeurosis.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252418","annotations":[{"name":"Elastin","weight":0.902289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastin"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.546738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Aponeurosis","weight":0.279468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aponeurosis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.232822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cholecystitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis"},{"name":"Calculus (medicine)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"},{"name":"Palmar aponeurosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmar_aponeurosis"},{"name":"Direct current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Affection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"}]}
