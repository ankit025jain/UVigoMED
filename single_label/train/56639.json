{"id":56639,"title":"Endoscopic ultrasonic dacryocystorhinostomy for recurrent dacryocystitis following rhinoplasty.","abstract":"The lacrimal sac is the structure most vulnerable to injury when performing rhinoplastic osteotomies. When performed in a low lateral position or along the frontal process of the frontal-maxillary suture, osteotomies can potentially tear the medial canthal tendon and injure the underlying lacrimal sac, possibly resulting in dacryocystitis. In this case report, the authors discuss a case of dacryocystitis following primary rhinoplasty; this injury was repaired with endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) using a Sonopet ultrasonic bone aspirator (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan) at a single institution. This method achieved nasolacrimal duct patency, and the patient continued to be symptom-free at an 18-month follow-up. This is the first reported case of recurrent dacryocystitis following rhinoplasty as treated by endoscopic DCR.5.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24658062","annotations":[{"name":"Nasolacrimal duct","weight":0.871478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolacrimal_duct"},{"name":"Lacrimal sac","weight":0.596395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_sac"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.352588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.346988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Frontal bone","weight":0.17336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_bone"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.157879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0945173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Kalamazoo, Michigan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo,_Michigan"},{"name":"Rhinoplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoplasty"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Aspirator","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirator"},{"name":"Dacryocystorhinostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacryocystorhinostomy"},{"name":"Dacryocystitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacryocystitis"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Canthus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canthus"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Lacrimal bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_bone"},{"name":"Stryker","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stryker"},{"name":"Michigan","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Conservation_and_Recreation_(Massachusetts)"},{"name":"Huntsville Unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville_Unit"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"}]}
