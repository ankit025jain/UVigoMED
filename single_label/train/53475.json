{"id":53475,"title":"Thrombin generation and platelet reactivity at hospital discharge and 6-month outcome after the acute coronary syndrome in diabetic and nondiabetic patients.","abstract":"Increased plasma thrombogenesis and blood platelet reactivity are associated with a worse outcome in patients with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this study was to test the clinical utility of combining a thrombin generation test and platelet aggregation in predicting future ischemic events after ACS.The study included patients hospitalized due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation. Blood for platelet aggregation and thrombin generation was collected at hospital discharge. We performed whole-blood platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid (AA), collagen, adenosine diphosphate and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) as agonists and the thrombin generation test using a fluorescence method. Patients were followed for up to 6 months. The combined end point of the study consisted of death, stroke, myocardial infarction or repeated target vessel revascularization.The study enrolled 161 patients. The end point occurred in 30 patients (18.6%). Thrombin generation showed a significantly prolonged lag time, time to thrombogram peak and start of the tail of the thrombogram in diabetic patients who reached the study end point but not in nondiabetics. End point occurrence was not connected with platelet reactivity at hospital discharge in the whole group. In the diabetic subgroup, increased platelet aggregation induced with AA and TRAP at hospital discharge was connected with a more frequent occurrence of the study end point.In diabetic patients after STEMI, thrombin generation measures as well as TRAP- and AA-induced platelet aggregation at hospital discharge are associated with an ensuing ischemic event during the 6-month follow-up.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24514756","annotations":[{"name":"Adenosine diphosphate","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Acute coronary syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_coronary_syndrome"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.832852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.826989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.799611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.777944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.765978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.638415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.499981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.466875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.431976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Adenosine","weight":0.421364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.338395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Platelet aggregation","weight":0.322193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_aggregation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.306296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Pyrophosphate","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.0575759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"American Cancer Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"}]}
