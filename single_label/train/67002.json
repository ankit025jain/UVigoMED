{"id":67002,"title":"Assisted oocyte activation following ICSI fertilization failure.","abstract":"The capacity of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to permit almost any type of spermatozoa to fertilize oocytes has made it the most successful treatment for male factor infertility. Despite its high success rates, fertilization failure following ICSI still occurs in 1-3% of couples. Assisted oocyte activation (AOA) is being increasingly applied in human assisted reproduction to restore fertilization and pregnancy rates in couples with a history of ICSI fertilization failure. However, controversy still exists mainly because the artificial activating agents do not mimic precisely the initial physiological processes of mammalian oocyte activation, which has led to safety concerns. This review addresses the mechanism of human oocyte activation and the relatively rare phenomenon of fertilization failure after ICSI. Next, it describes the current diagnostic approaches and focuses on the application, efficiency and safety of AOA in human assisted reproduction.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656559","annotations":[{"name":"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Spermatozoon","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoon"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.472216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Mimicry","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0916205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0768603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pregnancy rate","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
