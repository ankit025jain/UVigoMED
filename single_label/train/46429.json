{"id":46429,"title":"Radial volumetric imaging breath-hold examination (VIBE) with k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) for dynamic gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI of the liver: advantages over Cartesian VIBE in the arterial phase.","abstract":"To compare radial volumetric imaging breath-hold examination with k-space weighted image contrast reconstruction (r-VIBE-KWIC) to Cartesian VIBE (c-VIBE) in arterial phase dynamic gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of the liver.We reviewed 53 consecutive DCE-MRI studies performed on a 3-T unit using c-VIBE and 53 consecutive cases performed using r-VIBE-KWIC with full-frame image subset (r-VIBEfull) and sub-frame image subsets (r-VIBEsub; temporal resolution, 2.5-3 s). All arterial phase images were scored by two readers on: (1) contrast-enhancement ratio (CER) in the abdominal aorta; (2) scan timing; (3) artefacts; (4) visualisation of the common, right, and left hepatic arteries.Mean abdominal aortic CERs for c-VIBE, r-VIBEfull, and r-VIBEsub were 3.2, 4.3 and 6.5, respectively. There were significant differences between each group (P?<?0.0001). The mean score for c-VIBE was significantly lower than that for r-VIBEfull and r-VIBEsub in all factors except for visualisation of the common hepatic artery (P?<?0.05). The mean score of all factors except for scan timing for r-VIBEsub was not significantly different from that for r-VIBEfull.Radial VIBE-KWIC provides higher image quality than c-VIBE, and r-VIBEsub features high temporal resolution without image degradation in arterial phase DCE-MRI.Radial VIBE-KWIC minimised artefact and produced high-quality and high-temporal-resolution images. Maximum abdominal aortic enhancement was observed on sub-frame images of r-VIBE-KWIC. Using r-VIBE-KWIC, optimal arterial phase images were obtained in over 90 %. Using r-VIBE-KWIC, visualisation of the hepatic arteries was improved. A two-reader study revealed r-VIBE-KWIC's advantages over Cartesian VIBE.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Digestive System
