{"id":90203,"title":"[Short-term effectiveness of reconstructive locked plate for treating sternoclavicular joint dislocation].","abstract":"To investigate the short-term effectiveness of reconstructive locked plate for treating sternoclavicular joint dislocation.Between February 2008 and February 2012, 11 patients with sternoclavicular joint dislocation were treated with reconstructive locked plate, and the clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. There were 7 males and 4 females, aged 30-55 years (mean, 44 years). The causes of injury included traffic accident in 8 cases and crashing in 3 cases. The disease duration ranged from 2 hours to 11 days (median, 6 days). All patients had anterior dislocation of sternoclavicular joint. According to the Grade system, there were 2 cases of type II and 9 cases of type III.All patients obtained healing of incisions by first intention after operation. There was no neurovascular injury. The X-ray films showed that satisfactory reduction of joint dislocation and stable internal fixation were obtained at 2 days after operation. All patients were followed up 9-24 months (mean, 16 months). According to the Rockwood criteria, the score was 10-15 (mean, 13.2); the results were excellent in 9 cases and good in 2 cases, with an excellent and good rate of 100% at 9 months after operation. No internal fixation failure or re-dislocation occurred. All internal fixators were removed at 9-15 months after operation. Both the stability and the functions of the shoulder joint were good.The reconstructive locked plate in treating sternoclavicular joint dislocation has the advantages of good stability and satisfactory reduction, and the patients can do functional exercises early and obtain good recovery of the shoulder joint function. The short-term effectiveness is satisfactory.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640363","annotations":[{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.330397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.294978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.109883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0777877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Sternoclavicular articulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternoclavicular_articulation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0173619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Fresco","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"1015","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1015"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"924","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/924"},{"name":"915","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/915"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Fixation (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(psychology)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Structural functionalism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_functionalism"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"}]}
