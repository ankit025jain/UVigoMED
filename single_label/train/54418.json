{"id":54418,"title":"[The modern concept of the regulatory role of peptides of the glyproline family in the correction of hemostasis system function during development of diabetes mellitus].","abstract":"The experimental data on the therapeutic and prophylactic antidiabetogenic effect of di-, tri-, and tetrapeptides of the glyproline family with the additional inclusion of arginine or leucine at different positions are presented. The results are obtained using two animal models: with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1), and persistent hyperglycemia similar to development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2) in humans. It is shown that repeated intranasal administration of Pro-Gly, Pro-Gly-Pro, Pro-Gly-Pro-Arg, Pro-Gly-Arg, Arg-Pro-Gly, Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro, Gly-Pro-Arg, Pro-Arg-Gly, Pro-Gly-Pro-Leu, Leu-Pro-Gly-Pro peptides to rats with hyperglycemia of different etiology led to the combined normoglycemic and anticoagulant effects in the blood plasma. The concept of the regulatory role of short proline-containing peptides, involving the universality of their action in the organism and directed towards the regulation of both hemostasis and insular systems in a variety of their physiological and clinical manifestations, was formulated.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459851","annotations":[{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Leucine","weight":0.75796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Prophylactic","weight":0.571713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylactic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.384824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.238395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Great Britain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0137282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
