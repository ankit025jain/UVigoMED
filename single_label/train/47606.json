{"id":47606,"title":"Bufalin attenuates the stage and metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma in nude mice.","abstract":"Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergo significant tumor growth and metastasis. Here, we investigated bufalin for treating HCC, which exhibits anti-tumor activities in many tumor cell lines.In our experiment, HCCLM3-R cells were injected into nude mice to form subcutaneous human HCC tumors that were implanted into the liver to establish orthotopic transplantation tumor models. Bufalin was injected intraperitoneally at 1 or 1.5 mg/kg. LY294002 (100 mg/kg), a potent inhibitor of Akt which reduced the levels of pAkt in HCCLM3 cell lines, was injected intraperitoneally into one group thrice weekly. The control was injected with an equal volume of saline. Morphological alterations were evaluated in the liver and lung by stereomicroscopy, the apoptotic rate was measured by TUNEL staining, and expression of AKT/GSK3?/?-catenin/E-cadherin signaling pathway-related proteins was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analysis.These results suggested that the sizes and qualities of orthotopic transplanted tumors as well as pulmonary metastasis decreased markedly at the highest bufalin dose compared with that in the control. Orthotopic transplanted tumor tissues were necrotic in bufalin-treated groups and the apoptotic cell number was markedly higher at the highest bufalin dose compared with that in the control. Certain changes of expression of AKT/GSK3?/?-catenin/E-cadherin signaling pathway-related proteins were in tumor tissues, which were related to the bufalin dose. Similar results were observed in the LY294002-treated group.Based on the above, one can draw conclusions that bufalin has significant anti-tumor activities and reduces the metastatic potential in an orthotopic transplantation tumor model of human HCC. Inhibition of AKT/GSK3?/?-catenin/E-cadherin signaling pathways by bufalin may show therapeutic effects in advanced HCC patients.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System
