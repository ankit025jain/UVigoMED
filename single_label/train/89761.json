{"id":89761,"title":"[Recreational boating accidents--Part 1: Catamnestic study].","abstract":"Deaths on the water are common in the autopsy material of medicolegal institutes situated on the coast or big rivers and lakes (illustrated by the example of the Institute of Legal Medicine of Greifswald University). They mostly occur during recreational boating activities. Apart from hydro-meteorological influences, human error is the main cause of accidents. Often it is not sufficiently kept in mind whether the boat crew is fit for sailing and proper seamanship is ensured. Drowning (following initial hypothermia) is the most frequent cause of death. Medicolegal aspects are not decisive for ordering a forensic autopsy. As statistics are not compiled in a uniform way, a comparison of the data of different institutions engaged in investigating deaths at sea and during water sports activities is hardly possible, neither on a national nor an international basis--and the reconstruction of aquatic accidents is generally difficult. Fatal accidents can only be prevented by completely clarifying their causes.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683870","annotations":[{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.799597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Recreation","weight":0.635109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.561534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Sea","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea"},{"name":"Drowning","weight":0.433052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Boating","weight":0.391362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boating"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Forensic science","weight":0.337526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science"},{"name":"River","weight":0.3166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River"},{"name":"Coast","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast"},{"name":"Lake","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.281232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.204793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sailing","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing"},{"name":"Seamanship","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamanship"},{"name":"Boat","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat"},{"name":"International","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"List of water sports","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_water_sports"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Greifswald","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greifswald"},{"name":"Hydrometeorology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrometeorology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Aquatic animal","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal"},{"name":"Rowing (sport)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)"},{"name":"Compiler","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"University of Greifswald","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Greifswald"},{"name":"Human reliability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_reliability"},{"name":"Recreational boating","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_boating"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"Medical law","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_law"}]}
