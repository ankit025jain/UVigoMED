{"id":63792,"title":"Recurrent ruptured spleen.","abstract":"Regrowth of splenic tissue after splenectomy for trauma and splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura have been reported. However, rupture of splenic tissue, either spontaneous or traumatic, that requires a second surgical intervention for hemoperitoneum caused by a ruptured splenic nodule or splenosis has rarely been reported. We report the case of a 43-year-old man in whom hemoperitoneum developed 25 years after he underwent an open splenectomy, after a motor vehicle accident, that required removal of a recurrent ruptured splenotic nodule.
