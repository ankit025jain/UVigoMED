{"id":76802,"title":"\"Moving and losing\": A pilot study incorporating physical activity to decrease obesity in the pediatric population.","abstract":"This study was developed as a pilot study to determine if targeted interventions regarding increasing physical activity level through the use of pedometers and fitness DVDs would result in a decrease in BMI in overweight or obese children.24 children aged 4-17 taking part in \"Moving and Losing\" were randomized to (1) Control Group; (2) Pedometer Group; (3) DVD Group; (4) Pedometer + DVD Group and asked to complete self-report physical activity logs at visit one and two. Baseline, midpoint, and endpoint weight, height, Body Mass Index (BMI) were measured for outcome variables.Almost half (42%) of participants turned in their activity logs and pedometers at midpoint, but at endpoint less than a quarter of participants turned in their pedometers and/or activity logs. BMI increased by 4.1% in the Control Group, 8.7% in the Pedometer Group, and 6.7% in the DVD Group. BMI decreased by 0.3% in the Pedometer + DVD Group.The use of pedometers and fitness DVDs may not be culturally acceptable in African-American female children and adolescents from South Carolina who are overweight or obese. Further studies should look into in-depth needs assessments and planning processes that include participants as stakeholders.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908910","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.846825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.780965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.553623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.29426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"South Carolina","weight":0.278771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"},{"name":"DVD","weight":0.22087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Pedometer","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometer"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Logging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"The Carolinas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carolinas"},{"name":"Midpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint"},{"name":"Stakeholder (corporate)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)"},{"name":"Baseline (surveying)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_(surveying)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Fiscal year","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year"},{"name":"Physical activity level","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_activity_level"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"}]}
