{"id":33673,"title":"Long-term effects of a ketogenic diet on body composition and bone mineralization in GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome: a case series.","abstract":"The only known treatment of glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT-1 DS) is a ketogenic diet (KD), which provides the brain with an alternative fuel. Studies in children with intractable epilepsy have shown that a prolonged KD can induce a progressive loss of bone mineral content associated with poor bone health status, probably as a consequence of a chronic acidic environment. The aim of this study is to determine the long-term effects of a KD on body composition and bone mineral status of patients with GLUT-1 DS, is currently unknown.In this case series, we report the changes in body composition and bone mineral status observed in three adult patients with GLUT-1 DS who have been treated with a KD for more than 5 y.A long-term KD did not produce appreciable changes in weight and body composition of adults with GLUT-1 DS. Moreover, we found no evidence of potential adverse effects of a KD on bone health. In summary, this case series contributes to a small but growing body of literature that investigated the potential long-term effects of a KD on bone health.Our data suggest that maintaining a KD for more than 5 y does not pose any major negative effects on body composition, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density in adults with GLUT-1 DS, a finding that is at variance with previous reports focusing on children with intractable epilepsy. Further studies with larger sizes are needed to confirm and expand our findings.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800673","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Ketogenic diet","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.783382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.663352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.583971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"De Vivo disease","weight":0.539495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Vivo_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ketosis","weight":0.512794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.266991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.213811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Glucose transporter","weight":0.144746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_transporter"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.142977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"GLUT1","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLUT1"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Fuel","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"OpenGL Utility Toolkit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Utility_Toolkit"},{"name":"Alternative fuel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_fuel"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Esperanto literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_literature"},{"name":"Hard water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_water"},{"name":"Nintendo DS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS"},{"name":"Membrane transport protein","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_transport_protein"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Bone mineral","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_mineral"},{"name":"Mineralization (biology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralization_(biology)"}]}
