{"id":28802,"title":"[The dermocorticoids, irreplaceable and feared].","abstract":"Dermocorticoids represent a significant part of the therapeutic arsenal in dermatology due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects, with an indication in numerous inflammatory dermatoses. Their cutaneous side effects are feared but are also often over-estimated. On the other hand, the systemic adverse effects are less well studied. We present here the properties of this medicament class and especially the rules to respect to avoid adverse reactions.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791429","annotations":[{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.883832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.783517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.499869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"}]}
