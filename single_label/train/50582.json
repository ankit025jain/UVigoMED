{"id":50582,"title":"[Diabetes mellitus as a modifier of the course of tumors of the female reproductive system].","abstract":"Frequency of separate malignancies and diabetes tends to an increase. This is one of the reasons that diabetes is more often attracting attention as a potential risk factor for cancer. At the same time, in general, relatively less attention is paid to the analysis of the question of whether the presence of diabetes is able to influence on features of neoplasm, inherent at the diagnosis, as well as on the clinical course of the tumor process and its outcomes. In this paper, exactly this aspect of the problem is considered on example of such common and characterized by undoubted specificity of tumors of the female reproductive system as breast cancer and uterine cancer.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772613","annotations":[{"name":"Uterine cancer","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_cancer"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Reproductive system","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_system"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.722715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.711652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Female reproductive system (human)","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_reproductive_system_(human)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"}]}
