{"id":92017,"title":"A new positive-pressure device for nasal foreign body removal.","abstract":"Nasal foreign bodies (FBs) are common causes of pediatric emergency consultations. The different methods for removing nasal FBs have varying levels of efficacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new device for nasal FB removal in children.A nasal occlusion device that uses modulated positive pressure to remove FBs was evaluated in a series of 18 patients ranging in age from 1 to 8 years diagnosed with a nasal FB during a period of 7 months.The device successfully removed FBs in 17 (94.4%) of the 18 patients. In 12 of the cases (66.7%), the FB was removed during the first attempt. None of the patients had complications or sequelae at the time of removal or at the follow-up visit.The nasal occlusion device used in this study was found to be a promising, safe, effective, and easy to use tool for FB removal in a pediatric emergency room setting.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457495","annotations":[{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.359945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.267469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.204081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.0527282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Positive pressure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_pressure"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Fullback (gridiron football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
