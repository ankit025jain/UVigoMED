{"id":55922,"title":"Posterior iris-claw aphakic intraocular lens implantation and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty.","abstract":"To evaluate clinical outcomes and complications after Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) and posterior iris-claw aphakic intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.This prospective cohort study comprised seven consecutive eyes (seven patients) without adequate capsular support and bullous keratopathy undergoing posterior iris-claw aphakic IOL implantation and DMEK. Corneal transparency, central corneal thickness, endothelial cell density, visual outcomes and complication rates were measured during the follow-up.The iris-claw IOLs were inserted during an IOL exchange in three eyes, and as a secondary IOL implantation in one aphakic eye during DMEK procedure. Three eyes had IOL exchange prior to secondary DMEK. Mean follow-up was 7?months (range 3-14?months). The final best spectacle-corrected visual acuity improved significantly (0.33±0.31 logMAR) compared with the preoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (1.84±0.90 logMAR). The mean endothelial cell loss was 24.8% over the follow-up. Complications included graft dislocation in four eyes; which could be easily reattached with a rebubbling procedure. No graft failures, no cases of pupillary block glaucoma and no IOL dislocations were encountered.DMEK and retropupillar iris-claw IOL implantation provide good visual outcomes with a fast visual recovery and appear to be a feasible method for the management of bullous keratopathy but with higher graft detachment rates.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782475","annotations":[{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.898663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.750063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Corneal transplantation","weight":0.692984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_transplantation"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Aphakia","weight":0.666115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphakia"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.638195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.636112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.480243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.437415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.387909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Descemet's membrane","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descemet's_membrane"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.197796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Transparency and translucency","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency"},{"name":"Bullous keratopathy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullous_keratopathy"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"840","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/840"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Head transplant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_transplant"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"}]}
