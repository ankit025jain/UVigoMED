{"id":73222,"title":"Inactivation of PI(3)K p110? breaks regulatory T-cell-mediated immune tolerance to cancer.","abstract":"Inhibitors against the p110? isoform of phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) have shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy in some human leukaemias. As p110? is primarily expressed in leukocytes, drugs against p110? have not been considered for the treatment of solid tumours. Here we report that p110? inactivation in mice protects against a broad range of cancers, including non-haematological solid tumours. We demonstrate that p110? inactivation in regulatory T cells unleashes CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells and induces tumour regression. Thus, p110? inhibitors can break tumour-induced immune tolerance and should be considered for wider use in oncology.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919154","annotations":[{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.75702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.728404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase","weight":0.706541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.559372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.500773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.432366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Hydroxyl","weight":0.336585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.311276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.140202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Immune tolerance","weight":0.13895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_tolerance"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.138352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.107822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0437018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
