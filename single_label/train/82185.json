{"id":82185,"title":"Evaluation of anti-gingivitis benefits of stannous fluoride dentifrice among triclosan dentifrice users.","abstract":"To evaluate the anti-gingivitis benefits of a 0.454% highly bioavailable stannous fluoride dentifrice (SnF2) relative to a 0.3% triclosan/copolymer dentifrice (triclosan/copolymer) among triclosan/copolymer dentifrice users with residual gingivitis.This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel group, 2-month clinical study. Self-reported triclosan/copolymer dentifrice users were recruited and provided with triclosan/copolymer dentifrice to use for 1 month. After this 1-month acclimation period, subjects who had residual gingivitis at the baseline visit were randomized to either the SnF2 dentifrice or the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice (positive control). Subjects performed their treatment unsupervised using their assigned dentifrice following manufacturers' usage instructions for 2 months. The Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) and Modified Gingival Index (MGI) were used to measure gingivitis benefits at baseline and Month 2. An analysis of covariance was performed to compare treatment groups for the post-baseline scores as well as change from baseline, with the baseline score as a covariate. All comparisons were two-sided at the 0.05 level of significance.A total of 150 subjects were randomized to treatment. Both treatment groups experienced significant reductions in number of bleeding sites, gingival bleeding index (GBI), and gingival inflammation (MGI) relative to baseline (P < 0.001). At Month 2, the SnF2 dentifrice group demonstrated significantly lower adjusted mean scores versus the triclosan/copolymer group for number of bleeding sites, GBI, and MGI (P < 0.001). Between-treatment group comparisons for change from baseline values showed that the improvement in number of bleeding sites from baseline for the SnF2 group was 49% greater versus that of the triclosan/copolymer group (P < 0.001), and the GBI and MGI improvements from baseline for the SnF2 group were 48% and 37%, greater, respectively, relative to the triclosan/copolymer group (P < 0.001).","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693625","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.788923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Bioavailability","weight":0.568606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.394785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.291533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Gingivitis","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingivitis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Analysis of covariance","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_covariance"},{"name":"Covariate","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariate"},{"name":"Covariance","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Triclosan","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan"},{"name":"Dentifrice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentifrice"},{"name":"Tin(II) fluoride","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_fluoride"},{"name":"Bleeding on probing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_on_probing"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Unsupervised learning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Tin(II) chloride","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II)_chloride"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Acclimatization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Georgia Bureau of Investigation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bureau_of_Investigation"},{"name":"Mouse Genome Informatics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_Genome_Informatics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.0139332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"}]}
