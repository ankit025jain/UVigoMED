{"id":29957,"title":"Prevalence of and associated factors for adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young Swiss men.","abstract":"The present study aimed to measure the prevalence of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a large, representative sample of young Swiss men and to assess factors associated with this disorder.Our sample consisted of 5656 Swiss men (mean age 20 years) who participated in the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF). ADHD was assessed with the World Health Organization (WHO) adult ADHD Self Report Screener (ASRS). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between ADHD and several socio-demographic, clinical and familial factors.The prevalence of ADHD was 4.0%, being higher in older and French-speaking conscripts. A higher prevalence also was identified among men whose mothers had completed primary or high school/university and those with a family history of alcohol or psychiatric problems. Additionally, adults with ADHD demonstrated impairment in their professional life, as well as considerable mental health impairment.Our results demonstrate that ADHD is common among young Swiss men. The impairments in function and mental health we observed highlight the need for further support and interventions to reduce burden in affected individuals. Interventions that incorporate the whole family also seem crucial.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586672","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.829575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.611456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.569426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.549967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.511358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.472628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.380921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.261427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Switzerland","weight":0.259993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.258789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.252345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.182569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.11105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Conscription","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Self","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Regression (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_(psychology)"},{"name":"Bruxism","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruxism"},{"name":"ADHD predominantly inattentive","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD_predominantly_inattentive"},{"name":"Balance of trade","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
