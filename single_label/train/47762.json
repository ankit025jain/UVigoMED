{"id":47762,"title":"Transarterial chemoembolization in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage 0/A hepatocellular carcinoma.","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 and A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Between January 2001 and September 2011, 129 patients with BCLC stage 0 and stage A HCC who underwent TACE were retrospectively enrolled. Patient characteristics, routine computed tomography and TACE findings, survival time and 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates, risk factors for mortality, and survival rates according to the number of risk factors were assessed.The mean size of HCC tumors was 2.4 ± 1.1 cm, and the mean number of TACE procedures performed was 2.5 ± 2.1. The mean overall survival time and 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 80.6 ± 4.9 mo and 91%, 63% and 49%, respectively. In the Cox regression analysis, a Child-Pugh score > 5 (P = 0.005, OR = 3.86), presence of arterio-venous shunt (P = 0.032, OR = 4.41), amount of lipiodol used (> 7 mL; P = 0.013, OR = 3.51), and female gender (P = 0.008, OR = 3.47) were risk factors for mortality. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates according to the number of risk factors present were 96%, 87% and 87% (no risk factors), 89%, 65%, and 35% (1 risk factor), 96%, 48% and unavailable (2 risk factors), and 63%, 17%, and 0% (3 risk factors), respectively (P < 0.001).TACE may be used as curative-intent therapy in patients with BCLC stage 0 and stage A HCC. The Child-Pugh score, arterio-venous shunt, amount of lipiodol used, and gender were related to mortality after TACE.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574748","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.715286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.649771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.599793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.455971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.301722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.196588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.055098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Barcelona","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona"},{"name":"Lipiodol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipiodol"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"2001","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Cox Communications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Communications"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Survival time","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_time"},{"name":"Arteriovenous fistula","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_fistula"},{"name":"Windows NT 3.51","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.51"}]}
