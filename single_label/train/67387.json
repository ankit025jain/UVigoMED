{"id":67387,"title":"Pharmacokinetic considerations for therapies used to treat interstitial cystitis.","abstract":"Interstitial cystitis (IC) or bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is defined as supra-pubic pain related to bladder filling. IC is characterized by a particular symptom complex with no identifiable causes; as with bladder hypersensitivity it is usually associated with urinary frequency and urgency with bladder pain. No current treatments have a significant impact on symptoms over time.This systematic review examines the pharmacokinetic aspects and adverse event of present IC therapy to highlight appropriate treatment to improve the symptoms of IC. This article reviews material obtained via Medline, PubMed, and EMBASE literature searches up to October 2013.The correct approach to IC should consider a multidisciplinary team of specialists and a multimodal treatment package that include psychotherapy, behavior change, physical activation, and analgesic treatment. Unfortunately, a single therapeutic target for IC is not yet known. With regard to pathophysiology and therapy, there is more to discover. The first insult damages the bladder urothelium, hence vehicles that lead the drug to penetrate the wall of the bladder might be a novel strategic approach.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621003","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Interstitial cystitis","weight":0.815285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_cystitis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.728498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.650644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.544634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Cystitis","weight":0.381232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystitis"},{"name":"Adverse event","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Insult","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult"},{"name":"British Psychological Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Psychological_Society"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"}]}
