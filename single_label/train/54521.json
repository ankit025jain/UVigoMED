{"id":54521,"title":"Circulating docosahexaenoic acid levels are associated with fetal insulin sensitivity.","abstract":"Arachidonic acid (AA; C20?4 n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22?6 n-3) are important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in maintaining pancreatic beta-cell structure and function. Newborns of gestational diabetic mothers are more susceptible to the development of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. It is not known whether low circulating AA or DHA is involved in perinatally \"programming\" this susceptibility. This study aimed to assess whether circulating concentrations of AA, DHA and other fatty acids are associated with fetal insulin sensitivity or beta-cell function, and whether low circulating concentrations of AA or DHA are involved in compromised fetal insulin sensitivity in gestational diabetic pregnancies.In a prospective singleton pregnancy cohort, maternal (32-35 weeks gestation) and cord plasma fatty acids were assessed in relation to surrogate indicators of fetal insulin sensitivity (cord plasma glucose-to-insulin ratio, proinsulin concentration) and beta-cell function (proinsulin-to-insulin ratio) in 108 mother-newborn pairs. Cord plasma DHA levels (in percentage of total fatty acids) were lower comparing newborns of gestational diabetic (n?=?24) vs. non-diabetic pregnancies (2.9% vs. 3.5%, P?=?0.01). Adjusting for gestational age at blood sampling, lower cord plasma DHA levels were associated with lower fetal insulin sensitivity (lower glucose-to-insulin ratio, r?=?0.20, P?=?0.036; higher proinsulin concentration, r?=?-0.37, P <0.0001). The associations remained after adjustment for maternal and newborn characteristics. Cord plasma saturated fatty acids C18?0 and C20?0 were negatively correlated with fetal insulin sensitivity, but their levels were not different between gestational diabetic and non-diabetic pregnancies. Cord plasma AA levels were not correlated with fetal insulin sensitivity.Low circulating DHA levels are associated with compromised fetal insulin sensitivity, and may be involved in perinatally \"programming\" the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the offspring of gestational diabetic mothers.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24454790","annotations":[{"name":"Docosahexaenoic acid","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.816008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.795011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Proinsulin","weight":0.744839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proinsulin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.717082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.697668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.59774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.461139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fat","weight":0.370553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.348154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.238048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0458338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Offspring","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Acids in wine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acids_in_wine"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
