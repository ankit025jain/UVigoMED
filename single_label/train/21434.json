{"id":21434,"title":"Upregulation and lysosomal degradation of AQP4 in rat brains with bacterial meningitis.","abstract":"Brain edema is among the major complications in children with bacterial meningitis. Aquaporins are integral membrane pore proteins that form channels to regulate cellular water content. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which is enriched in parts of astrocytic membranes that are apposed to pial or perivascular basal laminae, is the predominant aquaporin in the central nervous system. Dystroglycan is among the proteins that are responsible for the site-specific anchorage of AQP4. To elucidate the role of AQP4 in the development of brain edema induced by meningitis, a model of bacterial meningitis was established by injecting group B ?-hemolytic Streptococci into the cerebrospinal fluid of three-week-old rats. The brain water content increased in this model compared with that in the control group. The expression of AQP4 and dystroglycan was examined by Western blot and the degradation route of AQP4 was investigated by double immunofluorescence labeling. Western blot results showed that the expression of AQP4 and dystroglycan in rat brain increased in the meningitis model. Meanwhile, AQP4 was co-localized with the marker of lysosome in this model, indicating that the lysosome is involved in AQP4 degradation.
