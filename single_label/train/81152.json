{"id":81152,"title":"Pre-travel preparation of US travelers going abroad to provide humanitarian service, Global TravEpiNet 2009-2011.","abstract":"We analyzed characteristics of humanitarian service workers (HSWs) seen pre-travel at Global TravEpiNet (GTEN) practices during 2009-2011. Of 23,264 travelers, 3,663 (16%) travelers were classified as HSWs. Among HSWs, 1,269 (35%) travelers were medical workers, 1,298 (35%) travelers were non-medical service workers, and 990 (27%) travelers were missionaries. Median age was 29 years, and 63% of travelers were female. Almost one-half (49%) traveled to 1 of 10 countries; the most frequent destinations were Haiti (14%), Honduras (8%), and Kenya (6%). Over 90% of travelers were vaccinated for or considered immune to hepatitis A, typhoid, and yellow fever. However, for hepatitis B, 292 (29%) of 990 missionaries, 228 (18%) of 1,298 non-medical service workers, and 76 (6%) of 1,269 medical workers were not vaccinated or considered immune. Of HSWs traveling to Haiti during 2010, 5% of travelers did not receive malaria chemoprophylaxis. Coordinated efforts from HSWs, HSW agencies, and clinicians could reduce vaccine coverage gaps and improve use of malaria chemoprophylaxis.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445203","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis A","weight":0.936098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A"},{"name":"Yellow fever","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Haiti","weight":0.863479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Kenya","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya"},{"name":"Honduras","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.685513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Typhoid fever","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Missionary","weight":0.45747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary"},{"name":"Humanitarian aid","weight":0.391224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.262149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Humanitarianism","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Chemoprophylaxis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoprophylaxis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Yellow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow"},{"name":"663","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/663"},{"name":"990","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/990"},{"name":"298","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/298"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"292","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/292"},{"name":"264","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/264"},{"name":"228","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"}]}
