{"id":40738,"title":"Myoarchitectural and functional alterations in rabbit external anal sphincter muscle following experimental surgical trauma.","abstract":"Obstetrical trauma to external anal sphincter (EAS) is extremely common; however, its role in the development of anal incontinence is not clear. We examined the regenerative process and functional impact of experimental surgical trauma to EAS muscle in an animal model. Surgical myotomy, a craniocaudal incision extending along the entire length and thickness of the EAS, was performed in rabbits. Animals were allowed to recover, and anal pressures were recorded at weekly intervals for 12 wk using a custom-designed probe system to determine the length-tension property of EAS muscle. Animals were killed at predetermined time intervals, and the anal canal was harvested for histochemical studies (for determination of muscle/connective tissue/collagen) and sarcomere length measurement. In addition, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI) and fiber tracking was performed to determine myoarchitectural changes in the EAS. Myotomy of the EAS muscle resulted in significant impairment of its length-tension property that showed only partial recovery during the 12-wk study period. Histology revealed marked increase in the fibrosis (connective tissue = 69% following myotomy vs. 28% in controls) at 3 wk, which persisted at 12 wk. Immunostaining studies confirmed deposition of collagen in the fibrotic tissue. There was no change in the sarcomere length following myotomy. MR-DTI studies revealed disorganized muscle fiber orientation in the regenerating muscle. We conclude that, following experimental injury, the EAS muscle heals with an increase in the collagen content and loss of normal myoarchitecture, which we suspect is the cause of impaired EAS function.
