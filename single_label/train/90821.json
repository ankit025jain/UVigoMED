{"id":90821,"title":"Donor-site preferences in women during autologous skin grafting.","abstract":"Autologous split-thickness skin grafting has been proven to provide the best cosmetic and functional outcome after cutaneous burn injuries and thus is the standard of care. Clinical observations have shown that female burn patients frequently have greater difficulty choosing a donor site than do male burn patients. However, there is a lack of data characterizing donor-site preferences among women with burns.The purpose of this study was to examine donor-site preferences among women using an online survey that included 356 responders between January 4, 2012, and April 4, 2012.This study found that there was a preference for posterior donor sites, with lower back, left buttock, and left posterior thigh being the most preferred sites. The least preferred locations were the right anterior upper arm, any aspect of the forearms, and the chest. Those surveyed and reporting a higher education level or concerns with scarring were least likely to choose anterior locations. Age, concern for color changes, and prior surgery or grafting had no statistically significant effect on donor-site preference.Given these strong preferences among female patients, posterior donor sites should be considered and discussed as compared with the current standard of using lateral or anterior thigh donor sites.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24572883","annotations":[{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Buttocks","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Thigh","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.547908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.395353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.301491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.249941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.173633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.167001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.0926757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0561009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"January 4","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_4"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"356","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/356"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Paid survey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_survey"},{"name":"April 4","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_4"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Opinion poll","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"}]}
