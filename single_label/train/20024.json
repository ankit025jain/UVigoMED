{"id":20024,"title":"In vitro susceptibility of Candida isolates from organ transplant recipients to newer antifungals.","abstract":"Organ transplant recipients (OTR) are at higher risk of developing life-threatening infections. In this study, we tested 527 Candida isolates obtained from the oral and genital mucosa from OTR and healthy controls in order to monitor antifungal susceptibility patterns in this particular risk group. Testing was carried out in parallel for already marketed azoles and anidulafungin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the E-test(Â®) for azoles and CLSI broth microdilution for anidulafungin. Overall, there was no difference in the distribution of Candida spp. for both groups, C. albicans being the most frequently isolated Candida sp. followed by C. glabrata. Also, there were only minor differences in the susceptibility patterns to all antifungal agents. All C. albicans isolates were fully susceptible to fluconazole and voriconazole. In C. glabrata, 2.2% (n = 1) were resistant to fluconazole, and 82.6% (n = 38) to itraconazole, and in C. krusei, 66.7% (n = 2) were resistant in itraconazole. All strains were susceptible to voriconazole. Only fluconazole showed a higher rate of resistant C. glabrata isolates for OTR (3.7%), whereas the control group showed only intermediate susceptible and no resistant isolates. As there are no breakpoints established for posaconazole by CLSI, breakpoints determined by EUCAST were used. A total of 87.9% of C. albicans, 81.3% of C. parapsilosis and 66.7% of C. tropicalis were considered susceptible. C. glabrata and C. krusei showed higher MIC values and thus lesser susceptibility than the other Candida species. There were no differences observed between OTR and control groups. For anidulafungin, 99.8% of C. albicans isolates were susceptible, 0.2% were intermediate, whereas for C. glabrata, only 95.3% were susceptible, 0.2% were resistant and 4.5% were interpreted as intermediate. Interestingly, the two resistant isolates were found in the control group. Also, the controls showed a marginally higher percentage of intermediate strains compared to the transplant patients. All in all, resistant isolates were only observed for C. glabrata of the control group.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682600","annotations":[{"name":"Itraconazole","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itraconazole"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.898663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Voriconazole","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voriconazole"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Posaconazole","weight":0.720976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posaconazole"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.675131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.666928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Azole","weight":0.595305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azole"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.523759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.396681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.361872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Candida krusei","weight":0.337038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_krusei"},{"name":"Anidulafungin","weight":0.286689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anidulafungin"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Candida glabrata","weight":0.193233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_glabrata"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0197053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"527","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/527"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"In C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_C"},{"name":"Off-the-Record Messaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_and_Laboratory_Standards_Institute"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Broth","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broth"},{"name":"Candida tropicalis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_tropicalis"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Monitor (warship)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(warship)"},{"name":"Breakpoint","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
