{"id":7152,"title":"Susceptibility of fish and turtles to three ranaviruses isolated from different ectothermic vertebrate classes.","abstract":"Ranaviruses have been associated with mortality of lower vertebrates around the world. Frog virus 3 (FV3)-like ranaviruses have been isolated from different ectothermic vertebrate classes; however, few studies have demonstrated whether this pathogen can be transmitted among classes. Using FV3-like ranaviruses isolated from the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus, eastern box turtle Terrapene carolina carolina, and Pallid Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus, we tested for the occurrence of interclass transmission (i.e., infection) and host susceptibility (i.e., percent mortality) for five juvenile fish and three juvenile turtle species exposed to each of these isolates. Exposure was administered via water bath (10(3) PFU/mL) for 3 d and survival was monitored for 28 d. Florida softshell turtles Apalone ferox experienced no mortality, but 10% and 20% of individuals became infected by the turtle and fish isolate, respectively. Similarly, 5% of Mississippi map turtles Graptemys pseudogeographica kohni were subclinically infected with the turtle isolate at the end of the experiment. Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus experienced 5% mortality when exposed to the turtle isolate, while Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis experienced 10% mortality when exposed to the turtle and amphibian isolates and 5% mortality when exposed to the fish isolate. Our results demonstrated that interclass transmission of FV3-like ranaviruses is possible. Although substantial mortality did not occur in our experiments, the occurrence of low mortality and subclinical infections suggest that fish and aquatic turtles may function as reservoirs for FV3-like ranaviruses. Additionally, our study is the first to report transmission of FV3-like ranaviruses between fish and chelonians.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895866","annotations":[{"name":"Amphibian","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian"},{"name":"Channel catfish","weight":0.891218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_catfish"},{"name":"Vertebrate","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate"},{"name":"Bullfrog","weight":0.88562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfrog"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Frog","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Turtle","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle"},{"name":"Sturgeon","weight":0.731945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon"},{"name":"Ectotherm","weight":0.715166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectotherm"},{"name":"Catfish","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfish"},{"name":"Common box turtle","weight":0.689012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_box_turtle"},{"name":"Eastern box turtle","weight":0.623475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_box_turtle"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.58362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Florida","weight":0.524538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"},{"name":"Florida softshell turtle","weight":0.388182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_softshell_turtle"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.380882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Box turtle","weight":0.325848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_turtle"},{"name":"Aquatic animal","weight":0.28939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal"},{"name":"Mississippi","weight":0.276894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.18028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Gambusia","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambusia"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0461352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Juvenile (organism)","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)"},{"name":"Gambusia affinis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambusia_affinis"},{"name":"Pallid sturgeon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallid_sturgeon"},{"name":"False map turtle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_map_turtle"},{"name":"Graptemys","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graptemys"},{"name":"Apalone","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apalone"},{"name":"Trionychidae","weight":0.0283604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trionychidae"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"English Channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Bathing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing"},{"name":"Fishing vessel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel"},{"name":"Ictalurus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ictalurus"},{"name":"Anamniotes","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamniotes"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
