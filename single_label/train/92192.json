{"id":92192,"title":"Neurological imaging of brain damages after radiotherapy and/or chimiotherapy.","abstract":"Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may induce neurological toxicities with different appearances on CT and MRI scans. While optimized radiotherapy techniques have reduced some complications, new unwanted effects have occurred on account of therapeutic protocols involving the simultaneous use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Advances in radio-surgery, innovative anti-angiogenic therapies, as well as prolonged patient survival have led to the emergence of new deleterious side effects. In this report, we describe the early, semi-delayed, and late encephalic complications, while specifying how to identify the morphological lesions depending on the therapeutic protocol.
