{"id":65000,"title":"Functional sperm testing and the role of proteomics in the evaluation of male infertility.","abstract":"The limitations of conventional semen analysis testing in the diagnosis and management of male factor infertility have been well documented. A number of more sophisticated assays including measurements of sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation rates, seminal oxidative stress, and antioxidant capacity have been increasingly used in the evaluation of male infertility. Moreover, in the past few years, tremendous advancements in the burgeoning field of sperm proteomics promise to revolutionize the andrologist's diagnostic armamentarium, as will be discussed in this review.
