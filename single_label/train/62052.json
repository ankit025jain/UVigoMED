{"id":62052,"title":"Glycated albumin; clinical usefulness.","abstract":"The main purpose of treating diabetes is to prevent the onset and progression of diabetic chronic complications. Since the mechanism of onset of chronic complications is still not well understood, the main strategy to achieve this purpose is to bring plasma glucose levels as close as possible to those in healthy subjects and maintain good glycemic control over the long term. Since glycation among various proteins is increased in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic subjects, glycated protein can be used as a glycemic control indicator. Currently, among these glycated proteins, HbA1c is used as the gold standard of glycemic control indicators. However, HbA1c does not accurately reflect the actual status of glycemic control in some conditions with rapid changes in glycemic control and in patients with anemia (hemolytic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, etc.) and variant hemoglobin. In comparison, glycated albumin (GA) more accurately reflects changes in plasma glucose during the short term and postprandial plasma glucose. GA also reflects glycemic control in patients with hematologic disorders whereas GA does not reflect glycemic control in patients with disorder of albumin metabolism. GA is a glycemic control indicator which overcomes most of the disadvantages of HbA1c, and could be therefore expected to replace HbA1c as the standard glycemic control indicator in the near future. However, it is necessary to accumulate more evidences from large research studies on the effective directions for measuring GA.
