{"id":56344,"title":"Piggyback intraocular lens implantation to correct pseudophakic refractive error after segmental multifocal intraocular lens implantation.","abstract":"To evaluate refractive and visual outcomes of secondary piggyback intraocular lens implantation in patients diagnosed as having residual ametropia following segmental multifocal lens implantation.Data of 80 pseudophakic eyes with ametropia that underwent Sulcoflex aspheric 653L intraocular lens implantation (Rayner Intraocular Lenses Ltd., East Sussex, United Kingdom) to correct residual refractive error were analyzed. All eyes previously had in-the-bag zonal refractive multifocal intraocular lens implantation (Lentis Mplus MF30, models LS-312 and LS-313; Oculentis GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and required residual refractive error correction. Outcome measurements included uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected near visual acuity, distance-corrected near visual acuity, manifest refraction, and complications. One-year data are presented in this study.The mean spherical equivalent ranged from -1.75 to +3.25 diopters (D) preoperatively (mean: +0.58 ± 1.15 D) and reduced to -1.25 to +0.50 D (mean: -0.14 ± 0.28 D; P < .01). Postoperatively, 93.8% of eyes were within ±0.50 D and 98.8% were within ±1.00 D of emmetropia. The mean uncorrected distance visual acuity improved significantly from 0.28 ± 0.16 to 0.01 ± 0.10 logMAR and 78.8% of eyes achieved 6/6 (Snellen 20/20) or better postoperatively. The mean uncorrected near visual acuity changed from 0.43 ± 0.28 to 0.19 ± 0.15 logMAR. There was no significant change in corrected distance visual acuity or distance-corrected near visual acuity. No serious intraoperative or postoperative complications requiring secondary intraocular lens removal occurred.Sulcoflex lenses proved to be a predictable and safe option for correcting residual refractive error in patients diagnosed as having pseudophakia.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702574","annotations":[{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.874293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.809037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Dioptre","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.671842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Aspheric lens","weight":0.557154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspheric_lens"},{"name":"Camera lens","weight":0.538096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_lens"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"Progressive lens","weight":0.323331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_lens"},{"name":"Snellen chart","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"},{"name":"Sussex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex"},{"name":"East Sussex","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex"},{"name":"Emmetropia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmetropia"},{"name":"Berlin","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"East Germany","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"313","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/313"},{"name":"653","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/653"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"2020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Midfielder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"GmbH","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GmbH"},{"name":"Error detection and correction","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction"},{"name":"Error","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"}]}
