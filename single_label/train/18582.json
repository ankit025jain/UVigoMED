{"id":18582,"title":"Design-led choice is a growing feature.","abstract":"Alongside key elements such as lighting, interior d√©cor, artwork, and good air quality, the quality of furniture in a healthcare setting plays a key role in creating a comfortable, fit-for-purpose, and therapeutic environment for patients, and a good staff working environment. Specifiers of healthcare furniture must, however, balance the need for comfort, aesthetics, and an appropriate 'style', with practical factors such as ease-of-cleaning, durability, robustness, load-bearing capacity, and, where patients are at risk of self-harm, an anti-ligature design. HEJ asked Alan Towns, managing director of Knightsbridge Furniture, for his views on some of the key aspects of furniture selection and specification for healthcare facilities.","date":"2014-05-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783328","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.547774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Furniture","weight":0.432542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.391167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Lighting","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting"},{"name":"Air quality","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chief executive officer","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"},{"name":"Film director","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Specification (technical standard)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)"},{"name":"Knightsbridge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightsbridge"},{"name":"Key (lock)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(lock)"},{"name":"Visual arts","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts"},{"name":"Durable good","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_good"}]}
