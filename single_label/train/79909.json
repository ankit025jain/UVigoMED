{"id":79909,"title":"A genome scan for Plasmodium falciparum malaria identifies quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 5q31, 6p21.3, 17p12, and 19p13.","abstract":"Genome-wide studies have mapped several loci controlling Plasmodium falciparum mild malaria and parasitaemia, only two of them being significant at the genome level. The objective of the present study was to identify malaria resistance loci in individuals living in Burkina Faso.A genome scan that involved 314 individuals belonging to 63 families was performed. Markers located within chromosomes 6p21.3 and 17p12 were genotyped in 247 additional individuals belonging to 55 families. The linkage and the association of markers with parasitaemia and mild malaria were assessed by using the maximum-likelihood binomial method extended to quantitative trait linkage and the quantitative trait disequilibrium test, respectively.Multipoint linkage analysis showed a significant linkage of mild malaria to chromosome 6p21.3 (LOD score 3.73, P?=?1.7 10-5), a suggestive linkage of mild malaria to chromosome 19p13.12 (LOD score 2.50, P?=?3.5 10-4), and a suggestive linkage of asymptomatic parasitaemia to chromosomes 6p21.3 (LOD score 2.36, P?=?4.9 10-4) and 17p12 (LOD score 2.87, P?=?1.4 10-4). Genome-wide family-based association analysis revealed a significant association between three chromosome 5q31 markers and asymptomatic parasitaemia, whereas there was no association with mild malaria. When taking into account 247 additional individuals, a significant linkage of asymptomatic parasitaemia to chromosome 17p12 (LOD score 3.6, P?=?2 10-5) was detected.A new genome-wide significant malaria locus on chromosome 17p12 and a new suggestive locus on chromosome 19p13.12 are reported. Moreover, there was evidence that confirmed the influence of chromosomes 5q31 and 6p21.3 as loci controlling mild malaria or asymptomatic parasitaemia.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884991","annotations":[{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.900892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.839755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Chromosome 6 (human)","weight":0.813654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_6_(human)"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.767583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.765787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Chromosome 17 (human)","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_17_(human)"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.277943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.24992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.126815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Chromosome 19 (human)","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_19_(human)"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.105101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Binomial nomenclature","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature"},{"name":"Burkina Faso","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso"},{"name":"Binomial options pricing model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model"},{"name":"Chromosome 5 (human)","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_5_(human)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"247","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"}]}
