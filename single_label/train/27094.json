{"id":27094,"title":"2014 hypertension recommendations from the eighth joint national committee panel members raise concerns for elderly black and female populations.","abstract":"A report from panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee titled \"2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults\" has garnered much attention due to its major change in recommendations for hypertension treatment for patients ?60 years of age and for their treatment goal. In response, certain groups have opposed the decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic BP ?150 mm Hg and treat to a goal systolic BP of <150 mm Hg in the general population age ?60 years. This paper contains 3 sections-an introduction followed by the opinions of 2 writing groups-outlining objections to or support of maintaining this proposed strategy in certain at-risk populations, namely African Americans, women, and the elderly. Several authors argue for maintaining current targets, as opposed to adopting the new recommendations, to allow for optimal treatment for older women and African Americans, helping to close sex and race/ethnicity gaps in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060376","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.840208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.65757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.650423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.622971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.565827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.283394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.229382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.214973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.185466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.170908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.13073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Writing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Formula One","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Committee","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee"}]}
