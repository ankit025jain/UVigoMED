{"id":54556,"title":"Effects of exenatide on metabolic parameters/control in obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"The effects of exenatide on glycemic control, lipid metabolism, blood pressure, and gastrointestinal symptoms were investigated in obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Twenty-six outpatients were enrolled and administered 5 ?g of exenatide twice daily. If there was insufficient weight loss and/or insufficient improvement in glycemic control, the dose was increased to 10 ?g twice daily. Follow-up was continued until the 12th week of administration. Hemoglobin A1c, glycoalbumin, fasting plasma glucose, body weight, fasting serum C-peptide, serum lipids, blood pressure, and pulse rate were measured before and after the observation period. In the initial phase of exenatide therapy, each patient received a diary to record gastrointestinal symptoms. During treatment with exenatide, hemoglobin A1c decreased significantly and serum C-peptide increased significantly. Body weight, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly. Nausea was the most frequent gastrointestinal symptom and occurred in 16 patients. Its onset was noted at a mean of 1.7 h after injection, the mean duration was 1.1 h, and it continued for a mean of 9.3 days after the initiation of administration. Patients with nausea showed a significant decrease in hemoglobin Alc, glycoalbumin, or body weight compared with those without nausea. These findings suggest that a more marked improvement in metabolic parameters by exenatide can be partly dependent on the manifestation of gastrointestinal symptoms.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452017","annotations":[{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Exenatide","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exenatide"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.851497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.743227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.727753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Gastroenteritis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.694762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.49269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.395062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.333977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
