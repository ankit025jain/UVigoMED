{"id":13120,"title":"Cranial tibial plating in the management of failed tibial tuberosity advancement in four large breed dogs.","abstract":"The management of failed surgical procedures involving osteotomy for tibial tuberosity advancement can be demanding due to the limited available bone stock, which must be large enough to counteract the powerful proximal and cranial distractive forces exerted by the quadriceps mechanism. Initial mode of failure may be related to implant failure, fracture of the tibial tuberosity, or a combination of both. The complications and management of the cases reported here were all associated with avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity following tibial tuberosity advancement. In all cases, a cranial tibial dynamic compression plate was applied to reduce the fractures and stabilize the osteotomy. No further major complications associated with the implants or fracture occurred. Radiographic evidence of progression of fracture healing was documented in all four cases at the six to eight-week postoperative follow-up. Long-term follow-up information was available for three out of four cases at nine to 23 months after surgery by telephone interview and validated owner questionnaires. Owners reported return to normal exercise with intermittent lameness occurring in two of the three cases. The authors concluded that this technique offers an alternative technique for the management of such fractures, in particular in large breed dogs where sufficient tibial tuberosity bone stock remains.
