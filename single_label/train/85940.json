{"id":85940,"title":"Over-adduction of the unaffected vocal fold during phonation in the unilaterally paralyzed larynx.","abstract":"Over-adduction of the unaffected vocal fold may not compensate vocal function in unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP).To determine whether over-adduction of the unaffected vocal fold has any impact on vocal function in patients with UVFP.A total of 101 patients with UVFP who underwent three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) examination of the larynx served as subjects. Three-dimensional endoscopic images together with coronal images during phonation were produced to evaluate over-adduction of the unaffected fold, posterior glottal gap, and differences in the vertical position and thickness between the vocal folds. Maximum phonation time (MPT) and mean airflow rate (MFR) were measured.In all, 47 patients showed over-adduction. Their MPT and MFR were 4.9 ± 2.9 s and 653 ± 504 ml/s, respectively. The remaining 54 did not show over-adduction. Their MPT and MFR were 4.7 ± 2.7 s and 574 ± 384 ml/s, respectively. There were no significant differences in MPT or MFR between the two groups. Of the 47 patients with over-adduction, 9 showed no posterior glottal gap. However, their vocal function was not significantly different from that of 38 patients with posterior glottal gap or from that of 43 patients without over-adduction and having a posterior glottal gap.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834940","annotations":[{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Vocal folds","weight":0.445403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Phonation","weight":0.236645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonation"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.188433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Aerodynamics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"653","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/653"},{"name":"Coronal consonant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_consonant"},{"name":"384","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/384"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Glottal consonant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_consonant"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Fold (geology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(geology)"},{"name":"Masalit language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masalit_language"},{"name":"Earth Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Party"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Human voice","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_voice"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Orders, decorations, and medals of Nigeria","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_Nigeria"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
