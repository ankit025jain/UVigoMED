{"id":68110,"title":"A novel pathway links oxidative stress to loss of insulin growth factor-2 (IGF2) imprinting through NF-?B activation.","abstract":"Genomic imprinting is the allele-specific expression of a gene based on parental origin. Loss of imprinting(LOI) of Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) during aging is important in tumorigenesis, yet the regulatory mechanisms driving this event are largely unknown. In this study oxidative stress, measured by increased NF-?B activity, induces LOI in both cancerous and noncancerous human prostate cells. Decreased expression of the enhancer-blocking element CCCTC-binding factor(CTCF) results in reduced binding of CTCF to the H19-ICR (imprint control region), a major factor in the allelic silencing of IGF2. This ICR then develops increased DNA methylation. Assays identify a recruitment of the canonical pathway proteins NF-?B p65 and p50 to the CTCF promoter associated with the co-repressor HDAC1 explaining gene repression. An I?B? super-repressor blocks oxidative stress-induced activation of NF-?B and IGF2 imprinting is maintained. In vivo experiments using I?B? mutant mice with continuous NF-?B activation demonstrate increased IGF2 LOI further confirming a central role for canonical NF-?B signaling. We conclude CTCF plays a central role in mediating the effects of NF-?B activation that result in altered imprinting both in vitro and in vivo. This novel finding connects inflammation found in aging prostate tissues with the altered epigenetic landscape.
