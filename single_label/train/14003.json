{"id":14003,"title":"Cytochrome P450 enzyme regulation by glucocorticoids and consequences in terms of drug interaction.","abstract":"Due to their multiple effects, glucocorticoids (GCs) have versatile medical uses. They can regulate many xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily, and thus, influence pharmacotherapy.The aim of this paper is to summarize the molecular effects of GCs on CYP as well as the available clinical evidence on drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between GCs and other drugs in which GCs influence the metabolism of other medicines through modifying CYP activity. We used the factographic database DRUGDEXÂ® along with bibliographic searches.Most of the literature reported CYP3A4 induction by GCs, but this was not proved in all research. As the conclusions on these DDIs are conflicting, there are several issues to be considered like the dosage of GCs, the length of GCs treatment and concomitant therapy, all of which can have an additive inducing effect. Further, in designing a DDI study, crossover studies are preferred. A literature search of the abovementioned information resources provided dissimilar results.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451000","annotations":[{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.811277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.74304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.535535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.519642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"CYP3A4","weight":0.493471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.446644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Cytochrome","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.150637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Medical cannabis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Bibliography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliography"},{"name":"Didanosine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didanosine"},{"name":"General contractor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_contractor"},{"name":"Device driver","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver"},{"name":"Fictional crossover","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_crossover"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"}]}
