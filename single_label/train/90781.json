{"id":90781,"title":"[Fracture risk associated with drugs other than glucocorticoids].","abstract":"Many drugs influence fracture risk besides glucocorticoid, a most common cause of drug-induced osteoporosis. It is well established that drugs used for anti-sex steroids therapy for breast and prostate cancers increase fracture risk, including GnRH agonists, aromatase inhibitors, and anti-androgens. Increased fracture risk is also established with anti-diabetic thiazolidinediones by a randomized control study as well as meta analysis of observational studies. Multiple observational studies have indicated increased fracture risks with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors. Excess thyroid hormones, anti epileptics, heparin, warfarin, may also be associated with an increase in fracture risks. On the contrary, statins, thiazides, beta blockers, and nitrates may be associated with decreased fracture risks.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576932","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Warfarin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Aromatase","weight":0.860214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Aromatase inhibitor","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.801413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Thiazolidinedione","weight":0.779953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazolidinedione"},{"name":"Beta blocker","weight":0.774554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone","weight":0.770506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_agonist"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Statin","weight":0.715333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.692299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Antiandrogen","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiandrogen"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Thyroid hormone","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.56212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Thiazide","weight":0.558375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazide"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.407563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.334897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Nitrate","weight":0.282956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.188651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"}]}
