{"id":79651,"title":"[Clinical efficacy of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate in treatment of advanced schistosomiasis].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical efficacy of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) in the treatment of advanced schistosomiasis.Fifty cases with advanced schistosomiasis admitted to the Touzao Township Hospital of Dongtai City during the period from November 2012 to November 2013 were treated with STS for 10 days, and the internal diameter of the portal vein, levels of ALT, AST, gamma-GT, PIIIP, CIV, HA and LN were measured and compared before and after the administration of STS.The mean levels of all serological parameters except HA were within the normal range before STS treatment, while the highest positive rate was detected in gamma-GT (26.0%) and HA (54.0%). Following the STS treatment, the mean levels of all parameters and the positive rates reduced, with the greatest reduction observed in gamma-GT (36.7%) and HA (37.8%); however, the mean HA level was still higher than the normal range. The mean internal diameter of the portal vein reduced from (10.5 +/- 1.7) mm before the STS treatment to (9.8 +/- 1.3) mm after the STS administration, with a significant diffrtence (P < 0.05).STS appears effective in the treatment of advanced schistosomiasis.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051848","annotations":[{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.485619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.477939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.340976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.282867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.176385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Sulfonate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonate"},{"name":"CIV (band)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIV_(band)"},{"name":"Salvia miltiorrhiza","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_miltiorrhiza"},{"name":"Dongtai","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongtai"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Space Shuttle program","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Lega Nord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"Institute of Internal Auditors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Internal_Auditors"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Township (New Jersey)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township_(New_Jersey)"}]}
