{"id":63094,"title":"Efficacy and safety of platinum combination chemotherapy re-challenge for relapsed patients with non-small-cell lung cancer after postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy of cisplatin plus vinorelbine.","abstract":"There is no standard therapy for relapsed patients who have received postoperative platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy for resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the efficacy and safety of platinum combination chemotherapy re-challenge for such patients.Medical records from 3 institutes from April 2005 to July 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent complete surgical resection were eligible if they received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin plus vinorelbine once and then re-challenge with platinum combination chemotherapy.Sixteen patients were enrolled in this study. After re-challenge with platinum combination chemotherapy, we observed an overall response rate of 31.2% (5/16) and a disease control rate of 81.2% (13/16). Median progression-free survival and overall survival from the start of the re-administration of platinum combination chemotherapy were 6.5 and 28.0 months, respectively. Frequently observed severe adverse events (?grade 3) included neutropenia (31.2%), thrombocytopenia (31.2%), leukopenia (12.5%) and hyponatremia (12.5%). Frequently observed non-hematological toxicities (?grade 2) were anorexia (37.5%) and nausea (37.5%).Re-challenge with platinum combination chemotherapy was effective and safe; therefore, this therapy should be considered as a treatment option for relapsed patients after postoperative cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for resected NSCLC.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480845","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Hyponatremia","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Vinorelbine","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinorelbine"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.682669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.645936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.550182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.449876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"History of cancer chemotherapy","weight":0.33296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cancer_chemotherapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.302391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.284157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"}]}
