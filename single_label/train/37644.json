{"id":37644,"title":"Cardiac troponin I concentrations as a marker of neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months in newborns with perinatal asphyxia.","abstract":"To investigate whether creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) can be used to predict neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months in infants with perinatal asphyxia (PA). The diagnostic value of cTnI to assess myocardial dysfunction was considered as well.Retrospective study of 178 neonates admitted with PA. cTnI concentrations measured within 12?h of birth were compared with medium-term outcome assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. cTnI concentrations measured within 12?h of birth were compared with clinical grade of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and with duration of inotropic support. Two-dimensional Doppler and color Doppler findings were recorded. Fractional shortening, tricuspid and mitral regurgitation were evaluated.A statistically significant correlation between cTnI concentration and BSID-II score was found (mental development index r -0.69, P<0.05 and psychomotor development index r -0.39, P<0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation between CK-MB and BSID-II score (P>0.05).Serum cTnI concentrations and duration of inotropic support were significantly greater with increasing severity of PA. cTnI was negatively correlated with fraction shortening (r -0.64; P<0.05). The severity of tricuspid regurgitation was correlated with the cTnI concentration (r 0.61; P<0.05).In asphyxiated neonates, cTnI concentrations within 12?h of birth correlate with medium-term outcome. Early cTnI concentration correlates with severity of HIE, myocardial dysfunction and with Bayley II scores at 18 months.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases
