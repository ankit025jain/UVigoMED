{"id":59249,"title":"[Follow-ups of mid-term and long-term outcomes for uterine intramural myomas after percutaneous microwave ablation therapy].","abstract":"To evaluate the mid-term and long-term clinical outcomes for symptomatic intramural uterine myoma after ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave ablation therapy (PMAT).A total of 123 women with intramural uterine myoma underwent PMAT. Prospective studies were conducted to compare the dominant fibroid volume (FV), hemoglobin (HGB) and Uterine Fibroid Symptoms and Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) at baseline and 1, 2, 3 and 4 years of follow-upComparing with the baseline, the shrinkage rate of FV at 1 year follow-up was 74.5%. HGB of anemic patients pre-PMAT increased from 91 ± 11 to 114 ± 20 g/L. Two parts of UFS-QOL symptoms severity scores (SSS) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) changed from 43 ± 10 to 18 ± 16 and 41 ± 21 to 90 ± 16 respectively at 1year follow-up. All four items stayed nearly the same at 2, 3 and 4 years post-therapy.Ultrasound-guided PMAT of uterine fibroids can effectively ameliorate the mid-term and long-term clinical syndromes and improve quality of life by shrinking fibroids effectively or even disappearing completely.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842204","annotations":[{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.947293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Leiomyoma","weight":0.859473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiomyoma"},{"name":"Uterine fibroid","weight":0.806541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.765164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.352944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.303665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Plasma membrane monoamine transporter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_membrane_monoamine_transporter"},{"name":"Microwave","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave"},{"name":"Siding Spring Survey","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siding_Spring_Survey"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Intramural sports","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramural_sports"},{"name":"Fishing vessel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
