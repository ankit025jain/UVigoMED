{"id":62754,"title":"Non-thrombotic superior sagittal sinus occlusion with intracranial hypertension following metastatic Burkitt's lymphoma.","abstract":"Intracranial metastasis is a known complication of Burkitt's lymphoma, however, superior sagittal sinus invasion by dural metastasis from Burkitt's lymphoma is rare. We report a young adult, known case of Burkitt's lymphoma, who presented with features of raised intracranial pressure secondary to dural sinus invasion from metastasis. Prompt radiotherapy to these lesions can bring about recanalization of the sinus with elevation of symptoms.
