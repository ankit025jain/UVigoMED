{"id":87526,"title":"Ultrasound-guided interscalene-supraclavicular block for an intramedullary nailing of a pathologic humeral fracture: practical application of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia.","abstract":"Fractures of the proximal upper extremity present a challenge to the anesthesia provider when administering a regional anesthetic because the dermatomal distribution of the upper extremity requires more local anesthetic coverage than any single brachial plexus nerve block can provide. A 60-year-old woman underwent intramedullary nailing of a pathologic humeral fracture using a combination of regional and general anesthesia. This case study shows how ultrasound guidance permitted the performance of both an interscalene and supraclavicular nerve block for a single procedure without the increased volume of local anesthetic that would normally be required, while still providing complete coverage of the entire upper extremity.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109160","annotations":[{"name":"Brachial plexus","weight":0.828885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_plexus"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.72699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"General anaesthesia","weight":0.72699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.682669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Regional anaesthesia","weight":0.676146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.598879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Local anesthetic","weight":0.592908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_anesthetic"},{"name":"Nerve block","weight":0.479775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_block"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.317087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.212435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.193093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Dermatome (anatomy)","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatome_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.103971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Supraclavicular nerves","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraclavicular_nerves"},{"name":"Plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plexus"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 60","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_60"},{"name":"Brachial artery","weight":0.0120813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachial_artery"}]}
