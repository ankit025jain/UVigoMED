{"id":50485,"title":"Gene polymorphisms in female reproduction.","abstract":"This chapter presents an overview of the gene polymorphisms underlying the functions of ovarian receptors and their clinical implications in the female fecundity. A selection of genetic studies revealing significant associations between receptor polymorphisms, gene mutations, and some pathological conditions (i.e., female infertility, premature ovarian failure, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis) are reviewed.
