{"id":35177,"title":"Pathophysiological mechanisms of high-intensity focused ultrasound-mediated vascular occlusion and relevance to non-invasive fetal surgery.","abstract":"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive technology, which can be used occlude blood vessels in the body. Both the theory underlying and practical process of blood vessel occlusion are still under development and relatively sparse in vivo experimental and therapeutic data exist. HIFU would however provide an alternative to surgery, particularly in circumstances where serious complications inherent to surgery outweigh the potential benefits. Accordingly, the HIFU technique would be of particular utility for fetal and placental interventions, where open or endoscopic surgery is fraught with difficulty and likelihood of complications including premature delivery. This assumes that HIFU could be shown to safely and effectively occlude blood vessels in utero. To understand these mechanisms more fully, we present a review of relevant cross-specialty literature on the topic of vascular HIFU and suggest an integrative mechanism taking into account clinical, physical and engineering considerations through which HIFU may produce vascular occlusion. This model may aid in the design of HIFU protocols to further develop this area, and might be adapted to provide a non-invasive therapy for conditions in fetal medicine where vascular occlusion is beneficial.
