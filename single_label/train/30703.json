In the whole European Region ever forth death among 15-29 years old people is caused by alcohol over. use. The aim of the paper is to present the degree of alcohol consumption propagation among academic stu. dents in Podkarpackie, as well as estimate the occurrence of hazardous drinking. Anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted among academic students in 2010. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. There is statistical difference regarding alcohol use between women and men. Men report to drink more and more frequent. Regular alcohol use was declared by 11.9% of men and 2.3% of women. Hazardous drinking was reported by 20.7% students. Age does not statistically differ the occurrence of hazardous drinking. However, it is interesting that although among the group of 19 years old, every seventh student reports hazardous drinking, among the other groups it was reported by every fifth student. More students from urban areas (24%), than from rural areas (18%) report hazardous drinking. Students living in dormitory almost twice more frequent are at the risk of hazardous drinking (29%), than those living with parents (17%). Among female students hazardous drinking was reported by the following faculties: touristic and recreation (24%), law(13%), medical (14%) and mathematic-environmental (15%). Among men students hazardous drinking was highly reported by law and administration faculty students (33%). Among hazardous drinking students as many as 45% regularly smoke cigarettes.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466691","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.795373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.679314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.641399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.591498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.589614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.544842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.510392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Recreation","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.425669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.421499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.391104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.348024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.265536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.176092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.145929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.13498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Smoke","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"},{"name":"Lesbian","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian"},{"name":"Dormitory","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormitory"},{"name":"Pollution","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Faculty (division)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_(division)"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"}]}
