{"id":89800,"title":"Surgical planning, three-dimensional model surgery and preshaped implants in treatment of bilateral craniomaxillofacial post-traumatic deformities.","abstract":"The purpose of the present study was to explore the treatment and outcomes of bilateral craniomaxillofacial post-traumatic deformities with surgical planning, 3-dimensional (3D) model surgery, and preshaped implants.We analyzed the preoperative computed tomography (CT) data and designed preliminary surgical plans for 3 patients with bilateral craniomaxillofacial post-traumatic deformities. 3D resin skull models were produced using rapid prototyping technology, and 3D model surgery was performed to determine the location, reduction direction, and shift distance of the osteotomy and to optimize the surgical plans. Titanium plates or mesh were preshaped on the models and then implanted into the patients. The complications, symmetry of the maxillofacial regions, mouth opening, and occlusion were observed 1 month postoperatively.The patients had good recovery of their facial contour, occlusion, and mouth opening and acceptable symmetry of the bilateral maxillofacial regions. No complications were observed.The combination of surgical planning, 3D model surgery, and preshaped implants can provide surgical accuracy and efficiency and good therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of bilateral craniomaxillofacial post-traumatic deformities.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679954","annotations":[{"name":"Rapid prototyping","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_prototyping"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.64677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Oral and maxillofacial surgery","weight":0.603174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.598398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.480709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human skull","weight":0.402661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skull"},{"name":"3D modeling","weight":0.285879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.264984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.258239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prototype","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Photo identification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_identification"},{"name":"Surgical planning","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_planning"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Posttraumatic stress disorder","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Polygon mesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Energy conversion efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Lithography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
