{"id":87498,"title":"Tears of the rotator cuff. Causes--diagnosis--treatment.","abstract":"Rotator cuff ruptures are the most common degenerative tendon injury and occur mainly in older patients as multifactorial disorders manifesting the main symptoms of pain and restricted range of motion. Thorough clinical examination of the shoulder includes testing the function of the rotator cuff and leads to a tentative clinical diagnosis that is the prerequisite for diagnostic imaging procedures. Sonography of the shoulder gives rapid access to a very good sensitive overview of the rotator cuff. Conventional radiological imaging permits differential diagnosis since a reduced acromiohumeral interval is understood as a direct sign of rotator cuff rupture. The gold standard in imaging diagnostics is MRI because it not only delivers images of rotator cuff defects, but also permits interpretation of degenerative changes in the musculature. Significant pain relief can be achieved by conservative therapy such as analgesia, manual therapy and physiotherapeutic exercises and leads to improvements in the active range of motion. Persistent pain or progressive pain during conservative therapy are indications for surgical intervention. Arthroscopy-assisted treatment is tissue friendlier than open surgery and is today considered the standard for surgical treatment of rotator cuff rupture because of higher patient acceptance. Recent studies report that surgical rotator cuff repair leads to significant improvement in function, pain relief, and greater patient satisfaction. The principles of postoperative care after surgical rotator cuff repair are immobilization and gradual loading with passive and active exercises.
