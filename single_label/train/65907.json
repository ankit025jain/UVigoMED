{"id":65907,"title":"Association between the SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Several previous studies have investigated the association between the SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer in various populations. However, these results remain inconsistent. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between the SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer. An extensive literature search was performed to identify all eligible studies regarding this association. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of risk under fixed and random effects models. We identified and included eight case-control studies including 2,036 cases and 2,273 controls. No significant association was found between the SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer under the dominant model; however, those with the SULT1A1 Arg/Arg genotype had a significantly increased risk (OR = 1.218, 95 % CI = 1.067-1.392, P = 0.0044) under the recessive model. In the subgroup analysis of ethnicity, a significant association was observed in Caucasians under the recessive model (OR = 1.269, 95 % CI = 1.069-1.506, P = 0.007). Furthermore, an increased risk of bladder cancer was observed between the Arg213His polymorphism and never smokers in the recessive model (OR = 1.428, 95 % CI = 1.079-1.890, P = 0.013). The results of this meta-analysis indicate that the SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphism is associated with the risk bladder cancer under a recessive model; however, a possibly higher risk for Caucasians with the Arg/Arg genotype and never smokers needs further investigation.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763827","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.663569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.434954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.420411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.390261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.351959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.135492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Arginine","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Bladder cancer","weight":0.0332281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"392","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/392"},{"name":"428","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/428"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"890","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/890"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Random effects model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
