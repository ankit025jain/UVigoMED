{"id":54181,"title":"A polymorphism in the promoter region of the selenoprotein S gene (SEPS1) contributes to Hashimoto's thyroiditis susceptibility.","abstract":"The association between selenium and inflammation and the relevance of selenoproteins in follicular thyroid cell physiology have pointed to a putative role of selenoproteins in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases.The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of a promoter variation in SEPS1, the selenoprotein S gene, in the risk for developing Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT).A case-control study was performed to assess the association of genetic variation in the SEPS1 gene (SEPS1 -105G/A single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs28665122) and HT.The study was conducted in north Portugal, Porto, in the period of 2007-2013.A total of 997 individuals comprising 481 HT patients and 516 unrelated controls were enrolled in the study.Genetic variants were discriminated by real-time PCR using TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays.There is a significant association between the SEPS1 -105 GA and AA genotypes and HT [odds ratio (OR) 2.24, confidence interval (CI) 1.67-3.02, P < 5.0 × 10(-7), and OR 2.08, CI 1.09-3.97, P = .0268, respectively]. The A allele carriers are in higher proportion in the patient group than in the control population (46.2% vs 28.1%, P < 5.0 × 10(-7)) with an OR (CI) of 2.22 (1.67-2.97). The proportion of patients carrying the A allele is significantly higher in male patients with HT, representing a 3.94 times increased risk (P = 7.9 × 10(-3)).Our findings support the existence of a link between SEPS1 promoter genetic variation and HT risk.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24471570","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.762881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.732987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic variation","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variation"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.629535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.122191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Cell physiology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_physiology"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Thyroiditis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroiditis"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"}]}
