{"id":56663,"title":"Correlation between macular changes and the peripapillary nerve fiber layer in primary open angle glaucoma.","abstract":"Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness and the early diagnosis is crucial for treatment and follow-up in the progression of the disease.To evaluate the changes in mean macular thickness and volume and compare them with the mean thickness of the peripapillary nerve fiber layer in primary open angle glaucoma, using Time Domain (TD) optical coherence tomography ( OCT).The examinations were conducted on 275 eyes of 138 patients, as it follows: 203 eyes of 102 patients diagnosed with primary open angle glaucoma in various stages of evolution, representing the study group, and 72 normal eyes from 36 patients, representing the control group. The study was conducted from March 2010 to December 2012. All the patients gave their consent, in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The study group showed a decrease in mean macular thickness and volume, as well as mean thickness of the peripapillary nerve fiber layer (RNFL) compared to the control group. According to the OCT measurements, the results of the study have shown that the decrease of the mean thickness of the RNFL is a better differentiator between glaucomatous and normal eyes compared to the decrease of the mean macular thickness and volume.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653759","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.75333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.634308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.567093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.49183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.466486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.16711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.1401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Helsinki","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki"},{"name":"Nerve fiber","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber"},{"name":"Nerve fiber layer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber_layer"},{"name":"Declaration of Helsinki","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Helsinki"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"275","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/275"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Territorial Decoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Decoration"},{"name":"Differentiator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiator"},{"name":"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Convergence in mean","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_in_mean"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
