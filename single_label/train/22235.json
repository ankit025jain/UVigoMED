{"id":22235,"title":"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the evaluation of focal liver lesions - a prospective multicenter study of its usefulness in clinical practice.","abstract":"To assess the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for differentiating malignant from benign focal liver lesions (FLLs) and for diagnosing different FLL types.CEUS performed in 14 Romanian centers was prospectively collected between February 2011 and June 2012. The inclusion criteria were: age >?18 years; patients diagnosed with 1?-?3 de novo FLLs on B-mode ultrasound; reference method (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or biopsy) available; patient's informed consent. FLL lesions were characterized during CEUS according to the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines. For statistical analysis, indeterminate FLLs at CEUS were rated as false classifications.A total number of 536 cases were included in the final analysis, 344 malignant lesions (64.2?%) and 192 benign lesions (35.8?%). The reference method was: CT/MRI - 379 cases (70.7?%), pathological exam - 150 cases (27.9?%) and aspiration of liver abscesses - 7 cases (1.4?%). CEUS was conclusive in 89.3?% and inconclusive in 10.7?% of cases. To differentiate between malignant and benign FLLs, CEUS had 85.7?% sensitivity, 85.9?% specificity, 91.6?% positive predictive value, 77.1?% negative predictive value and 85.8?% accuracy. The CEUS accuracy for differentiation between malignant and benign liver lesions was similar in tumors with diameter ??2?cm and those with diameter >?2?cm.CEUS represents a useful method in clinical practice for differentiating between malignant and benign FLLs detected on standard ultrasonography, and the results of this study are in concordance with previous multicenter studies: DEGUM (Germany) and STIC (France).","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563420","annotations":[{"name":"Positive predictive
