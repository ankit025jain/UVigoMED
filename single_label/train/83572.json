{"id":83572,"title":"The effect of emergency department crowding on reassessment of children with critically abnormal vital signs.","abstract":"The objective was to determine whether several measures of emergency department (ED) crowding are associated with an important indicator of quality and safety: time to reevaluation of children with documented critically abnormal triage vital signs.This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all patients with critically abnormal vital signs measured in triage over a 2.5-year period (September 1, 2006, to May 1, 2009). Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to determine rate ratios for time to critically abnormal vital sign reassessment, when controlled for potential confounders.In this 2.5-year sample, 9,976 patients with critically abnormal vital signs in triage (representing 3.9% of 253,408 visits) were placed in regular ED rooms with electronic alerts prompting vital sign reassessment after 1 hour. Overall, the mean time to reassessment was 84 minutes. The rate of vital sign reassessment was reduced by 31% for each additional 10 patients waiting for admission (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98 to 0.99), by 10% for every 10 patients in the lobby (adjusted OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.93 to 0.96), and by 6% for every additional 10 patients in the overall ED census (adjusted OR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.97 to 0.98).Emergency department crowding was associated with delay in the reassessment of critically abnormal vital signs in children; further work is needed to develop systems to mitigate these delays.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308134","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.559652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Census","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Triage","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Hazard analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_analysis"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"May 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1"},{"name":"September 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_1"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"408","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/408"},{"name":"253","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/253"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"976","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/976"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"David Cox (statistician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cox_(statistician)"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Efficiency Decoration","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_Decoration"},{"name":"Lobbying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying"},{"name":"Dummy variable (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)"},{"name":"Delay (audio effect)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_(audio_effect)"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Vital signs","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs"}]}
