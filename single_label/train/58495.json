{"id":58495,"title":"Late-onset postpartum preeclampsia: a case study.","abstract":"Late-onset postpartum preeclampsia is atypical and potentially life-threatening. Diagnosis is frequently delayed because signs and symptoms of significant disease are subtle, thus, nurse practitioners should have a high index of suspicion. Immediate consultation, diagnosis, initial management, pathophysiology, and breastfeeding support are discussed as well as patient education and future health implications.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24932793","annotations":[{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Breastfeeding","weight":0.643618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.638903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Nurse practitioner","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_practitioner"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.513135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.312335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","weight":0.236645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"}]}
