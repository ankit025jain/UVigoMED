{"id":28309,"title":"Missed opportunity for alcohol problem prevention among army active duty service members postdeployment.","abstract":"We identified to what extent the Department of Defense postdeployment health surveillance program identifies at-risk drinking, alone or in conjunction with psychological comorbidities, and refers service members who screen positive for additional assessment or care.We completed a cross-sectional analysis of 333?803 US Army active duty members returning from Iraq or Afghanistan deployments in fiscal years 2008 to 2011 with a postdeployment health assessment. Alcohol measures included 2 based on self-report quantity-frequency items-at-risk drinking (positive Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test alcohol consumption questions [AUDIT-C] screen) and severe alcohol problems (AUDIT-C score of 8 or higher)-and another based on the interviewing provider's assessment.Nearly 29% of US Army active duty members screened positive for at-risk drinking, and 5.6% had an AUDIT-C score of 8 or higher. Interviewing providers identified potential alcohol problems among only 61.8% of those screening positive for at-risk drinking and only 74.9% of those with AUDIT-C scores of 8 or higher. They referred for a follow-up visit to primary care or another setting only 29.2% of at-risk drinkers and only 35.9% of those with AUDIT-C scores of 8 or higher.This study identified missed opportunities for early intervention for at-risk drinking. Future research should evaluate the effect of early intervention on long-term outcomes.","date":"2014-07-12","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922163","annotations":[{"name":"Iraq","weight":0.844339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"},{"name":"Afghanistan","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"},{"name":"United States Department of Defense","weight":0.783309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"United States Armed Forces","weight":0.60711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.596879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.58421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"United States Army","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.473836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.368093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.30333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.221605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Active duty","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_Use_Disorders_Identification_Test"},{"name":"NSA warrantless surveillance controversy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Army","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"}]}
