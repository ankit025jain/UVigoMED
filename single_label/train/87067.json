{"id":87067,"title":"European survey on laboratory preparedness, response and diagnostic capacity for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, 2012.","abstract":"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an infectious viral disease that has (re-)emerged in the last decade in south-eastern Europe, and there is a risk for further geographical expansion to western Europe. Here we report the results of a survey covering 28 countries, conducted in 2012 among the member laboratories of the European Network for Diagnostics of 'Imported' Viral Diseases (ENIVD) to assess laboratory preparedness and response capacities for CCHF. The answers of 31 laboratories of the European region regarding CCHF case definition, training necessity, biosafety, quality assurance and diagnostic tests are presented. In addition, we identified the lack of a Regional Reference Expert Laboratory in or near endemic areas. Moreover, a comprehensive review of the biosafety level suitable to the reality of endemic areas is needed. These issues are challenges that should be addressed by European public health authorities. However, all respondent laboratories have suitable diagnostic capacities for the current situation.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25011064","annotations":[{"name":"Fever","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.602939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.557171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endemic (epidemiology)","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.355157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Biosafety level","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.298912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Western Europe","weight":0.297438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.293744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Biosafety","weight":0.221708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Viral hemorrhagic fever","weight":0.0269276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hemorrhagic_fever"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Western (genre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)"},{"name":"Emergency management","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management"},{"name":"Balkans","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Quality assurance","weight":0.0138715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance"}]}
