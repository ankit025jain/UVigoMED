{"id":40817,"title":"Gender-specific differences in depression and anxiety symptoms and help-seeking behavior among gastroenterology patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","abstract":"To evaluate the gender-specific difference in the prevalence of depression and anxiety and the help-seeking behavior among gastroenterology outpatients.A cross-sectional study was carried out in gastroenterology clinics in 4 hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between February and September 2013. A self-administrated questionnaire was developed and administered to patients. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires were used to identify depression and anxiety.A total of 438 patients completed the study questionnaire; 135 (31%) females, and 303 (69%) males. Compared with males, females had more depression symptoms (44% versus 32%, p=0.012), anxiety symptoms (34% versus 24%, p=0.036), anxiety-associated difficulty (65% versus 52%, p=0.012), but similar suicidal thoughts (14% versus 11%, p=0.347). Females had similar gastrointestinal complaints but longer duration of symptoms. In both females and males, the most common first interventions were using medications (63% versus 69%), and undergoing endoscopy (19% versus 15%), while very few patients initially used herbs or Islamic incantation `Roquia` (7% versus 8%). Compared with males, females were more likely to subsequently seek help at private clinics (23% versus 14%, p=0.014), or with a Quran therapist (11% versus 5%, p=0.012).There are clear gender-specific differences in depression and anxiety symptoms and associated perceived difficulty, but modest differences in help-seeking behavior. Female patients at the gastroenterology clinic may deserve more psychological attention to diagnose depression and anxiety and to alleviate their impact.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983282","annotations":[{"name":"Generalized anxiety disorder","weight":0.846848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Anxiety disorder","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Saudi Arabia","weight":0.80103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.775647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Quran","weight":0.760937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.692933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.681323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.648285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.569226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Islam","weight":0.491377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.379473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Suicidal ideation","weight":0.316462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation"},{"name":"Herb","weight":0.159122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0435955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Riyadh","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh"},{"name":"Patient Health Questionnaire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Health_Questionnaire"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Arabian Peninsula","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Incantation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantation"}]}
