{"id":7747,"title":"Assessing motor outcome and functional recovery following nerve injury.","abstract":"Behavioral tests significantly contribute to our understanding of nerve function after experimental lesions and/or therapeutic intervention. In particular, the rat sciatic nerve has proven to be a valuable animal model to study nerve injury and repair. Here, we describe how to optimally use the commercially available CatWalk system to obtain a detailed and objective analysis of dynamic and static gait parameters.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838968","annotations":[{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.689429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.137589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Sciatic nerve","weight":0.103079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_nerve"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Static electricity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_electricity"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
