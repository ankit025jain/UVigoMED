{"id":72478,"title":"Initially localized synovial sarcoma in adults: a retrospective single-center analysis of 26 patients registered at the Department of Oncology, University of Vienna between 2004 and 2013.","abstract":"Synovial sarcoma is a rare subgroup of all soft-tissue sarcomas. The aim of this retrospective single-center analysis was to investigate the outcome of patients with initially localized disease.Twenty-six patients were enrolled in this retrospective single-center analysis. Baseline characteristics, treatment and outcome were evaluated.In 13 patients (50%), the tumor was located in the lower extremity and in 4 patients (15%) in the upper extremity. Surgical resection was done in all but 2 patients (92%). Re-resection was done in 7 patients (27%). Fourteen patients (54%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 23.3 months (range: 2.6-150.3), median disease-free survival was not reached at the time of analysis. Eight patients (31%) relapsed after initial therapy. Surgery was done in 2 patients, amputation in 1 patient, palliative chemotherapy was administered in 3 and radiation therapy in 2 patients. Median overall survival (OS) for all patients was not reached at the time of analysis. The estimated 5-year OS rate was 62%.Patients with initially localized synovial sarcoma who were included in this retrospective single-center analysis have an estimated 5-year OS rate of 62%.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24969357","annotations":[{"name":"Synovial sarcoma","weight":0.913295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_sarcoma"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.809594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.68182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.64922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.519125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.374958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"University of Vienna","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna"},{"name":"Vienna","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Synovial membrane","weight":0.148686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_membrane"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Range (particle radiation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(particle_radiation)"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"}]}
