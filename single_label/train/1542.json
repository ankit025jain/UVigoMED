{"id":1542,"title":"Physiopathological and therapeutical correlations in alcohol dependence.","abstract":"No doubt, alcoholism represents nowadays the toxicomany with the highest expansion rate among all population groups, being recognized by the specialists from the medical, social, economic and legal field as a true \"toxic pandemy\". Researchers consider ethanol, this small but highly aggressive molecule, to have supremacy if we were to consider the number of pages dedicated to it worldwide on daily bases, in the medical or any other specialty literature. Nonetheless, the large volume of data regarding ethanol toxicity does not seen to simplify things, on the contrary it points out new information about the its negative effects on human body. Ethanol represents a toxic that is rapidly and completely absorbed in the intestinal tract being distributed to most tissues and organs; ethanol is recognized as an enzymatic inductor of its own metabolization but also of the metabolization of numerous therapeutic agents.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341287","annotations":[{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.733597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.69293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.675453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.509932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.457338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.216493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.167804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Inductor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Thermal expansion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
