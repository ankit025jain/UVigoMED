{"id":36645,"title":"Differential effects of low-phenylalanine protein sources on brain neurotransmitters and behavior in C57Bl/6-Pah(enu2) mice.","abstract":"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which metabolizes phenylalanine (phe) to tyrosine. A low-phe diet plus amino acid (AA) formula is necessary to prevent cognitive impairment; glycomacropeptide (GMP) contains minimal phe and provides a palatable alternative to the AA formula. Our objective was to assess neurotransmitter concentrations in the brain and the behavioral phenotype of PKU mice (Pah(enu2) on the C57Bl/6 background) and how this is affected by low-phe protein sources. Wild type (WT) and PKU mice, both male and female, were fed high-phe casein, low-phe AA, or low-phe GMP diets between 3 and 18 weeks of age. Behavioral phenotype was assessed using the open field and marble burying tests, and brain neurotransmitter concentrations were measured using HPLC with electrochemical detection system. Data were analyzed by 3-way ANOVA with genotype, sex, and diet as the main treatment effects. Brain mass and the concentrations of catecholamines and serotonin were reduced in PKU mice compared to WT mice; the low-phe AA and GMP diets improved these parameters in PKU mice. Relative brain mass was increased in female PKU mice fed the GMP diet compared to the AA diet. PKU mice exhibited hyperactivity and impaired vertical exploration compared to their WT littermates during the open field test. Regardless of genotype or diet, female mice demonstrated increased vertical activity time and increased total ambulatory and horizontal activity counts compared with male mice. PKU mice fed the high-phe casein diet buried significantly fewer marbles than WT control mice fed casein; this was normalized in PKU mice fed the low-phe AA and GMP diets. In summary, C57Bl/6-Pah(enu2) mice showed an impaired behavioral phenotype and reduced brain neurotransmitter concentrations that were improved by the low-phe AA or GMP diets. These data support lifelong adherence to a low-phe diet for PKU.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
