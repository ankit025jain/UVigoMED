{"id":89315,"title":"Refinements and secondary surgery after flap reconstruction of the traumatized hand.","abstract":"The traumatized hand often has soft tissue loss requiring flap reconstruction. Before proceeding with flap selection, the need for future refinement and secondary surgery should be taken into consideration. Although muscle flaps may offer better contour, fasciocutaneous flaps allow easier secondary flap elevation. After the initial flap reconstruction, indications for secondary procedures may be managed according to tissue type: bone, joint, tendon, nerve, and soft tissue.
