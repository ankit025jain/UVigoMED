{"id":36300,"title":"Aortopulmonary window: a single institution surgical experience.","abstract":"Aortopulmonary window is a rare cardiac anomaly. We report our experience with this rare lesion and highlight the criteria for treating this defect without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.From May 2007 to April 2012, 10 patients, aged 1 to 10 months and weighing 3.4 to 5.5 kg, were operated on by a single surgeon using both off-pump and standard techniques. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative echocardiographic assessment, and were followed up with clinical examinations and echocardiography.There was no operative death and all patients were alive at the last follow-up. No major morbidities were noted. Two cases were operated on off-pump and they had shorter intensive care unit stays. All patients were in New York Heart Association class I on follow-up, with no residual shunt noted in follow-up echocardiograms.The surgical closure of aortopulmonary window carries a low surgical risk. Early surgical closure prevents the development of pulmonary vascular disease and achieves good immediate and long-term outcomes. Off-pump repair techniques, when used judiciously, have a place in the treatment of this defect.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585901","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.44266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.421392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.344566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Vascular disease","weight":0.327954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_disease"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.319308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"York","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"New York Heart Association Functional Classification","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Heart_Association_Functional_Classification"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
