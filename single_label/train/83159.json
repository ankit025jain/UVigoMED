{"id":83159,"title":"[Russian dental implants system LIKO-M - 5 years clinical experience].","abstract":"The study focuses on long term results of restorative treatment with dental implant system Liko-M. The study included 503 patients examined and 274 patients treated aged 20-69 with partial or complete teeth loss. The patients were examined and treated at the Department of Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery of Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy and in 4 dental practices in Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod. Two-staged implantation method was applied. The treatment met esthetic and functional requirements. Marginal bone resorption was estimated as 0,1 to 1 mm within 5 years follow-up. LIKO-M dental implant system thus proved to be efficient both esthetically and functionally and may be used for compete oral rehabilitation of edentulous patients.
