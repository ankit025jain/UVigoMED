{"id":75987,"title":"What is the clinical relevance of in vitro epileptiform activity?","abstract":"In vitro preparations provide an exceptionally rapid, flexible, and accessible approach to long-standing problems in epilepsy research including ictogenesis, epileptogenesis, and drug resistance. Acute slices suffer from a reduction in network connectivity that has traditionally been compensated through the application of acute convulsants. The utility and limitations of this approach have become clear over time and are discussed here. Other approaches such as organotypic slice preparations demonstrate the full spectrum of spontaneous epileptic activity and more closely mimic human responses to anticonvulsants, including the development of drug resistance. Newly developed transgenic and vector expression systems for fluorophores, optogenetics, and orphan receptors are being coupled with advances in imaging and image analysis. These developments have created the capacity to rapidly explore many new avenues of epilepsy research such as vascular, astrocytic and mitochondrial contributions to epileptogenesis. Rigorous study design as well as close collaboration with in vivo laboratories and clinical investigators will accelerate the translation of the exciting discoveries that will be revealed by these new techniques.
