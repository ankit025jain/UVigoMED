{"id":62278,"title":"[MyD88 L265P mutation and B cell tumor].","abstract":"Myeloid differentiation factor (MyD88) is an important adaptor protein mediating the signal transduction of most Toll-like receptors (TLR), interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and interleukin-18 receptor (IL-18R) that play a key role to mediate innate immune response. Recently, activating of MYD88 L265 mutation has been reported in about of 90% lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenstr√∂m's Macroglobulinemia, about of 29% activated type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other subtypes of B cell tumors demonstrating the MyD88 signaling plays an important role in B cell tumorigenesis, and inhibitors targeting MyD88 might become a new remedy for B cell tumors. In this review, the latest advances in the roles of MyD88 L265P mutation in B cell tumorigenesis were summarized.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598687","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Myd88","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myd88"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.809594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.717209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.651115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.586821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Toll-like receptor","weight":0.555739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor"},{"name":"Interleukin 18","weight":0.370578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_18"},{"name":"Macroglobulinemia","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroglobulinemia"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Adapter","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"}]}
