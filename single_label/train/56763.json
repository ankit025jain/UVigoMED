{"id":56763,"title":"Quantitative analysis of cone photoreceptor distribution and its relationship with axial length, age, and early age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"It has not been clarified whether early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is associated with cone photoreceptor distribution. We used adaptive optics fundus camera to examine cone photoreceptors in the macular area of aged patients and quantitatively analyzed its relationship between the presence of early AMD and cone distribution.Sixty cases aged 50 or older were studied. The eyes were examined with funduscopy and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography to exclude the eyes with any abnormalities at two sites of measurement, 2° superior and 5° temporal to the fovea. High-resolution retinal images with cone photoreceptor mosaic were obtained with adaptive optics fundus camera (rtx1, Imagine Eyes, France). After adjusting for axial length, cone packing density was calculated and the relationship with age, axial length, or severity of early AMD based on the age-related eye disease study (AREDS) classification was analyzed.Patient's age ranged from 50 to 77, and axial length from 21.7 to 27.5 mm. Mean density in metric units and that in angular units were 24,900 cells/mm2, 2,170 cells/deg2 at 2° superior, and 18,500 cells/mm2, 1,570 cels/deg2 at 5° temporal, respectively. Axial length was significantly correlated with the density calculated in metric units, but not with that in angular units. Age was significantly correlated with the density both in metric and angular units at 2° superior. There was no significant difference in the density in metric and angular units between the eyes with AREDS category one and those with categories two or three.Axial length and age were significantly correlated with parafoveal cone photoreceptor distribution. The results do not support that early AMD might influence cone photoreceptor density in the area without drusen or pigment abnormalities.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24632778","annotations":[{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.862755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Fovea centralis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis"},{"name":"Adaptive optics","weight":0.778698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics"},{"name":"Photoreceptor cell","weight":0.774507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"},{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Camera","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.681644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Cone cell","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.399804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.336651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"France","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.225598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Eye disease","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_disease"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mosaic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic"},{"name":"Fundus camera","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_camera"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"International System of Units","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Probability distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Age-Related Eye Disease Study","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age-Related_Eye_Disease_Study"},{"name":"Drusen","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drusen"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
