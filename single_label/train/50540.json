{"id":50540,"title":"Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer: from standard chemotherapy to promising molecular pathway targets--where are we now?","abstract":"Ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological malignancy in the Western countries, and differences in outcome among different histological subtypes are being increasingly recognized. It is generally considered as chemosensitive, but resistant clones evolve in the majority of cases, at varying rates. In this brief review, we describe advances in conventional chemotherapy, particularly the use of weekly paclitaxel. We then focus on new promising agents that target certain pathways which drive the genesis and evolution of ovarian cancer; these include poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors targeting tumor cells deficient in homologous recombination. We also discuss other targets including the folate receptor. Ovarian cancer has also proved to be one of the most sensitive types of cancer to an anti-angiogenic approach and we summarize recent experience using a range of agents.
