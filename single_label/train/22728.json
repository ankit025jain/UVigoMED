{"id":22728,"title":"[Initial resuscitation bundle and monitoring tissue perfusion in severe sepsis].","abstract":"Sepsis is a global health problem. Despite recent advances in understanding its pathophysiology and clinical trials testing potential new therapies, mortality remains unacceptably high. In fact, sepsis is the leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units around the world. However, during the past decade, some studies have highlighted that early recognition of sepsis and an appropriate initial approach are fundamental determinants of prognosis. A systematic approach to the harmful triad of sepsis-related hypotension, tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction, with low-cost, easy to implement, and effective interventions, can significantly improve the chances of survival. In this article, we will update the evidence supporting the initial resuscitation bundle for patients with severe sepsis, and discuss the physiological basis for perfusion monitoring during septic shock resuscitation.
