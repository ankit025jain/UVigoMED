{"id":20578,"title":"[New therapeutic strategies against Helicobacter pylori].","abstract":"The standard therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in Korea is a triple-drug regimen consisting of a proton pump inhibitor with two antibiotics such as clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. However, as the eradication rate of this regimen has declined over the past decade, this prompted the formulation of new therapeutic regimens. New therapeutic strategies against H. pylori infection that had been tried all over the world include sequential therapy, concomitant therapy, and tailored therapy This article will review the basic concepts and the results of previous clinical trials on the aforementioned new therapeutic regiments.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651587","annotations":[{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Metronidazole","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metronidazole"},{"name":"Amoxicillin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"},{"name":"Clarithromycin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarithromycin"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.849187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.535634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Korea","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Regiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Smallpox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"}]}
