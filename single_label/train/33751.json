{"id":33751,"title":"Complete neurologic recovery in an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest facilitated by initiation of therapeutic hypothermia in a young athlete with an anomalous right coronary artery.","abstract":"Therapeutic hypothermia is an accepted modality for improving neurologic outcome in patients who have sustained cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation. Despite postresuscitative neuroprotection, it is uncommon to have patients who have undergone prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation to recover full neurologic function. An unusual case of sudden cardiac arrest in a young athlete with an anomolous right coronary artery is presented.
