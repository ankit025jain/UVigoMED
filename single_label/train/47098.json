{"id":47098,"title":"[Evaluation of seroconversion after vaccination of medical staff against HBV infection].","abstract":"Carry out analysis of formation of immune response in vaccinated medical staff against viral hepatitis B, detect risk factors by lack of seroconversion after vaccination.In medical staff (49 individuals) retrospective analysis of dynamics of antibody titers against HBsAg (aHBs) after vaccination in 1998-2011, data on objective status and main laboratory parameters based on medical documentation was carried out.Among vaccinated the lack of response (aHBs < 10 mIU/ml) was observed in 20.4%, weak response (aHBs > or = 10 mIU/ml, < 100 mIU/ml)--in 34.7% and full response (aHBs > or = 100 mIU/ml)--in 44.9% of staff. Age over 40 years, male gender, obesity and insulin-resistance were linked with ineffectiveness of vaccination. With aHBs < 100 mIU/ml titers the patients became seornegative within 3 years after the immunization. With aHBs > or = 100 mIU/ml titers the patients remained seropositive for 10 years.Age over 40 years, male gender, obesity and insulin-resistance are linked with lack of formation of seroconversion after vaccination against HBV infection. When immune response is weak early monitoring of HBV titers is necessary with the aim of timely execution of revaccination. When immune response is adequate, revaccination is possible in 10 years.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605657","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.763957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.705099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.644246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.597988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.527932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.500812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Serostatus","weight":0.495666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serostatus"},{"name":"Seroconversion","weight":0.282949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroconversion"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.256982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.228575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Health informatics","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Dynamical system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system"}]}
