{"id":33788,"title":"Semilunar valve replacement with decellularized homograft after Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis and fontan procedure.","abstract":"We describe a patient in whom severe neoaortic (anatomic pulmonary) valve regurgitation developed lateÂ after Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis and Fontan operation. The valve was replaced with a fresh decellularized homograft, which we developed and applied in the normal pulmonary and aortic position in more than 100 patients. During follow-up of more than 2 years, the valve function is excellent, and no infectious or thromboembolic complications were seen. The decellularized homograft seems to be an ideal material in this situation.
