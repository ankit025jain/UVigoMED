{"id":22639,"title":"Intravenous thrombolysis is unsafe in stroke due to infective endocarditis.","abstract":"Embolic stroke is the most common neurological complication of infective endocarditis and a major source of morbidity and mortality. Septic embolism is considered a contraindication to intravenous thrombolysis in patients with ischaemic stroke because of concerns over an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage. We describe a patient with occult endocarditis who was treated with thrombolysis for acute stroke and review other cases reported in the literature.
