{"id":92588,"title":"Optimizing success with lumbar disc arthroplasty.","abstract":"This study aimed at determining the variables that may prove useful in predicting clinical outcomes following lumbar disc arthroplasty.Pre- and post-operative imaging assessments were obtained for 99 single-level lumbar disc arthroplasty patients from a prospective IDE study. The assessments and patient demographics were tested to identify variables that were significantly associated with clinical outcomes.Clinical outcome data were available for 85 % of patients at the 5-year follow-up. Numerous assessments made from the pre-operative imaging were found to have statistically significant associations with clinical outcomes at 2 and 5 years. The most notable factors were related to the amount of degeneration at the index level, with patients achieving better outcome scores at 5 years if they have higher grades of degeneration preoperatively.Several variables may prove effective at optimizing clinical outcomes including a preoperative disc height <8 mm, Modic type 2 changes adjacent to the target disc, a low amount of lordosis present at the treatment level, low levels of fatty replacement of the paraspinal musculature, a prominent amount of facet joint or disc degeneration, and the presence of flat or convex vertebral endplates. There were also post-operative findings associated with better patient outcomes including a larger percent of the endplate covered with the implant, larger implant heights, greater increases in disc space heights, and a larger increase in index level lumbar lordosis. These variables could be explored in other clinical studies to facilitate meta-analyses that could identify effective strategies to optimize clinical outcomes with lumbar disc arthroplasty.","date":"2014-09-27","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24770556","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.679772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.567912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.129581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.119851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Zygapophysial joint","weight":0.106006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygapophysial_joint"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Integrated development environment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment"},{"name":"Lordosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordosis"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Longissimus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longissimus"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Flat racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_racing"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"}]}
