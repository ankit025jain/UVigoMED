{"id":53882,"title":"[Influence of EphA2 siRNA transfection on the biological behavior of human ovarian carcinoma cell].","abstract":"To explore EphA2 siRNA transfection and its influence on the biological behavior of human ovarian carcinoma cells.One pairs of siRNA was synthesized and transfected into the human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3. Observation of the transfection efficiency through the fluorescence inverted microscope was followed by the evaluation of expression of EphA2 protein using Western blot. The effects of EphA2 siRNA on proliferation of SKOV3 cells were observed by drawing cell growth curves and measuring cloning efficiency, and the adhesion and invasion of SKOV3 were detected by cell adhesion assay and Matrigel-boyden chamber method respectively.After successful transfection, a large number of fluorescent particles were observed under the fluorescence inverted microscope. The expression of EphA2 protein was obviously suppressed by EphA2 siRNA (P < 0.05). The cell proliferation, adhesiveness and invasiveness were significantly inhibited (P < 0.05). However, no changes in colony-forming efficiency were observed (P > 0.05).Down-regulation of EphA2 gene by EphA2 siRNA in SKOV3 cell line showed retardation of cell growth, proliferation and partial reversion of the malignant phenotype, including the ability of adhesion and invasion. EphA2 may be a new and potent target of gene therapy in ovarian carcinoma.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490493","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Gene therapy","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.773461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.770479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.759404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.748228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.739073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.724129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.610653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.604628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.555683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.463177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.32381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.257706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.205308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.156579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"EPH receptor A2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPH_receptor_A2"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Drawing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing"},{"name":"Inverted repeat","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_repeat"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Subatomic particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
