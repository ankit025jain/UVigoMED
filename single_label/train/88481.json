{"id":88481,"title":"Comparison of serum lipoprotein (a) level between non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"Numerous studies have reported higher lipoprotein (a) levels among stroke patients than controls, but it could be due to an acute phase reaction. The aim of this study was to compare lipoprotein (a) levels between patients with ischemic stroke and those with traumatic brain injury.In this case control study from February 2010 to September 2010, 43 patients with traumatic brain injury and 48 patients with ischemic stroke aged above 45 years who had a neurologic attack and attended to hospital in less than 3 days were enrolled in the study. Demographic data were registered and lab tests such as lipoprotein (a) were done. The control group was patients with significant head trauma. Blood specimens were taken in less than 72 hours after admission.91 patients were enrolled (43 with head trauma (female/male: 15/28, age: 39.17 +/- 19.3 years) and 48 with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke (female/male: 30/18, age: 67.19 +/- 12.65 years)). In patients with stroke, there were no correlations between patients' age and gender with lipoprotein (a) levels. Lipoprotein (a) was significantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke than patients with head trauma (p = 0.012).The present study demonstrated that lipoprotein (a) level is significantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke than in patients with head trauma and the relation is not related to its inflammatory action.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839811","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.867542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.780859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Ischemic stroke","weight":0.706682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemic_stroke"},{"name":"Head injury","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury"},{"name":"Acute-phase protein","weight":0.677403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute-phase_protein"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.321708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.238196,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.143187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Case-control study","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"1528","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1528"},{"name":"Aircraft registration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"}]}
