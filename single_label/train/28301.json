{"id":28301,"title":"[Use of Nadis(®) software to improve adverse drug reaction reporting of antiretroviral drugs: experience in south west of France (midi-pyrénées)].","abstract":"To study the value of the module of pharmacovigilance in Nadis® to improve the antiretroviral (ARV) drugs-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reporting.We collected the ADRs reported for 17 months from November 2010 until April 2012. Following data were recorded: characteristics of patients, ADRs, ARV drugs. The number of ADRs was compared to those collected in the same period (17 months) before use of Nadis®.The 119 ADRs reported (an increase of 183%) for 109 patients ADRs were mainly gastrointestinal (21.8%) followed by renal (20.2%), neuro-psychiatric (16.8%), hepatic (13.5%), cutaneous (8.4%), metabolic (6.7%) and others (12.6%). The repartition of ARV drugs was: nucleoside (31.8%), nucleotide (13.6%) reverse transcriptase inhibitors respectively, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (13.1%), protease inhibitors (36.4%), and integrase inhibitors (5.1%).Our results show the improvement of ARV-induced ADRs reporting by Nadis® which could be used to reduce the rate of under-reporting in patients exposed to these drugs.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926633","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.889143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Reverse transcriptase","weight":0.848396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Nucleoside","weight":0.742055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","weight":0.705309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor","weight":0.695053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-transcriptase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Pharmacovigilance","weight":0.649292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance"},{"name":"Integrase","weight":0.379971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.289084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"France","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.238329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Integrase inhibitor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"}]}
