{"id":81197,"title":"New method to increase inter-alveolar height with preservation of crestal cortical bone for implant treatment.","abstract":"The aim of this technique is to provide adequate interocclusal distance (3 mm) allowing preprosthetic management. A bone block was cut with piezosurgery and extracted, leaving the crestal cortical bone intact. The free crestal alveolar bone was fixed to the maxilla with 2 dental implants. After 3 months of follow-up, abutment surgery was performed and osseointegration was evident with adequate interocclusal height (7 mm) allowing prosthetic management.
