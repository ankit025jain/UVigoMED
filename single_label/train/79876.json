{"id":79876,"title":"The usefulness of DNA derived from third stage larvae in the detection of Ashworthius sidemi infection in European bison, by a simple polymerase chain reaction.","abstract":"Ashworthius sidemi, a blood-sucking nematode, is a primary parasite of Asiatic cervides, primarily sika deer (Cervus nippon). As A. sidemi infections are common in bison, red and roe deer, and gastrointestinal nematodes are often exchanged between animals, it is possible that other farm animals such as cows and sheep that may use the same pastures can be infected. Hence, histopathological changes observed in the walls of the abomasa and duodena of infected wildlife caused by a strong parasite presence may become an important health problem also for farm animals.In the present study, a simple PCR test for the detection of A. sidemi infection in European bison based on DNA from third stage infective larvae (L3) has been optimized.The species-specific primers generated a 406 bp fragment, and A. sidemi DNA could be detected at concentrations of 0.1 pg/?l. The specificity of PCR was confirmed by the use of the genomic DNA of adult Ostertagia ostertagi, Haemonchus contortus, Cooperia oncophora as negative controls.It is possible to detect A. sidemi infection in European bison using DNA from L3. If this nematode infection is transmitted to cows this method may be effective to diagnose invasion in breeding animals in vivo.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886355","annotations":[{"name":"Nematode","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Deer","weight":0.756512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Wildlife","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.669005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.622715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.541595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Wisent","weight":0.456468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisent"},{"name":"Bison","weight":0.379732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison"},{"name":"Roe Deer","weight":0.371491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_Deer"},{"name":"Sika Deer","weight":0.320962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sika_Deer"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.306224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Haemonchus contortus","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemonchus_contortus"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.159122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Strongylida","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongylida"},{"name":"Pasture","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Red","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"},{"name":"Roe","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Cervus","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervus"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Old-growth forest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
