{"id":62674,"title":"Human leukocyte antigen-DO regulates surface presentation of human leukocyte antigen class II-restricted antigens on B cell malignancies.","abstract":"Hematological malignancies often express surface HLA class II, making them attractive targets for CD4+ T cell therapy. We previously demonstrated that HLA class II ligands can be divided into DM-resistant and DM-sensitive antigens. In contrast to presentation of DM-resistant antigens, presentation of DM-sensitive antigens is suppressed by HLA-DM but can be rescued by HLA-DO. We also showed that HLA-DO expression remains low in nonhematopoietic cells under inflammatory conditions, suggesting that DM-sensitive antigens may be ideal T cell targets with a low risk for graft-versus-host disease. Here, we demonstrated that B cell malignancies often express HLA-DO and that levels are in particular high in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, we showed that surface presentation of DM-sensitive antigens is regulated by HLA-DO, and that DM-sensitive antigens are relevant T cell targets for B cell malignancies and, especially, chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These data open the perspective to target HLA class II ligands with specific processing and presentation behavior for CD4+ T cell therapy of hematological malignancies.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530695","annotations":[{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Hematological malignancy","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematological_malignancy"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.843572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.820887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.809809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.760551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.715272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.590954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Ligand","weight":0.489781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
