{"id":54685,"title":"Anti-inflammatory therapy after selective laser trabeculoplasty: a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial.","abstract":"To investigate the effect of anti-inflammatory therapy on selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) outcomes.Randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial.Patients with primary open-angle or pseudo-exfoliation glaucoma.Patients undergoing SLT were randomized to receive placebo (artificial tears), prednisolone acetate 1%, or ketorolac tromethamine 0.5% eye drops 4 times per day for 5 days commencing immediately after SLT.Change in intraocular pressure (IOP) from baseline to the 1-month post-SLT visit.Mean change in IOP at the 1-month primary outcome time point, as well as all other time points, was not significantly different among groups (P = 0.99). Likewise, a repeated-measures, mixed-effects model did not find significant differences in IOP outcome at the 1-month time point (P = 0.95). The IOP was reduced in all groups at the 1-month post-SLT time point and all other time points, and no significant differences were found between groups using separate unadjusted cross-sectional analyses of variance (P > 0.15 for analyses at all time points). Treatment failure rates were not different among groups (P = 0.75), and at 1 year after SLT, the percentage of patients maintaining a 20% IOP reduction ranged from 18% to 22% in the 3 study groups.Anti-inflammatory therapy after SLT does not seem to substantially influence the IOP-lowering effect of SLT. In this study of patients with low baseline IOP, SLT showed limited efficacy in achieving a sustained reduction in IOP.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25234015","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.878899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.770731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.687218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Ketorolac","weight":0.683357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketorolac"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.656375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.550483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.512701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.400526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.108234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Acetate","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate"},{"name":"Tris","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tris"},{"name":"Pseudoexfoliation syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoexfoliation_syndrome"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Comparison of birth control methods","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_birth_control_methods"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Artificial tears","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_tears"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"IBM Solid Logic Technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Solid_Logic_Technology"}]}
