{"id":63056,"title":"Response evaluation and monitoring of multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Monitoring multiple myeloma (MM) is essential during the evaluation of response to each therapy line, after transplantation and at the time of relapse or progression in all patients. An initial complete workup, including appropriate protein studies in serum and urine is mandatory. The use of uniform criteria is particularly important in the context of clinical trials. Complete remission (CR) definition, the goal for the majority of patients, is now in constant evolution, with immunophenotypic and molecular minimal residual disease measurement in bone marrow as well as imaging techniques. Identification of relapse/progression with traditional and novel techniques for eventual prompt intervention with rescue treatment is a current issue of debate.
