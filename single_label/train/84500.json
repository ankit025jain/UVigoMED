{"id":84500,"title":"Fine mapping major histocompatibility complex associations in psoriasis and its clinical subtypes.","abstract":"Psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) risk is strongly associated with variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, but its genetic architecture has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we conducted a large-scale fine-mapping study of PsV risk in the MHC region in 9,247 PsV-affected individuals and 13,589 controls of European descent by imputing class I and II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes from SNP genotype data. In addition, we imputed sequence variants for MICA, an MHC HLA-like gene that has been associated with PsV, to evaluate association at that locus as well. We observed that HLA-C(?)06:02 demonstrated the lowest p value for overall PsV risk (p = 1.7 × 10(-364)). Stepwise analysis revealed multiple HLA-C(?)06:02-independent risk variants in both class I and class II HLA genes for PsV susceptibility (HLA-C(?)12:03, HLA-B amino acid positions 67 and 9, HLA-A amino acid position 95, and HLA-DQ?1 amino acid position 53; p < 5.0 × 10(-8)), but no apparent risk conferred by MICA. We further evaluated risk of two major clinical subtypes of PsV, psoriatic arthritis (PsA; n = 3,038) and cutaneous psoriasis (PsC; n = 3,098). We found that risk heterogeneity between PsA and PsC might be driven by HLA-B amino acid position 45 (Pomnibus = 2.2 × 10(-11)), indicating that different genetic factors underlie the overall risk of PsV and the risk of specific PsV subphenotypes. Our study illustrates the value of high-resolution HLA and MICA imputation for fine mapping causal variants in the MHC.","date":"2014-08-09","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087609","annotations":[{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Psoriasis","weight":0.878028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis"},{"name":"Psoriatic arthritis","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriatic_arthritis"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.775131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.459327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.432067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.271132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"MHC class I","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"},{"name":"Histocompatibility","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histocompatibility"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.240912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"P-value","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"},{"name":"MHC class II","weight":0.204876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_II"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Architecture","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Ethnic groups in Europe","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Genetic architecture","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_architecture"}]}
