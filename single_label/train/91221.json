{"id":91221,"title":"Fecal continence following complex anorectal trauma in children.","abstract":"Complex injuries involving the anus and rectum are uncommon in children. We sought to examine long-term fecal continence following repair of these injuries.We conducted a retrospective review using our trauma registry from 2003 to 2012 of children with traumatic injuries to the anus or rectum at a level I pediatric trauma center. Patients with an injury requiring surgical repair that involved the anal sphincters and/or rectum were selected for a detailed review.Twenty-one patients (21/13,149 activations, 0.2%) who had an injury to the anus (n=9), rectum (n=8), or destructive injury to both the anus and rectum (n=4) were identified. Eleven (52%) patients were male, and the median age at time of injury was 9 (range 1-14) years. Penetrating trauma accounted for 48% of injuries. Three (14%) patients had accompanying injury to the urinary tract, and 6 (60%) females had vaginal injuries. All patients with an injury involving the rectum and destructive anal injuries were managed with fecal diversion. No patient with an isolated anal injury underwent fecal diversion. Four (19%) patients developed wound infections. The majority (90%) of patients were continent at last follow-up. One patient who sustained a gunshot injury to the pelvis with sacral nerve involvement is incontinent, but remains artificially clean on an intense bowel management program with enemas, and one patient with a destructive crush injury still has a colostomy.With anatomic reconstruction of the anal sphincter mechanism, most patients with traumatic anorectal injuries will experience long-term fecal continence. Follow-up is needed as occasionally these patients, specifically those with nerve or crush injury, may require a formal bowel management program.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528984","annotations":[{"name":"Fecal incontinence","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Colostomy","weight":0.817475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colostomy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.794664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Sacrum","weight":0.785161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Penetrating trauma","weight":0.748891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrating_trauma"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.736829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Enema","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enema"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.538221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.29276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Ballistic trauma","weight":0.236621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trauma"},{"name":"Continent","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0983743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.056272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Sacral nerves","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacral_nerves"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Limerence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"}]}
