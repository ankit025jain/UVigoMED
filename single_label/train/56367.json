{"id":56367,"title":"[Pathophysiology of myopia: nature versus nurture].","abstract":"Myopia is the most frequent refractive disorder in the world. It has become a real Public Health problem, due to its frequency and to high myopia-related blinding complications. Myopic progression depends on genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have identified more than forty candidate genes that take part in pathophysiological pathways, from retinal phototransduction to axial lengthening via scleral remodelling. Environmental factors also influence scleral remodelling by way of visual perception. In the case of predominant attention to near tasks, a physiological feedback loop leads to axial growth. This phenomenon, called active emmetropization, is particularly obvious in animal models and in some human populations. To date, research has failed to identify a molecule common to all the implicated metabolic pathways which could be a target for an effective preventive treatment against myopic progression.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698640","annotations":[{"name":"Nature versus nurture","weight":0.875478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.756561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.732755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.729716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.5799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Population genetics","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.514344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.513335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.4543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Environmental factor","weight":0.386404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_factor"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.305659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.167902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.113361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Reality","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
