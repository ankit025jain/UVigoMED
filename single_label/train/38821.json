{"id":38821,"title":"Familial adult-onset Pompe disease associated with unusual clinical and histological features.","abstract":"The adult-onset form of Pompe disease had a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic patients with increased CK to muscle cramps and pain syndrome or rigid-spine syndrome. In addition clinical severity and disease progression are greatly variable. We report on a family with 3 siblings characterized by an unusual adult-onset Pompe disease including dysphagia and weakness of tongue, axial and limb-girdle muscles, in association with atypical globular inclusions in muscle fibres. Our study confirms the great clinical and histological variability of adult-onset Pompe disease and further supports the need of careful evaluation of bulbar function in patients affected by this pathology.
