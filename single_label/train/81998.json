{"id":81998,"title":"Effectiveness of periodontal treatment on the improvement of inflammatory markers in children.","abstract":"It is known that atherosclerosis begins in childhood, a behaviour towards oral health care and metabolic control, since an early age, is essential for patients with cardiovascular disease. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of periodontal treatment full-mouth scaling and root planning (FMSRP), applied to children without systemic diseases, correlating with periodontal clinical and blood parameters (lipid profile and inflammatory markers).The 29 patients were divided into two groups, group 1 (14) - scaling and rot planning (SRP), group 2 (15) - FMSRP and the follow-up was conducted among 180 days.The results showed a significant improvement in clinical periodontal parameters (p<0.05) in both groups. In the analyzed blood parameters there was a greater evidence, with a significant improvement (p<0.05), in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), fibrinogen (FGN), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we suggest that both periodontal treatments were effective in children without any systemic diseases.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24747412","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.910201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.861668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.775437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.457294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.390907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.379204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.332822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Lipid profile","weight":0.191115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.175428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Decomposition","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"}]}
