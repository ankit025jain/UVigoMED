{"id":62872,"title":"Has-mir-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and risk of immune thrombocytopenia.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the has-mir-146a (miR-146a) genes with the risk for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The genotyping of miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. In the patients with ITP, the frequencies of GG, GC and CC genotypes and G and C alleles were 12.5%, 47.9%, 39.6%, 36.4% and 63.6%, respectively. There was no significant difference in genotype and alleles distribution between the ITP patient and the controls (p?=?0.77 and 0.51, respectively). No significant differences were found between the two groups when stratified by the age and disease course including acute adult, chronic adult, acute childhood and chronic childhood. In conclusion, there was no association between the SNP of miR-146a and the susceptibility to ITP in a Chinese population.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502829","annotations":[{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.801254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.72345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.696202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.518213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Guanine","weight":0.204746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.186121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"}]}
