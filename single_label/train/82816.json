{"id":82816,"title":"Prevalence and expression of human papillomavirus in 53 patients with oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been considered a potential risk factor for the development of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The purpose of the present study was to investigate HPV infection and high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression in SCC of the oral tongue in 53 Greek patients.Fifty-three biopsies were collected from patients with SCC of the oral tongue and tested for HPV DNA and E6/E7 mRNA expression.The overall prevalence of HPV DNA was 11.3% (6/53), while high-risk HPV DNA was found in 7.5% (4/53) of SCC of the oral tongue. E6/E7 mRNA expression was observed in 9.4% (5/53) samples examined. HPV 16 was the commonest genotype identified by both DNA and RNA assays. A total of 28.3% (15/53) of the patients were non-smokers and non-drinkers. HPV infection was strongly associated with abstinence from tobacco and alcohol (p=0.013).The presence of high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression suggests that HPV may be implicated in the pathogenesis of SCC of the oral tongue.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511049","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.795287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.671038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Greek language","weight":0.551199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.106802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
