{"id":5039,"title":"The problem total knee replacement: systematic, comprehensive and efficient evaluation.","abstract":"There are many reasons why a total knee replacement (TKR) may fail and qualify for revision. Successful revision surgery depends as much on accurate assessment of the problem TKR as it does on revision implant design and surgical technique. Specific modes of failure require specific surgical solutions. Causes of failure are often presented as a list or catalogue, without a system or process for making a decision. In addition, strict definitions and consensus on modes of failure are lacking in published series and registry data. How we approach the problem TKR is an essential but neglected aspect of understanding knee replacement surgery. It must be carried out systematically, comprehensively and efficiently. Eight modes of failure are described: 1) sepsis; 2) extensor discontinuity; 3) stiffness; 4) tibial- femoral instability; 5) patellar tracking; 6) aseptic loosening and osteolysis; 7) periprosthetic fracture and 8) component breakage. A ninth 'category', unexplained pain is an indication for further investigation but not surgery.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381420","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.643316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.482929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Osteolysis","weight":0.456903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteolysis"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.437219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.278259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.200392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.0753668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Grammatical aspect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect"},{"name":"Musical mode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_mode"},{"name":"Editing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editing"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Failure causes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_causes"},{"name":"Team Knight Rider","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Knight_Rider"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Telemetry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry"},{"name":"Consensus decision-making","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
