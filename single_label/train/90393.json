{"id":90393,"title":"Dexmedetomidine and propofol total intravenous anesthesia for airway foreign body removal.","abstract":"To detail our experience using dexmedetomidine in combination with propofol for airway foreign body removal in spontaneously breathing patients.Dexmedetomidine and propofol intravenous anesthesia as a primary anesthetic was used for three pediatric patients with severe respiratory impairment due to foreign body aspiration and two elderly patients requiring airway foreign body removal by rigid bronchoscopy. All patients were spontaneously ventilating, and had successful airway foreign body removal without severe hypoxemia. The three pediatric patients maintained stable respiratory and hemodynamic profiles. However, dexmedetomidine caused a significant change in the hemodynamics of the elderly patients.Dexmedetomidine and propofol intravenous anesthesia provided good anesthesia without causing respiratory depression. However, this technique related to more hemodynamic depression in elderly patients than in pediatrics.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619368","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoventilation","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoventilation"},{"name":"Propofol","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propofol"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.883517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.82209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Foreign body","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_body"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.688953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.548007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.31832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.231648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Dexmedetomidine","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexmedetomidine"},{"name":"Ventilation (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
