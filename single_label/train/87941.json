{"id":87941,"title":"2014 Neer Award Paper: neuromonitoring the Latarjet procedure.","abstract":"We used intraoperative neuromonitoring to define the stages of the Latarjet procedure during which the nerves are at greatest risk.Thirty-four patients with a mean age of 28.4 years were included. The Latarjet procedure was divided into 9 defined stages. Bilateral median and ulnar somatosensory evoked responses and transcranial motor evoked potentials from all arm myotomes were continuously monitored. A \"nerve alert\" was defined as averaged 50% amplitude attenuation or 10% latency prolongation of ipsilateral somatosensory evoked responses and transcranial motor evoked potentials. For each nerve alert, the surgeon altered retractor placement, and if there was no response to this, the position of the operative extremity was then changed.Of 34 patients, 26 (76.5%) had 45 separate nerve alert episodes. The most common stages of the procedure for a nerve alert to occur were glenoid exposure and graft insertion. The axillary nerve was involved in 35 alerts; the musculocutaneous nerve, in 22. Of the 34 patients, 7 (20.6%) had a clinically detectable nerve deficit postoperatively, all correlated with an intraoperative nerve alert. All cases involved the axillary nerve, and all resolved completely from 28 to 165 days postoperatively. Prior surgery and body mass index were not predictive of a neurologic deficit postoperatively. However, total operative time (P = .042) and duration of the stage of the procedure in which the concordant nerve alert occurred (P = .010) were statistically significant predictors of a postoperative nerve deficit.The nerves, in particular the axillary and musculocutaneous nerves, are at risk during the Latarjet procedure, especially during glenoid exposure and graft insertion.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24950948","annotations":[{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.821318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.554671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.38729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.307909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Evoked potential","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.238155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraoperative_neurophysiological_monitoring"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.108278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0451805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Axillary nerve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_nerve"},{"name":"Musculocutaneous nerve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculocutaneous_nerve"},{"name":"Myotome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotome"},{"name":"Glenoid cavity","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_cavity"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Concordant coastline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordant_coastline"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Retractor (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractor_(medical)"},{"name":"Transcranial doppler","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_doppler"},{"name":"Neer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neer"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Latency (engineering)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)"}]}
