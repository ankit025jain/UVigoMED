{"id":79330,"title":"An Australian survey of audiologists' preferences for patient-centredness.","abstract":"Patient-centredness is becoming a core value of health services worldwide, however it remains largely unexplored in audiology. This study investigated audiologists' preferences for patient-centredness and identified factors that explain audiologists' preferences for patient-centredness.All members of the Audiological Society of Australia received two questionnaires: (1) a descriptive questionnaire (e.g. age, gender, place of residence, years in practice, employment characteristics), and (2) a modified patient-practitioner orientation scale (PPOS; Krupat et al, 2000) which measures preferences for two aspects of patient-centredness, sharing and caring.In total 663 (46%) audiologists returned both questionnaires fully completed.Mean PPOS scores indicated that audiologists prefer patient-centredness. Linear regression modelling identified that older audiologists, that had practiced longer, and who worked in community education, industrial audiology, or teaching had a significantly greater preference for patient-centredness than their peers. In contrast, audiologists who practiced in a private environment and who worked in the area of assessment of adults had a significantly lesser preference for patient-centredness than their peers.Audiologists prefer client-centredness and age, years of experience, and employment characteristics can partly explain preferences for patient-centredness. Future research should explore the relationships between patient-centredness and intervention outcomes in audiology.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447231","annotations":[{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.891656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.737028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Value system","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_system"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.25303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.189465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.162983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"},{"name":"Sexual orientation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"663","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/663"},{"name":"Timeline of Solar System exploration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Solar_System_exploration"},{"name":"Level of measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Australians","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Adult education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_education"},{"name":"Private sector","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector"},{"name":"Peer group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_group"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
