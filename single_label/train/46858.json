{"id":46858,"title":"Investigation of sesamol on myeloperoxidase and colon morphology in acetic acid-induced inflammatory bowel disorder in albino rats.","abstract":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of gastrointestinal tract of immune, genetic, and environmental origin. In the present study, we examined the effects of sesamol (SES), which is the active constituent of sesame oil in the acetic acid (AA) induced model for IBD in rats.The groups were divided into normal control, AA control, SES, and sulfasalazine (SS). On day 7, the rats were killed, colon was removed, and the macroscopic, biochemical, and histopathological evaluations were performed.The levels of MPO, TBARS, and tissue nitrite increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the AA group whereas they reduced significantly in the SES and SS treated groups. Serum nitrite levels were found to be insignificant between the different groups.The mucosal protective effects of sesamol in IBD are due to its potential to reduce the myeloperoxidase and nitrite content.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616646","annotations":[{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Acetic acid","weight":0.86245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.8182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.805496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Sulfasalazine","weight":0.750836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfasalazine"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.707463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.6891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Albinism","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism"},{"name":"Nitrite","weight":0.648012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrite"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Sesame","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.124674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Active ingredient","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Sesame oil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_oil"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"Chronic inflammation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_inflammation"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"}]}
