{"id":61326,"title":"Intermittent pneumatic compression pump for breast cancer-related lymphedema: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","abstract":"Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common complication after the treatment of breast cancer. The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of an intermittent pneumatic pump (IPC) could manage lymphedema effectively.We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for related trials to compare the percent of volume reduction and subjective symptoms.7 randomized controlled trials, with 287 patients, were included. Results showed that the use of the IPC could alleviate lymphedema, but no significant difference between routine management of lymphedema with or without pneumatic pump existed.Current trials fail to show the effectiveness of the addition of an IPC to the routine management of BCRL.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732640","annotations":[{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.944133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.828515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.768094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.721221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.639797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.482581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.309501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.229368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.146903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Sequential compression device","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_compression_device"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Pump","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Intermittency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittency"},{"name":"Voxel-based morphometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry"},{"name":"Pneumatics","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
