{"id":89127,"title":"Surgical management of coracoid fractures: technical tricks and clinical experience.","abstract":"The coracoid process plays a pivotal role in the foundation of the coracoacromial arch and in cases of displaced fractures; surgical management may be warranted to avoid functional compromise or impingement. A direct approach through Langer's lines allows for easy exposure and direct visualization for an anatomic reduction of simple fractures through the shaft or base of the coracoid. An anterior approach for fractures that extend into the superior glenoid fossa allows for direct exposure to obtain an anatomic articular reduction and indirect reduction of the coracoid fracture. In cases where a complex glenoid or scapula neck/body fracture is being addressed simultaneously either a posterior Judet approach can be used with an indirect reduction method or a separate anterior approach must be combined to address it if not in continuity with the superior scapular segment. Implant selection, primarily interfragmentary screws or a buttress plate, should be based on the size of the fragment, the degree of comminution, and the degree of articular involvement to ensure adequate stabilization. The purpose of this manuscript was to describe a stepwise approach to the surgical management of displaced coracoid fractures, describe surgical tips and techniques, and to present the clinical outcomes in 22 patients after surgical treatment with this approach.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751608","annotations":[{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Scapula","weight":0.572819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapula"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.528298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Glenoid cavity","weight":0.371282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_cavity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.308922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.11872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Coracoid","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scapular","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapular"},{"name":"Buttress","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttress"},{"name":"Comminution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comminution"},{"name":"Coracoid process","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoid_process"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Continuity (fiction)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_(fiction)"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Arrow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow"},{"name":"Arch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch"},{"name":"Bachelor's degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Foundation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Robby Langers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_Langers"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Steps and skips","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_and_skips"}]}
