{"id":20843,"title":"An overview of breast emergencies and guide to management by interventional radiologists.","abstract":"A review of breast and emergencies may seem mutually exclusive of one another, but breast interventions beyond pathologic diagnosis are encountered and may be urgent. Acute breast situations that can potentially require interventional techniques to resolve include abscess or complications from percutaneous biopsy or trauma such as hemorrhage or pseudoaneurysm. Acute breast interventions are not commonly seen, but a working knowledge of the various treatment approaches and management is important. These entities can be similar to other areas of the body, but there are some specifics to the breast that can allow for optimal treatment and management.
