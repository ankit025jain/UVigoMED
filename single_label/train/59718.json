{"id":59718,"title":"[Comparison of low-dose thalidomide and prednisone combined with or without danazol for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis-associated anemia].","abstract":"To observe the clinical effects of low-dose thalidomide (THAL) and prednisone (PRED) with or without danazol (DANA) in patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) associated anemia.A cohort of 58 PMF patients with anemia (Hb<100 g/L) were retrospectively studied. Of them, 28 patients were treated with THAL and PRED (THAL-PRED group), and the rest with THAL, PRED and DANA (THAL-PRED-DANA group). The hematological response was assessed according to the modified criteria of the International Working Group in 2006, and the myelofibrosis degree was evaluated at 3 and 12 month after treatment.The total response rate was 56.9%(33/58) including 1.7% (1/58) partial remission (PR) and 55.2% (32/58) clinical improvement (CI). There was no statistical difference in the response rate between THAL-PRED and THAL-PREDDANA groups (50.0% vs 63.3%, P=0.306). However, the median response duration of clinical improvement, erythroid response (CI-E) and total response prolonged in THAL-PRED-DANA than THALPRED group (61.5w vs 22w, P=0.015; 75w vs 30w, P=0.007, respectively). Myelofibrosis degree at 3 and 12 months after treatment decreased significantly than before treatment (P=0.000 and 0.005, respectively). Side-effects in both groups were only grade 1-2.Low-dose THAL together with PRED appeared to be effective in the treatment of PMF-associated anemia, and the response duration would prolong significantly if combined with DANA.","date":"2014-08-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25152115","annotations":[{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.605647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.507117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.208635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Danazol","weight":0.190579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danazol"},{"name":"Thalidomide","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.120181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Myelofibrosis","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelofibrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0989837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Order of the Indian Empire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Indian_Empire"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"W","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W"},{"name":"306","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/306"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Motor oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_oil"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Twelfth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_grade"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"152mm SpGH DANA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/152mm_SpGH_DANA"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Working (musical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(musical)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
