{"id":44945,"title":"Assessing bolus retention in achalasia using high-resolution manometry with impedance: a comparator study with timed barium esophagram.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess whether high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) could be used to assess bolus retention similar to the timed barium esophagram (TBE).Twenty achalasia patients (10 males, aged 21-79 years) were prospectively evaluated with HRIM and TBE to determine the correlation between barium column height and the impedance bolus height (IBH). The TBE protocol used a 200-ml barium challenge and the HRIM protocol used a 200-ml saline challenge protocol. Both protocols were performed in an upright position and the heights of the barium and impedance columns were measured at 1 and 5 min. Analysis of IBH was performed with a topographic technique and a spatial impedance variation plot.There was no significant difference between the median IBH and barium column at 1 min (IBH: 12.0 cm (interquartile range (IQR), 8.0-18.0); TBE: 12.0 cm (IQR, 7.0-19.0); P=0.90) or at 5 min (IBH: 11.0 cm (IQR, 1.0-17.0); TBE: 9.0 cm (IQR, 4.0-12.0); P=0.47). In addition, the correlation between the two measurements at 1 and 5 min was 0.60 and 0.86, respectively. Using a barium column or impedance height of >5.0 as a definition of bolus retention was associated with 75% concordance at 1 min and 95% concordance at 5 min.There was excellent agreement between TBE and high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) for assessing bolus retention at 5 min. Thus, HRM with impedance may be used as a single test to assess bolus retention and motor function in the management of achalasia.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710506","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.239972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Achalasia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achalasia"},{"name":"Barium swallow","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_swallow"},{"name":"Manometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manometry"},{"name":"Bolus (digestion)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_(digestion)"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Barium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Plot (narrative)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)"},{"name":"Electric motor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"2170s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2170s"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Salinity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity"},{"name":"Comparator","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparator"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"TBE buffer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBE_buffer"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
