{"id":60815,"title":"The role of inflammation in lymphoma.","abstract":"Human lymphomas usually develop in specialized tissue microenvironments characterized by different populations of accessory stromal and lymphoid cells that interact with malignant cells. A clinical role of the tumor microenvironment has recently emerged, bringing new knowledge and suggesting new ideas and targets for treatment. This chapter analyzes the microenvironment in human lymphomas highlighting the role of inflammation in their pathogenesis. Microenvironmental specificity is detailed according to different models including classic Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL).
