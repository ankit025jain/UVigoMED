{"id":55663,"title":"A single-arm, investigator-initiated study of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravitreal aflibercept injection in subjects with exudative age-related macular degeneration, previously treated with ranibizumab or bevacizumab: 6-month interim anal","abstract":"To evaluate efficacy and safety of intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) in subjects who were previously treated with ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab for active exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Patients (n=26) were enrolled in a 12-month prospective, interventional, single arm, investigator-initiated study with planned 6-month interim analysis. Patients with active exudative AMD, previously treated with ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab, were treated with 2?mg IAI every month for the first 3?months, followed by a fixed dosing schedule of 2?mg IAI every 2?months. The primary study endpoint was the mean absolute change from baseline central subfield thickness (CST) at month 12 as measured by SDOCT. Secondary outcomes included mean change from baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score, percentage of subjects who gained or lost greater than or equal to 15 letters of vision, percentage of subjects who are 20/40 or better, percentage of subjects who are 20/200 or worse, and the incidence of adverse events (AE) and serious AEs.Planned 6-month interim analysis demonstrated a mean decrease in CST of 38.6?Âµm (p<0.001) and a mean increase in ETDRS BCVA of +5.9 letters (p<0.001). Fifteen percent of subjects experienced a greater than 15-letter improvement in visual acuity, 84.6% of patients gained visual acuity, and no patient lost 3 lines of vision from baseline. Forty-two percent of subjects were 20/40 or better, and 11.5% of subjects were 20/200 or worse at month 6. No serious ocular or systemic AEs were encountered.IAI-treated eyes demonstrated improved short-term functional and anatomic endpoints in subjects with active exudative AMD switching from previous anti-VEGF treatment when given in a fixed dosing scheme for 6?months.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Eye
