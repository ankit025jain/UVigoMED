{"id":72459,"title":"Preclinical evaluation of a high-affinity 18F-trifluoroborate octreotate derivative for somatostatin receptor imaging.","abstract":"Recent studies have highlighted the high sensitivity of PET imaging with (68)Ga-labeled octreotide derivatives for the detection and staging of neuroendocrine tumors. A somatostatin receptor ligand that is easily radiolabeled with (18)F-fluoride could improve the availability of PET imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. We report an alkyltrifluoroborate-octreotate conjugate that is radiolabeled in a 1-step (18)F exchange reaction in high yield and with high specific activity.We conjugated a new alkyltrifluoroborate to octreotate to obtain AMBF3-TATE, which was stored in 50-nmol aliquots for radiolabeling. (18)F labeling was performed by (18)F-(19)F isotope exchange with (18)F-fluoride, and the tracer was purified by C18 cartridge separation. The radiochemical yield was 20%-25%. PET imaging and biodistribution were performed on mice bearing AR42J tumor xenografts.AMBF3-TATE bound the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 with high affinity (inhibition constant, 0.13 ± 0.03 nM). Starting with 29.6-37 GBq (0.8-1 Ci) of (18)F-fluoride, more than 7.4 GBq (>200 mCi) of (18)F-AMBF3-TATE were obtained in 25 min (n = 5) with greater than 99% radiochemical purity at high specific activity (>111 GBq [3 Ci]/?mol). (18)F-AMBF3-TATE was stable in plasma. PET imaging and biodistribution showed rapid renal excretion with low liver activity. High tumor uptake (10.11% ± 1.67% injected dose/g, n = 5) was detected at 60 min after injection. Bone uptake was negligible. Tumor-to-liver, tumor-to-blood, tumor-to-muscle, and tumor-to-bone ratios (at 60 min) were 26.2 ± 0.8, 25.1 ± 1.0, 89.0 ± 3.1, and 21.3 ± 3.6, respectively.(18)F-AMBF3-TATE was radiolabeled in high yield and at high specific activity, did not require high-performance liquid chromatography purification, exhibited unexpectedly high binding affinity to somatostatin receptor subtype 2, and showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties in vivo, with high tumor uptake and high contrast ratios.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970911","annotations":[{"name":"Mole
