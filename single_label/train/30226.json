{"id":30226,"title":"Substance misuse teaching in undergraduate medical education.","abstract":"Over 12,000 hospital admissions in the UK result from substance misuse, therefore issues surrounding this need to be addressed early on in a doctor's training to facilitate their interaction with this client group. Currently, undergraduate medical education includes teaching substance misuse issues, yet how this is formally integrated into the curriculum remains unclear.Semi-structured interviews with 17 key members of staff responsible for the whole or part of the undergraduate medical curriculum were conducted to identify the methods used to teach substance misuse. Using a previously devised toolkit, 19 curriculum co-ordinators then mapped the actual teaching sessions that addressed substance misuse learning objectives.Substance misuse teaching was delivered primarily in psychiatry modules but learning objectives were also found in other areas such as primary care placements and problem-based learning. On average, 53 teaching sessions per medical school focused on bio-psycho-social models of addiction whereas only 23 sessions per medical school focused on professionalism, fitness to practice and students' own health in relation to substance misuse. Many sessions addressed specific learning objectives relating to the clinical features of substance dependence whereas few focused on iatrogenic addiction.Substance misuse teaching is now inter-disciplinary and the frequent focus on clinical, psychological and social effects of substance misuse emphasises the bio-psycho-social approach underlying clinical practice. Some areas however are not frequently taught in the formal curriculum and these need to be addressed in future changes to medical education.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24533849","annotations":[{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.821006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.791621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Undergraduate education","weight":0.698602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education"},{"name":"Medical school","weight":0.675211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.673986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Medical education","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_education"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Curriculum","weight":0.631559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.558821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"School","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.486382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Learning","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.468758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.440988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.358641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.290737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Biopsychosocial model","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model"},{"name":"Industrial Revolution","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Cartography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Consumer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"},{"name":"Racial integration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_integration"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
