{"id":38440,"title":"Bigger is better and worse: on the intricate relationship between hippocampal size and memory.","abstract":"The structure-function relationship between the hippocampal region and memory is a debated topic in the literature. It has been suggested that larger hippocampi are associated with less effective memory performance in healthy young adults because of a partial synaptic pruning. Here, we tested this hypothesis in individuals with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) with known abnormal pruning and IQ- and age-matched individuals with hypoxic brain injury, preterm birth, and obstetric complications. Results revealed larger normalized hippocampal volume in FXS compared with neurotypical controls, whereas individuals with hypoxic injury had smaller hippocampi. In neurotypical controls and individuals with hypoxic injury, better general memory, as indexed by the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, was associated with larger hippocampus. In contrast, in FXS we observed the opposite relationship: larger hippocampus was associated with worse general memory. Caudate volume did not correlate with memory in either group. These results suggest that incomplete pruning in young healthy adults may not contribute to less efficient memory capacity, and hippocampal size is positively associated with memory performance. However, abnormally large and poorly pruned hippocampus may indeed be less effective in FXS.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423661","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Fragile X syndrome","weight":0.819225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.805588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.717127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Intelligence quotient","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.576106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Synaptic pruning","weight":0.530486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_pruning"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.520579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Caudate nucleus","weight":0.421785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudate_nucleus"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.325721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.061187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0398575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Foreign exchange station","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_station"},{"name":"Cerebral hypoxia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hypoxia"},{"name":"Neurotypical","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Computer memory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Pruning","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning"},{"name":"Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale"},{"name":"Topic (linguistics)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
