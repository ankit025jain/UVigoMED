{"id":14767,"title":"Evaluation of (131)I-pentamidine for scintigraphy of experimentally Leishmania tropica-infected hamsters.","abstract":"We aimed to assess the ability of (131)I-Pentamidine scintigraphy to detect the lesions of Leishmania tropica infection. An experimental model of cutaneous leishmaniasis was developed. The presence of cutaneous leishmaniasis was confirmed. Pentamidine was radioiodinated with (131)I. The radiolabeled pentamidine was validated by the requisite quality control tests to check its radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro stability. (131)I-Pentamidine (activity: 18.5?MBq/100?Âµl) was injected intracardiacally into infected hamsters. Static whole body images of the hamsters were acquired under the gamma camera at 5 and 30?min, 2, 6 and 24?h following the administration. On the scintigrams, anatomically adjusted regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over the right feet (target) and left feet (not-target) and various organs. Accumulation of (131)I-Pentamidine at sites of infection is expressed as the target to non-target (T/NT) ratio. The results T/NT ratio decreased with time. In concluding the (131)I-Pentamidine has poor sensitivity in detection of L. tropica infection.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24405123","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.54844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Gamma camera","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_camera"},{"name":"Becquerel","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becquerel"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Leishmaniasis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Trinitrotoluene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitrotoluene"},{"name":"Pentamidine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentamidine"},{"name":"Cutaneous leishmaniasis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_leishmaniasis"},{"name":"Leishmania tropica","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania_tropica"},{"name":"Leishmania","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leishmania"},{"name":"Scintigraphy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintigraphy"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Hamster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Camera","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Static (DC Comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Region of interest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_of_interest"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Quality control","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control"}]}
