{"id":4486,"title":"Improving the performance of interorganizational networks for preventing chronic disease: identifying and acting on research needs.","abstract":"This article describes the role of interorganizational networks in chronic disease prevention and an action research agenda for promoting understanding and improvement. Through a model of engaged scholarship, leaders with expertise and experience in chronic disease prevention networks helped shape research directions focused on network value, governance, and evolution. The guiding principles for facilitating this research include applying existing knowledge, developing network-appropriate methods and measures, creating structural change, promoting an impact orientation, and fostering cultural change.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518146","annotations":[{"name":"Culture","weight":0.784333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.606228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.357054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.325669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Acting","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Governance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance"},{"name":"Scholarship","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship"},{"name":"Sexual orientation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Structural change","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_change"},{"name":"Action theory (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_theory_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Action research","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_research"}]}
