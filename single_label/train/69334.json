{"id":69334,"title":"Epigenetic silencing of Na,K-ATPase ? 1 subunit gene ATP1B1 by methylation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"The Na,K-ATPase or sodium pump carries out the coupled extrusion of Na(+) and uptake of K(+) across the plasma membranes of cells of most higher eukaryotes. We have shown earlier that Na,K-ATPase-? 1 (NaK-?) protein levels are highly reduced in poorly differentiated kidney carcinoma cells in culture and in patients' tumor samples. The mechanism(s) regulating the expression of NaK-? in tumor tissues has yet to be explored. We hypothesized that DNA methylation plays a role in silencing the NaK-? gene (ATP1B1) expression in kidney cancers. In this study, to the best of our knowledge we provide the first evidence that ATP1B1 is epigenetically silenced by promoter methylation in both renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients' tissues and cell lines. We also show that knockdown of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene in RCC cell lines results in enhanced ATP1B1 promoter AT hypermethylation, which is accompanied by reduced expression of NaK-?. Furthermore, treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine rescued the expression of ATP1B1 mRNA as well as NaK-? protein in these cells. These data demonstrate that promoter hypermethylation is associated with reduced NaK-? expression, which might contribute to RCC initiation and/or disease progression.
