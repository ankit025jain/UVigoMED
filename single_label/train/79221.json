{"id":79221,"title":"Platelet glycoproteins and fibrinogen in recovery from idiopathic sudden hearing loss.","abstract":"The pathomechanism and location of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is unclear. In a previous case-control study, we found elevated fibrinogen concentrations and a higher prevalence of T allele carriers of the glycoprotein (Gp) Ia C807T polymorphism in ISSHL patients.127 patients with ISSHL (mean age 53.3 years, 48.8% females), who underwent a standard therapy with high dose steroids, pentoxifyllin and sterofundine over 8 days were included. We examined the influence of GpIa genotype and fibrinogen (BclI-, A312-, HaeIII-) genotype and fibrinogen plasma levels on hearing recovery after 8 weeks (change from baseline: 0 dB ?=? no recovery, >0 to 10 dB?=?moderate recovery, >10 dB?=?good recovery). In a subsample of 59 patients with ISSHL, we further studied the association of platelet glycoprotein GpIa, Ib and IIIa densities on hearing recovery as well as the possible effect-modification of platelet glycoproteins on hearing recovery by plasma fibrinogen.In univariate analysis, neither the GpIa genotype nor fibrinogen genotype (all p>0.1) but lower fibrinogen levels (p?=?0.029), less vertigo (p?=?0.002) and lower GpIIIa receptor density (p?=?0.037, n?=?59) were associated with hearing recovery. In multivariate analysis, fibrinogen significantly modified the effect of GPIa receptor density on good hearing recovery (effect-modification on multiplicative scale OR?=?0.45 (95% confidence interval (0.21-0.94)), p?=?0.03). GPIb receptor density below the mean was associated with a 2-fold increase in good hearing recovery both in patients with fibrinogen levels above (p?=?0.04) as well as in patients with fibrinogen levels below the mean (p?=?0.06). There was no indication for an effect-modification (p?=?0.97).The findings suggest a vascular/rheological origin of ISSHL with unique features of thrombosis in the inner ear artery that may include complex interrelationships among platelet glycoproteins and plasma fibrinogen.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466284","annotations":[{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.859089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.837917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.773478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.741545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.684368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.636917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.589614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.558405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Inner ear","weight":0.365993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_ear"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.351083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.265579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.219339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.141043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Univariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate_analysis"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Multiplicative function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_function"},{"name":"807","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/807"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Glycoprotein Ib","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein_Ib"},{"name":"Ia (genus)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ia_(genus)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_roads_in_Zone_3_of_the_Great_Britain_numbering_scheme"}]}
