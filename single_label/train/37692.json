{"id":37692,"title":"Simultaneous stenting of tightly stenosed patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery bifurcation using two stents (Y stenting): an innovative technique.","abstract":"Stenting of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a palliative technique that is evolving as an alternative to shunt surgery. Patients with duct-dependant pulmonary circulation and branch pulmonary artery stenosis are often palliated by shunt surgery with repair of branch pulmonary arteries under cardiopulmonary bypass. We present here an 8-month-old male child with duct-dependant pulmonary circulation with bifurcation stenosis who was palliated successfully by transcatheter means. He had stenosed PDA with tight pulmonary artery bifurcation stenosis and underwent successful \"Y\" stenting of PDA with simultaneous deployment of two stents. He successfully underwent bidirectional Glenn surgery 8 months after the procedure. Simultaneous stenting of bifurcation stenosis of branch pulmonary arteries with two stents has not been described in the literature.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478204","annotations":[{"name":"Patent ductus arteriosus","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Pulmonary circulation","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_circulation"},{"name":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_bypass"},{"name":"Pulmonary artery","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery"},{"name":"Ductus arteriosus","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.642546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.44434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Personal digital assistant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"},{"name":"Cardiac shunt","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_shunt"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Reference counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting"},{"name":"Duct (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Undescribed taxon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undescribed_taxon"}]}
