{"id":70219,"title":"[End of the commercialisation of (192)Ir wires in France: proposals of the groupe de Curieth√©rapie de la SFRO].","abstract":"In 2014, the production of iridium 192 wires in France ended. Thus brachytherapy departments had to move to high-dose rate and pulsed-dose rate afterloading techniques. Most of them had already made this migration for some indications, based on the habits and investments. The brachytherapy group organised meetings and opened discussions to share the clinical knowledge and answer to the questions raised by this migration. This made it possible to resolve and describe quite all the clinical and technical cases of brachytherapy. The development of high technology included the use of 3D dosimetry and optimisation of dose distribution and fractionation. The teaching policy of new technologies contributes to the improvement of treatment quality. Last but not least, a better reimbursement of brachytherapy is necessary and currently negotiated.
