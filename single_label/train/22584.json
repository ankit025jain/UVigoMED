{"id":22584,"title":"Facility design and healthcare-acquired infections: state of the science.","abstract":"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a serious threat to patients and healthcare providers. Although human factors are commonly studied in an attempt to reduce HAIs, less is known about the effect of specific facility design features on mitigating the transmission of pathogens from human to human. This facility design department aims to expand nurse leaders' knowledge and competencies in health facility design. This article discusses the state of the science in the relationship of facility design on reducing HAIs.
