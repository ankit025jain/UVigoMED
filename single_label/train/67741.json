{"id":67741,"title":"Weaker masturbatory erection may be a sign of early cardiovascular risk associated with erectile dysfunction in young men without sexual intercourse.","abstract":"Although increasing evidences emphasize the importance of early cardiovascular evaluation in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) of unexplained aetiology, impaired masturbation-induced erections in young men are usually overlooked and habitually presumed to be psychological origin.To evaluate the young men presenting weaker masturbatory erection with no sexual intercourse (WME-NS) and verify if this cohort have early cardiovascular risks associated with ED.Male subjects aged 18-40 years with WME-NS were screened by analyzing detailed sexual intercourse and masturbatory history. The age-matched ED and non-ED population were identified by using International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). All subjects with acute and/or chronic diseases (including diagnosed hypertension and diabetes) and long-term pharmacotherapy were excluded. Nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR), systemic vascular parameters and biochemical indicators related to metabolism were assessed.Comparison analysis and logistic regression analysis were conducted among WME-NS, ED and non-ED population.In total, 78 WME-NS cases (mean 28.99?±?5.92 years), 179 ED cases (mean 30.69?±?5.21 years) and 43 non-ED cases (mean 28.65?±?4.30 years) were screened for analysis. Compared with non-ED group, WME-NS group had higher prevalence of early ED risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, high level of glycosylated serum protein and abnormal NPTR. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis showed endothelia dysfunction (odds ratio: 8.83 vs. 17.11, both P?<?0.001) was the independent risk factor for both WME-NS and ED.Weaker masturbatory erection may be a sign of early cardiovascular risk associated with ED in young men without sexual intercourse. More studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical benefits by targeting these formulated strategies.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital
