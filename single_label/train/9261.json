{"id":9261,"title":"Interferon regulatory factor 1 restricts gammaherpesvirus replication in primary immune cells.","abstract":"Gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that establish a lifelong infection and are associated with cancer. In spite of the high seroprevalence of infection, the risk factors that predispose the host toward gammaherpesvirus-induced malignancies are still poorly understood. Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a tumor suppressor that is also involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. On the basis of its biology, IRF-1 represents a plausible host factor to attenuate gammaherpesvirus infection and tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that IRF-1 restricts gammaherpesvirus replication in primary macrophages, a physiologically relevant immune cell type. In spite of the known role of IRF-1 in stimulating type I IFN expression, induction of a global type I IFN response was similar in IRF-1-deficient and -proficient macrophages during gammaherpesvirus infection. However, IRF-1 was required for optimal expression of cholesterol-25-hydroxylase, a host enzyme that restricted gammaherpesvirus replication in primary macrophages and contributed to the antiviral effects of IRF-1. In summary, the current study provides an insight into the mechanism by which IRF-1 attenuates gammaherpesvirus replication in primary immune cells, a mechanism that is likely to contribute to the antiviral effects of IRF-1 in other virus systems.Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates innate and adaptive immune responses and functions as a tumor suppressor. IRF-1 restricts the replication of diverse viruses; however, the mechanisms responsible for the antiviral effects of IRF-1 are still poorly understood. Gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that are associated with the induction of several malignancies. Here we show that IRF-1 expression attenuates gammaherpesvirus replication in primary macrophages, in part by increasing expression of cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H). CH25H and its product, 25-hydroxycholesterol, restrict replication of diverse virus families. Thus, our findings offer an insight into the mechanism by which IRF-1 attenuates the replication of gammaherpesviruses, a mechanism that is likely to be applicable to other virus systems.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719409","annotations":[{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Gammaherpesvirinae","weight":0.734955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gammaherpesvirinae"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.666691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.605506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.540631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Adaptive behavior","weight":0.327397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_behavior"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Hydroxylation","weight":0.19899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.177919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Seroprevalence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
