{"id":11348,"title":"Detection and isolation of infectious laryngotracheitis virus on a broiler farm after a disease outbreak.","abstract":"A broiler farm in North Alabama suffered a mild infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) outbreak, as determined by clinical disease and PCR. The poultry integrator sought help to control further outbreaks in subsequent flocks. Samples were collected from various areas of the poultry houses on the farm over an 8-wk period. The first sampling was conducted 8 days after the infected farm was depopulated; the second was conducted 2 days prior to subsequent flock placement; and the third was conducted when the new flock was 5 wk of age. Samples were examined for ILT virus (ILTV) DNA by real-time PCR and virus isolation in embryos. The infected houses were cleaned, disinfected, heated, litter composted, and curtains replaced after the first sampling and prior to placement of the next flock. Samples from all periods were positive for ILTV DNA. However, the number of positive samples and crossing point values indicated a decrease in the amount of viral DNA, while virus isolation in embryos was successful only on the first sampling. The subsequent flock was vaccinated against ILTV by in ovo route using a commercial recombinant vaccine. Cleaning and sanitation after the disease outbreak reduced the amount of ILTV on the farm and together with in ovo vaccination of the new flock may have prevented a recurrence of another ILT outbreak.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597126","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.785439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.758056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.644453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.611855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Compost","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.351349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Alabama","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.160377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Wicket-keeper","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper"},{"name":"Broiler","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Population decline","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0194402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"History of Taiwan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Taiwan"},{"name":"Clovis culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture"},{"name":"Integrator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrator"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Gallid herpesvirus 1","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallid_herpesvirus_1"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Curtain","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtain"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Litter (animal)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(animal)"},{"name":"ILT","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILT"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"North Alabama","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Alabama"}]}
