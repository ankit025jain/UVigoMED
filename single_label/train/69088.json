{"id":69088,"title":"Spot urine protein measurements in kidney transplantation: a systematic review of diagnostic accuracy.","abstract":"Quantification of proteinuria (albuminuria) in renal transplant recipients is important for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Recent guidelines have recommended quantification of proteinuria by spot protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) or spot albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Validity of spot measurements remains unclear in renal transplant recipients.Systematic review of adult kidney transplant recipients. Studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of PCR or ACR as compared with 24-h urine protein or albumin excretion in renal transplant recipients were included.The search identified 8 studies involving 1871 renal transplant recipients. The correlation of the PCR to 24-h protein ranged from 0.772 to 0.998 with a median value of 0.92. PCR sensitivity ranged from 63 to 99 (50% of sensitivities were >90%); PCR specificity varied from 73 to 99 (50% of specificities were >90%). Only one study reported the bias; percent bias ranged from 12 to 21% and accuracy (within 30% of 24 h urine protein) ranged from 47 to 56% depending on the degree of proteinuria. For the ACR, percent bias ranged from 9 to 21%, and the accuracy (within 30%) ranged from 38 to 80%.The data regarding diagnostic accuracy of PCR and ACR is limited. Only one report studied the absolute measures of agreement (bias and accuracy). We recommend verifying PCR and ACR measurements with a 24-h protein before making any major diagnostic (e.g. biopsy) or therapeutic (e.g. change in immunosuppressive agents) decisions in this population.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24470518","annotations":[{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.823548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.734837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.371018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0933055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0369874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"American College of Rheumatology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Rheumatology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
