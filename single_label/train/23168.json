{"id":23168,"title":"Bloodstream infections caused by Pseudomonas spp.: how to detect carbapenemase producers directly from blood cultures.","abstract":"The Carba NP test has been evaluated to detect carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas spp. directly from blood cultures. This rapid and cost-effective test permits an early identification of carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas spp. directly from blood cultures with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Results may be useful in particular for guiding the first-line therapy and epidemiological purposes.
