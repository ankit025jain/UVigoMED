{"id":84356,"title":"A high-protein formula increases colonic peptide transporter 1 activity during neonatal life in low-birth-weight piglets and disturbs barrier function later in life.","abstract":"Dietary peptides are absorbed along the intestine through peptide transporter 1 (PepT-1) which is highly responsive to dietary protein level. PepT-1 is also involved in gut homeostasis, both initiating and resolving inflammation. Low-birth-weight (LBW) neonates are routinely fed a high-protein (HP) formula to enhance growth. However, the influence of this nutritional practice on PepT-1 activity is unknown. Intestinal PepT-1 activity was compared in normal-birth-weight (NBW) and LBW piglets. The effect of HP v. normal-protein (NP) formula feeding on PepT-1 activity and gut homeostasis in LBW piglets was evaluated, during the neonatal period and in adulthood. Flux of cephalexin (CFX) across the tissue mounted in Ussing chambers was used as an indicator of PepT-1 activity. CFX flux was greater in the ileum, but not jejunum or colon, of LBW than NBW piglets during the neonatal period. When LBW piglets were formula-fed, the HP formula increased colonic CFX during the 1st week of life. Later in life, intestinal CFX fluxes and barrier function were similar whether LBW pigs had been fed NP or HP formula. However, colonic permeability of HP- but not NP-fed pigs increased when luminal pH was brought to 6Â·0. The formyl peptide N-formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine conferred colonic barrier protection in HP-fed piglets. Heat shock protein 27 levels in the colonic mucosa of HP-fed LBW pigs correlated with the magnitude of response to the acidic challenge. In conclusion, feeding a HP formula enhanced colonic PepT-1 activity in LBW pig neonates and increased sensitivity of the colon to luminal stress in adulthood.
