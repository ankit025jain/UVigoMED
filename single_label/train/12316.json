{"id":12316,"title":"Evaluation of liver fibrosis and hepatic venous pressure gradient with MR elastography in a novel swine model of cirrhosis.","abstract":"To assess the correlation among MR elastography (MRE) measured liver stiffness (LS), liver fibrosis, and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in a swine model of cirrhosis.Three swine served as controls, and liver fibrosis was induced in eight swine by transarterial embolization. LS and HVPG were obtained at baseline and 4 weeks (prenecropsy) following induction of liver fibrosis.Four weeks following the induction of liver cirrhosis, experimental animals developed an increase in HVPG of 8.0±6.4 mmHg compared with 0.3±1.2 mmHg for controls (P=0.08). Over the same timeframe, mean MRE-measured LS increased 0.82±0.39 kPa for experimental swine and 0.1±0.05 kPa for controls (P=0.01). A positive correlation was observed between increases in HVPG and LS (?=0.682; P=0.02). Liver fibrosis was measured on explanted livers at 4 weeks and yielded mean fibrosis scores of 2.8 for experimental animals and 0 for controls (P=0.0016). A positive correlation was observed between higher LS and liver fibrosis (?=0.884; P=0.0003).MRE is a reliable noninvasive technique to measure LS in a swine model of cirrhosis. Significant positive correlations were observed between LS and HVPG as well as LS and fibrosis.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532376","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.775558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.719272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.408367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Pascal (unit)","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.342722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.328987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.187304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0387277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Meal, Ready-to-Eat","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat"},{"name":"Elastography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"820","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/820"},{"name":"682","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/682"},{"name":"884","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/884"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Timeline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Gradient","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Pressure gradient","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_gradient"}]}
