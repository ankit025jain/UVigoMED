{"id":77388,"title":"[Professional risk assessment for modern pesticides during their application in the horticulture].","abstract":"The work conditions on application of modern pesticides Masai, Regalis and Bellis for apple orchards protection have been researched. We show that total risk of hazard influence of tebufenpyrad, prohexadione-calcium, pyraclostrobin and boscalid on agricultural workers under condition of complex entry in body through skin and respiratory tracts is permissible. We proved that application of studied preparations is not dangerous for workers in case of abidance of agrotechnical and hygienic regulations.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908975","annotations":[{"name":"Risk","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.593459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Pesticide","weight":0.461693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.411873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.389893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.363374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.333672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.199109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.0627764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Apple","weight":0.0546422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple"},{"name":"Orchard","weight":0.0459474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard"},{"name":"Respiratory tract","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Bellis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellis"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Tract (literature)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tract_(literature)"}]}
