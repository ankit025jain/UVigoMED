{"id":37540,"title":"The role of fetal echocardiography in the assessment of fetal aneuploidy.","abstract":"Advances in both imaging technology and understanding of fetal cardiac disease have contributed to a dramatic increase in the sensitivity and specificity of fetal echocardiography over the last few decades. Fetal echocardiography now plays an important role in the prenatal evaluation of fetuses with known or suspected aneuploidy. In this article, specific situations in which fetal echocardiography has a part in noninvasive aneuploidy screening algorithms are discussed.
