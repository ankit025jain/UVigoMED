{"id":45273,"title":"The interaction of a single-nucleotide polymorphism with age on response to interferon-? and ribavirin therapy in female patients with hepatitis C infection.","abstract":"Older female patients exhibit a poor response to the current standard treatment for hepatitis C, interferon-?, and ribavirin (PEG-IFN-?/RBV). In this study, we reported that the combination of age and the genotype of a novel SNP can predict response to standard treatment (P?=?7.31?Ã—?10(-8)). The model incorporating genotype of the novel SNP, rs1287948, predicts response more accurately (AUC?=?0.934; 95% CI?=?0.881-0.988) in women as compared with the model using age and the previously identified SNP, rs8099917.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692042","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.751478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.664199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.583969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.496553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.467061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.436612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.374824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ribavirin","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.0722665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Self-Defense_Forces_of_Colombia"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"988","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/988"},{"name":"934","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/934"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Heckler & Koch P7","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_&_Koch_P7"}]}
