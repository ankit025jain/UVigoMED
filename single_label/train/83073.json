{"id":83073,"title":"Angled dental implant placement into the vomer/nasal crest of atrophic maxillae for All-on-Four immediate function: a 2-year clinical study of 100 consecutive patients.","abstract":"To report on the use of angled implants placed into the vomer/nasal crest to support a complete-arch maxillary prosthesis.Consecutive patients were treated with the All-on-Four concept to restore the maxillary dentition. When bone volume in the subnasal region was inadequate, angled implants were placed into the vomer/nasal crest area to support the restoration. All implants were loaded immediately.One hundred consecutive maxillary All-on-Four patients were treated over a period of 2 years. Four hundred six implants were placed; 12 were inserted into the vomer/nasal crest area. One year later, at definitive restoration, the 12 vomer implants were found to be osseointegrated without bone loss or instability.Midline maxillary bone volume at the nasal crest appeared to be a viable alternative to the lateral nasal rim when subnasal bone was deficient. Vomer implants allowed for immediate function or were sometimes used as a rescue implant when an anterior implant failed.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451885","annotations":[{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.724904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.694554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.694102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.668966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Dentition","weight":0.395717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.38582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Vomer","weight":0.382443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomer"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.212892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Osseointegration","weight":0.201849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osseointegration"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Nasal bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Rescue","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue"},{"name":"Crest (heraldry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(heraldry)"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"}]}
