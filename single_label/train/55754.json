{"id":55754,"title":"Increased incidence and disparity of diagnosis of retinoblastoma patients in Guatemala.","abstract":"Analysis of 327 consecutive cases at a pediatric referral hospital of Guatemala reveals that retinoblastoma accounts for 9.4% of all cancers and the estimated incidence is 7.0 cases/million children, higher than the United States or Europe. The number of familial cases is low, and there is a striking disparity in indigenous children due to late diagnosis, advanced disease, rapid progression and elevated mortality. Nine germline mutations in 18 patients were found; two known and five new mutations. Hypermethylation of RB1 was identified in 13% of the tumors. An early diagnosis program could identify cases at an earlier age and improve outcome of retinoblastoma in this diverse population.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814393","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.742176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Guatemala","weight":0.557443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.381224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.3769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.239959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Retinoblastoma","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Strike action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Running back","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"},{"name":"Rapid transit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Retinoblastoma protein","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma_protein"}]}
