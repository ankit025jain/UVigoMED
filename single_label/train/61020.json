{"id":61020,"title":"Mifepristone causing complete remission of rapidly advancing leukemia with measurement of progesterone-induced blocking factor.","abstract":"Mifepristone has been demonstrated to cause palliation from murine and human cancer, even in cancers not known to be positive for expression of progesterone receptors. The aim of the present study was to determine if rapidly advancing chronic lymphocytic leukemia responds to mifepristone therapy, and if so, is this effect related to increased expression of the progesterone-induced blocking factor?An 81-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia whose condition progressed to the acute rapidly progressing stage agreed to be exclusively treated orally with 200 mg mifepristone daily.The patient showed a dramatic improvement after a short exposure time to mifepristone. Complete remission has persisted so far for 12 months on exclusive mifepristone therapy. Her PIBF levels were normal before mifepristone therapy and did not change after treatment.Mifepristone can provide marked improvement of human leukemia even in the absence of increased serum PIBF levels.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778052","annotations":[{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.847851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.836676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.782798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.720177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.711061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.549595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.510689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Mifepristone","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.322903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.314732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.0950163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"}]}
