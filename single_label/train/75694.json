{"id":75694,"title":"Endoscopic third ventriculostomy has no higher costs than ventriculoperitoneal shunt.","abstract":"To evaluate the cost of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) compared to ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) in the treatment of hydrocephalus in children.We studied 103 children with hydrocephalus, 52 of which were treated with ETV and 51 with VPS in a prospective cohort. Treatment costs were compared within the first year after surgery, including subsequent surgery or hospitalization.Twenty (38.4%) of the 52 children treated with VPS needed another procedure due to shunt failure, compared to 11 (21.5%) of 51 children in the ETV group. The average costs per patient in the group treated with ETV was USD$ 2,177,66±517.73 compared to USD$ 2,890.68±2,835.02 for the VPS group.In this series there was no significant difference in costs between the ETV and VPS groups.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25054985","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.530369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.475048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Hydrocephalus","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ventriculostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventriculostomy"},{"name":"835","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/835"},{"name":"682","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/682"},{"name":"890","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/890"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Vaasan Palloseura","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaasan_Palloseura"},{"name":"Eesti Televisioon","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eesti_Televisioon"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
