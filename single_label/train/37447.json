{"id":37447,"title":"Morphological and functional imaging in neurological and non-neurological Wilson's patients.","abstract":"Wilson's disease causes disturbances of the central nervous system, affecting it both directly through copper toxicity and indirectly subject to a copper-induced hepatopathy, resulting in morphological and physiological changes in brain structures that can be captured by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (123)I-?-CIT (2?-carbomethoxy-3? (4-iodophenyl)tropane)-SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), (123)I-IBZM (benzamide)-SPECT and [(18)F]FDG -PET (fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography). MRI can reveal even slight morphological changes in non-neurological Wilson's patients. More marked findings in neurological Wilson's patients become evident in T1- and T2-weighted MRI. T1-weighted MRI predominantly detects atrophic changes, whereas T2-weighted MRI regularly records signal changes in the putamen. With the aid of these three nuclear-medicine examinations, nigrostriatal and metabolic disturbances are identified in neurological Wilson's patients only. Sufficient decoppering therapy prevents progression and even tends to improve symptoms. A correlation between any of the imaging findings in patients with the genetic phenotype and the incidence of the most common mutation H1069Q (homozygote or compound heterozygote) or other mutations could not be substantiated.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
