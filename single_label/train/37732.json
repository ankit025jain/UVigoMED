{"id":37732,"title":"[Type II proatlantal artery with unusual origin of the occipital artery feeding of a type IV dural arteriovenous fistula: case report].","abstract":"We report the case of a 49 year-old woman, who presented with an intracranial haemorrhage. During cerebral angiography investigations, we observed an unusual vertebral artery that originated from the external carotid artery and an uncommon origin of the occipital artery from the vertebral artery feeding a dural arteriovenous fistula grade IV. This rare vertebral artery origin is probably the remnant of a type II proatlantal artery. In addition, the origin of the occipital artery evoked a vascular development disease including a dural arteriovenous fistula which may be the result. These multiple vascular abnormalities could be explained by embryologic disorders.","date":"2014-01-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475494","annotations":[{"name":"External carotid artery","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Vertebral artery","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_artery"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Intracranial hemorrhage","weight":0.766442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_hemorrhage"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.733991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.719549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Occipital artery","weight":0.710117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_artery"},{"name":"Embryology","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryology"},{"name":"Dura mater","weight":0.698509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura_mater"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.650124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.642497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Occipital lobe","weight":0.600465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.532099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Cerebral angiography","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_angiography"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.310352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Arteriovenous fistula","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_fistula"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"}]}
