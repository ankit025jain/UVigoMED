{"id":80917,"title":"Efficacy of two fungus-based biopesticide against the honeybee ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor.","abstract":"The varroa mite, Varroa destructor (Anderson and Trueman) (Acari: Varroidae), is known as the most serious ectoparasitic mite on honeybee, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in the world. Based on the spores of entomopathogenic fungi, two commercial preparations; Bioranza (Metarhizium anisopliae) and Biovar (Beauveria bassiana) were evaluated through application into the hives against varroa mite. Data showed significant differences between treatments with Bioranza and Biovar, the results were significant after 7 and 14 days post-treatment. Mean a daily fallen mite individual was significantly different between the hives before and after the applications of the two biopesticides and wheat flour. Also, mites' mortality was, significantly, different between the hives before and after treatments. There were significant differences between treatments with the two biopesticides in worker's body weight. Bioranza and Biovar did not infect the honeybee in larval, prepupal, pupal and adult stages. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images showed spores and hyphae penetration through stigma and wounds on varroa. The results suggest that Bioranza and Biovar are potentially are effective biopesticides against V. destructor in honeybee colonies.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498835","annotations":[{"name":"Mite","weight":0.901267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"},{"name":"Varroa destructor","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varroa_destructor"},{"name":"Beauveria bassiana","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauveria_bassiana"},{"name":"Honey bee","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bee"},{"name":"Metarhizium anisopliae","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metarhizium_anisopliae"},{"name":"Entomopathogenic fungus","weight":0.867658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomopathogenic_fungus"},{"name":"Hymenoptera","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenoptera"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Acari","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acari"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Pupa","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa"},{"name":"Metarhizium","weight":0.797579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metarhizium"},{"name":"Western honey bee","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_honey_bee"},{"name":"Spore","weight":0.779966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.746453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Hypha","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha"},{"name":"Biological pesticide","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_pesticide"},{"name":"Wheat","weight":0.658814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Colony (biology)","weight":0.354426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_(biology)"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.265993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Transmission electron microscopy","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy"},{"name":"Apidae","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apidae"},{"name":"Biopesticide","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopesticide"},{"name":"Gynoecium","weight":0.154458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynoecium"},{"name":"Varroa","weight":0.130079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varroa"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.103138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Flour","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"}]}
