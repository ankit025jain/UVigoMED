{"id":36982,"title":"A review and update on the current status of retinal prostheses (bionic eye).","abstract":"The Argus® II is the first retinal prosthesis approved for the treatment of patients blind from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), receiving CE (Conformité Européenne) marking in March 2011 and FDA approval in February 2013. Alpha-IMS followed closely and obtained CE marking in July 2013. Other devices are being developed, some of which are currently in clinical trials.A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMED, Google Scholar and IEEExplore.Retinal prostheses play a part in restoring vision in blind RP patients providing stable, safe and long-term retinal stimulation.Objective improvement in visual function does not always translate into consistent improvement in the patient's quality of life. Controversy exists over the use of an external image-capturing device versus internally placed photodiode devices.The alpha-IMS, a photovoltaic-based retinal prosthesis recently obtained its CE marking in July 2013.Improvement in retinal prosthetic vision depends on: (i) improving visual resolution, (ii) improving the visual field, (iii) developing an accurate neural code for image processing and (iv) improving the biocompatibility of the device to ensure longevity.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
