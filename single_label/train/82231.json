{"id":82231,"title":"Pleomorphic adenoma of oral minor salivary glands: An investigation of its neoplastic potential based on apoptosis, mucosecretory activity and cellular proliferation.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the neoplastic potential of the PA of minor oral salivary glands measured by apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax and p53), mucosecretory activity (MUC1), and cellular proliferation (Ki-67).Thirty-one cases of PA of the oral cavity and four controls (C) taken from normal oral minor salivary glands were analyzed using the immunohistochemistry technique. The proteins were detected utilizing a semi-quantitative method (scores) as follows: (-) negative ?5%, (+) low 6-25%, (++) moderate 26-50% and (+++) high >50% of positive tumour cells. The apoptotic indices were evaluated by the ratio Bcl-2/Bax. Non-parametric comparison and correlation tests were used for analysis.The data showed high staining of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in both groups (PA=57.9%; C=67.7%) and a significantly lower expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax (PA=22.7%; C=97.7%) and MUC1 (PA=14%; C=82.3%) in PA than in C (p<0.001). On the other hand, a similar expression of Ki-67 and p53 proteins (?5%) was seen in both PA and C. In PA, only 2/31 cases showed the ratio Bcl-2/Bax<1.There was no difference in cellular expression with regard to clinical variables or clinical outcome (p>0.05).The neoplastic potential of PA could be associated with an imbalance in apoptotic processes and a lower index of cellular proliferation. Mucosecretory activity does not play a significant role in primary PA.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681706","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.83448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.831559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Pleomorphism","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism"},{"name":"Pleomorphic adenoma","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphic_adenoma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Ki-67 (protein)","weight":0.76818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki-67_(protein)"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Salivary gland","weight":0.725661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.70619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.655405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.565434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"MUC1","weight":0.535257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUC1"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Dissociation constant","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
