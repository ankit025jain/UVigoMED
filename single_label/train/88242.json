{"id":88242,"title":"[Volar dislocation of the fifth carpometacarpal joint: a case report].","abstract":"Pure carpo-metacarpal dislocations without any fracture are rare, their volar component is exceptional. Untreated injuries can result in instability and early articular degeneration. We report a 72-year-old female patient who underwent an isolated closed volar dislocation of her fifth finger carpo-metacarpal joint after a fall. The clinical examination showed a 10Â°-defect in rotation with limited adduction (radial deviation). The X-rays showed a gap between the base of the fourth and the fifth metacarpal bones with volar dislocation of the base of the fifth carpometacarpal joint. The dislocation was successfully treated by closed reduction maintained with two K-wires. Immobilisation of the joint was applied for 6 weeks. At 2 years follow-up evaluation, the patient was pain free with no clinico-radiological evidence of instability and had returned to her previous level of activity.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880606","annotations":[{"name":"Carpometacarpal joint","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpometacarpal_joint"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Metacarpus","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpus"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Little finger","weight":0.75702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_finger"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.706934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.509428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Fifth metacarpal bone","weight":0.119627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_metacarpal_bone"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
