{"id":77334,"title":"[Estimating the burden of disease due to permanent disability in Spain during the period 2009-2012].","abstract":"Permanent disability (PD) is a major social and economic burden. The aim of this study was to determine the burden of disease due to PD.Using data from the Continuous Working Life Sample (CWLS) -a random sample consisting of 4% of the active members affiliated to the Social Security (SS) System in Spain (1.1 million members) which data come from administrative registries from the SS- the diagnosis of PD (2009-2012) was established from the information on the temporary sickness absence (TSA) episodes from 2009. The diagnoses were imputed if two criteria were fulfilled: long duration of TSA and short period of time between the TSA episode and PD. The burden of disease was estimated for cases with an established diagnosis of PD by using the potential years of working life lost (PYWLL), estimated as the difference between the legal retirement age (65 years) and the age at the start of a PD.In the CWLS, 163,135 (13.6%9 individuals suffered a TSA episode in 2009, out of which 4,738 were granted a PD pension in the period of 2009-2012. The diagnosis was established for 3,073 (64.9%) cases. A large percentage of PD was produced by musculoskeletal (27.4%) and mental disorders (11.6%), likewise these diagnoses produced more PYWLL due to a PD: 11,086 (26.5%) and 7,052 (16.9%), respectively. Mental disorders produced PD at younger ages (median= 49 years of age).Mental and musculoskeletal disorders represent a major burden of disease produced by PD and measured by PYWLL. The diagnoses of PD should become available in order to estimate with more accuracy the PYWLL produced by PD and specific diagnoses.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25028303","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.811219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.631202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.5941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.586448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pension","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.471548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.298387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.243702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"Social Security (United States)","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)"},{"name":"Retirement","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0375437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Total permanent disability insurance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_permanent_disability_insurance"},{"name":"Musculoskeletal disorder","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musculoskeletal_disorder"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mandatory retirement","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_retirement"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"738","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/738"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Breed registry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed_registry"},{"name":"Imputation (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Working (musical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(musical)"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"}]}
