{"id":71465,"title":"Evaluation of the accuracy of dose delivery for IMRT based on transit dosimetry.","abstract":"The authors have developed and evaluated a new method that uses transit dose in the treatment room in verification of dose delivery to patients. Five intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans were selected from actual cancer patients, and transit dose was measured using MapCHECK 2 and an anthropomorphic phantom. The criteria used as a verification tool for the dose delivery to the patient were gamma-index-based dose comparison between the computed dose and measured dose. When the doses were delivered to an anthropomorphic phantom normally, the average passing rate was 95.2% based on a gamma index analysis. This feasibility study suggested that transit dose-based quality assurance can provide information about the accuracy of an inhomogeneity correction algorithm and patient positioning during treatment, allowing its use as a verification tool for actual dose delivery to patients in the treatment room.
