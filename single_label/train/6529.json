{"id":6529,"title":"Human hematopoietic reconstitution and HLA-restricted responses in nonpermissive alymphoid mice.","abstract":"We generated a new humanized mouse model to study HLA-restricted immune responses. For this purpose, we created unique murine hosts by enforcing the expression of human SIRP? by murine phagocytes in murine MHC-deficient HLA-transgenic alymphoid hosts, an approach that allowed the immune reconstitution of nonpermissive mice following injection of human hematopoietic stem cells. We showed that these mouse/human chimeras were able to generate HLA-restricted responses to immunization. These new humanized mice may offer attractive models to study immune responses to human diseases, such as HIV and EBV infections, as well as to assay new vaccine strategies.
