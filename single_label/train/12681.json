{"id":12681,"title":"Isolation of bovine coronavirus (bcoV) in vero cell line and its confirmation by direct FAT and RT-PCR.","abstract":"Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world. The virus is one of the largest RNA virus and has specific tropism for intestinal and pulmonary epithelial cells. It is responsible for huge economic losses by causing winter dysentery in adult dairy cattle and respiratory and intestinal tract infections leading to pneumo-enteritis in young calves. Isolation of BCoV has been reported to be difficult. Studies regarding epidemiology, virus isolation and molecular detection from India are very few. In the present study Vero cell line was used for isolation of the BCoV from Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) positive samples. Direct florescent antibody technique (dFAT) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to confirm the isolated virus strains at antigenic and genomic levels, respectively. Out of the 15 positive fecal samples, virus from only seven was able to infect vero cell line. Subsequently BCoV got adapted to the vero cell line upto three passages, which was confirmed both at genomic and antigenic levels by dFAT and RT-PCR testing. It can be concluded that vero cell line can be used for isolation of BCoV, however due to the enormous stain diversity of the virus it is possible that many stains can't grow and get adapt in this cell line. Further studies are required for isolation of different viral strains, finding the susceptible cell lines and also to confirm the variations among the BCoV isolates at antigenic/genomic levels.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511744","annotations":[{"name":"Dysentery","weight":0.901316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery"},{"name":"Vero cell","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vero_cell"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.846036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"India","weight":0.768143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.666265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.596721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.546389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.383938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Tropism","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropism"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.233977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.118291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Beef","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Calf","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Winter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Dairy cattle","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle"}]}
