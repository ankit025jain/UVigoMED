{"id":41970,"title":"The role of C-reactive protein in the prediction of the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to investigate the value of C-reactive protein (CRP) and of other laboratory parameters obtained during the initial evaluation of the patient in the prediction of the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis. The records of patients treated for acute diverticulitis at the Oulu University Hospital from December 2006 to December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Mild disease was defined when conservative treatment was successful. Severe acute diverticulitis was considered when percutaneous drainage of an abscess and/or surgery was necessary. From the 182 patients considered for analysis, 158 (87%) had mild disease, whereas 24 (13%) had severe. CRP (P = 0.034) and the Hinchey classification (P = 0.006) were shown to be independent risk factors for severe acute diverticulitis in the logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that a CRP cutoff value of 170 mg/L significantly discriminated severe from mild diverticulitis (87.5% sensitivity, 91.1% specificity, area under the curve 0.942, P < 0.00001). CRP is a useful tool in the prediction of the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis. A mild episode is very likely in patients with CRP less than 170 mg/L. Those with higher CRP values have a greater probability to undergo surgical treatment or at least a percutaneous intervention.
