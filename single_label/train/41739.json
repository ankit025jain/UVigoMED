{"id":41739,"title":"The mean platelet volume is a potential biomarker for cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B virus infected patients.","abstract":"In recent years, a great interest has been dedicated to the development of noninvasive predictive models to substitute liver biopsy for cirrhosis assessment and follow-up. Our aim was to provide a simple marker for predicting liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients based on routinely available clinical parameters.Three hundred and fifty-four patients with chronic hepatitis B, including 144 with cirrhosis, 210 without cirrhosis, and 68 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. During the study, a blood sample was collected from all cases to examine liver function, renal function, international normalized ratio (INR) and routine hematological testing.We demonstrated that in the cirrhosis group, mean platelet volume (MPV) values were significantly increased compared with healthy controls and non-cirrhosis group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that MPV, total bilirubin (TB) and INR were independent predictors for cirrhosis (both P < 0.01).MPV is a simple and non-invasive routine laboratory parameters and elevated MPV level might be an independent predictor for cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection.","date":"2014-06-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901161","annotations":[{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Prothrombin time","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.835593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.822622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.621151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.579805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
