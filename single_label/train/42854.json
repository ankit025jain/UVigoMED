{"id":42854,"title":"[Radiotherapy in rectal cancer: when, why and how?].","abstract":"Since several decades, radiotherapy plays a crucial role in the management and local control of the rectal adenocarcinoma. The local recurrences pattern of the rectal tumor has completely changed with the systematic use of the Total Mesorectal Excision surgery (TME). In this context, the rate of radiotherapy needs to be reviewed. In this article we propose an overview of the main studies using radiotherapy in a pre- or post-operative setting in the context ofTME surgery. This will help to better define the indications of radiotherapy in rectal cancer.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24822304","annotations":[{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.136645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0900983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
