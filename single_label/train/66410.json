{"id":66410,"title":"Delivery of EZH2-shRNA with mPEG-PEI nanoparticles for the treatment of prostate cancer in vitro.","abstract":"Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising therapeutic approach for castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa). For the clinical application of siRNA, it is vital to find a safe and efficient gene transfer vector. Nanotechnology can provide a crucial advantage in developing strategies for cancer management and treatment by helping to improve the safety and efficacy of new therapeutic delivery vehicles. In this study, we describe a novel nanoparticle (mPEG-PEI) as an efficient non-viral carrier and found that this copolymer displayed enhanced efficiency in the shRNA-mediated knockdown of target genes. The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is often elevated in castration-resistant PCa and has been implicated in the progression of human PCa. Targeting EZH2 may have therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of metastatic, hormone-refractory PCa. mPEG-PEI binds plasmid DNA yielding nanoparticles and these complexes exhibit low cytotoxicity and high gene transfection efficiency. Taken together, mPEG-PEI may be a promising non-viral gene carrier for the delivery of EZH2 short hairpin (sh)RNA to PC3 cells for advanced PCa therapy.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714818","annotations":[{"name":"Nanoparticle","weight":0.893794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.842255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.813295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Horizontal gene transfer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.695423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Copolymer","weight":0.540281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer"},{"name":"Enhancer (genetics)","weight":0.443488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_(genetics)"},{"name":"Stem-loop","weight":0.338497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.223833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Small hairpin RNA","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hairpin_RNA"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.165123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0495178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Gene delivery","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_delivery"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"PC3","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC3"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Automobile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}]}
