{"id":70203,"title":"Modification of ASC1 by UFM1 is crucial for ER? transactivation and breast cancer development.","abstract":"Biological roles for UFM1, a ubiquitin-like protein, are largely unknown, and therefore we screened for targets of ufmylation. Here we show that ufmylation of the nuclear receptor coactivator ASC1 is a key step for ER? transactivation in response to 17?-estradiol (E2). In the absence of E2, the UFM1-specific protease UfSP2 was bound to ASC1, which maintains ASC1 in a nonufmylated state. In the presence of E2, ER? bound ASC1 and displaced UfSP2, leading to ASC1 ufmylation. Polyufmylation of ASC1 enhanced association of p300, SRC1, and ASC1 at promoters of ER? target genes. ASC1 overexpression or UfSP2 knockdown promoted ER?-mediated tumor formation in vivo, which could be abrogated by treatment with the anti-breast cancer drug tamoxifen. In contrast, expression of ufmylation-deficient ASC1 mutant or knockdown of the UFM1-activating E1 enzyme UBA5 prevented tumor growth. These findings establish a role for ASC1 ufmylation in breast cancer development by promoting ER? transactivation.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25219498","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.897676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Coactivator (genetics)","weight":0.772305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coactivator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.74088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Transactivation","weight":0.737545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactivation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.625798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Endoplasmic reticulum","weight":0.587826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.518116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"EP300","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EP300"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.340731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.227481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.0550013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"},{"name":"Elimination reaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_reaction"}]}
