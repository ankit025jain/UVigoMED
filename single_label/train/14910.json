{"id":14910,"title":"Current aspects of thiamine deficiency on heart function.","abstract":"Beriberi is a disease caused by thiamine deficiency (TD), which may lead to heart problems, including heart failure. Despite the fact that thiamine prevalence is reduced in the industrialized world, it remains a health hazard especially due to chronic alcohol consumption. Diagnosing the presence of TD based on both electrocardiogram and echocardiogram exams is particularly challenging because of its non-specific symptoms. TD diagnosis is unique, which then leads to determination of its severity. If thiamine infusion abrogates its symptomology, only then can the case be definitely diagnosed as TD. Another condition eliciting increased likelihood of developing TD in humans is furosemide administration to heart failure patients. Furosemide administration worsens heart failure due to heightened TD. However, literature data provided are contradictory and require clarification. Up until now, the rat has been the preferred TD animal model. However, the results are even more contradictory than those in humans. It seems that if the rat TD models are separated into two distinct groups, according to animal age, the results appear to be more consistent: younger rats are more prone to develop TD signs similar to those found in humans. Their symptoms stem from changes in cardiac myocyte function that are reversed after thiamine supplementation. However, it remains an open question as to why only younger rats are able to develop human-like symptoms and deserve further investigation.
