{"id":89587,"title":"\"Good-old-days\" bias: a prospective follow-up study to examine the preinjury supernormal status in patients with mild traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"Postconcussion symptoms (PCS) are common following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). A psychological misperception, the \"good-old-days\" bias, has been indicated as one of the influencing factors on symptom reporting after injury. To date, this response bias has only been examined in a small number of cross-sectional studies. This study thus prospectively evaluated the \"good-old-days\" bias in patients with mTBI.A prospective follow-up study.Fifty-three patients with mTBI were recruited in this study. The PCS was evaluated by the modified Checklist of Postconcussion Symptoms (mCPCS) at 1 month post injury. Twenty-five patients were evaluated again at 3 months after injuries. In addition, 53 healthy participants were also evaluated for the PCS, and 23 of them underwent a second evaluation at 2 months after the first one.Patients with mTBI showed significantly higher PCS reporting at 1 month post injury than healthy participants did, but not at 3 months post injury. Consistent with the \"good-old-days\" bias, patients remarkably underestimated their preinjury PCS at 1 month post injury. Interestingly, our results further revealed that this response bias diminished more at 3 months than at 1 month after mTBI.This study thus might be the first one to prospectively reveal the progression of the \"good-old-days\" bias in patients with mTBI.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702428","annotations":[{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.925469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.796077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.722957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.653926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Response bias","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Supernatural","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Post-concussion syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-concussion_syndrome"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"}]}
