{"id":68652,"title":"Radical retropubic prostatectomy--initial experience.","abstract":"To evaluate our experience with the first cases of radical retropubic prostatectomy and to use the results for patient counseling and optimizing therapeutic decision.In the interval January 2011 - December 2012, 23 patients aged 56-69 years (mean age 62.6 years) were treated by radical retropubic prostatectomy. The retrospective study included an analysis of the significant data in the case records, surgical protocols and outpatient postoperative check-ups, special attention being given to indications, intra- and early postoperative complications (within 30 days) and hospital stay.Preoperatively, prostate specific antigen (PSA) ranged between 4.5 and 27.2 ng/ml (mean 9.5 ng/ml), and Gleason score was 5 in one patient, 6 in 20, and 7 in 2 patients. Clinical stage was T1 in 5 patients (21.7%), T2 in 16 (69.6%) and T3 in 2 (8.7%). Mean intraoperative blood loss was 1214 ml (range 400-2500 ml), and 17 patients received blood transfusions. Postoperative complications included acute renal failure and extravasation of contrast medium during retrograde cystography in 3 cases each, urinary infection in 4 patients and wound dehiscence in 1 case. The average postoperative hospital stay was 19.57 days (range 13-43).Radical retropubic prostatectomy is a safe technique, involving a reduced risk of complications. For most patients with localized prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy is the best treatment option.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital
