{"id":67492,"title":"Sleep fragmentation and increased periodic limb movements are more common in children with nocturnal enuresis.","abstract":"To determine sleep fragmentation in children with nocturnal enuresis (NE).Paediatricians assessed NE parameters in children referred to an enuresis clinic. Control subjects, matched by age and gender and without incontinence or (un)treated NE, were recruited from the paediatric sleep clinic regardless of their sleep problem. Sleep was investigated by one overnight video-polysomnography in both groups.The study group comprised 67 children with proven NE (50 boys and 17 girls between six and 16 years: 11.1 ± 2.8 SD). They were matched with 67 control subjects (47 boys and 20 girls aged between six and 16 years: 11.0 ± 2.9 SD). Children with NE had a higher incidence of periodic limb movements associated with cortical arousals in their sleep. They displayed significant higher periodic limb movement index, arousal index and awakening index than the control group.Children with NE displayed higher sleep fragmentation and periodic limb movements in sleep than the control children with a possible sleep disorder without NE. The findings emphasise the central involvement of the pathophysiology of NE and the multifactorial nature of the condition.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24612370","annotations":[{"name":"Nocturnal enuresis","weight":0.891569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_enuresis"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.701811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.583754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.571808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Enuresis","weight":0.424048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuresis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.36118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Periodic limb movement disorder","weight":0.311276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_limb_movement_disorder"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.235845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Arousal","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Nebraska Highway 50","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Highway_50"},{"name":"Nocturnality","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Movement (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(music)"},{"name":"Wakefulness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefulness"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
