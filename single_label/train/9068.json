{"id":9068,"title":"Efficacy of anti-nerve growth factor therapy for discogenic neck pain in rats.","abstract":"Immunohistological analysis of the cervical dorsal root ganglia (DRG).To investigate immunohistologically in rats whether intradiscal administration of anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) antibody in injured cervical intervertebral discs (IVDs) suppresses pain-related peptide expression in DRG neurons.Neck pain can involve the entire neck and become chronic and intractable. Cervical disc degeneration is a primary cause of neck pain, and pain-related mediators, such as NGF, have been correlated with discogenic pain.We examined Sprague-Dawley rats that received 10 punctures in the C5-C6 IVD, and were treated with saline (puncture group) or an anti-NGF antibody (anti-NGF group). The retrograde neurotracer Fluoro-Gold (FG) was then injected into the C5-C6 IVD. In addition, we examined a sham group that did not receive punctures (disc nonpuncture). The C2-C7 DRG were harvested 1 week after surgery and immunostained for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a marker for peptide-containing neurons. We determined for each group the percentages of FG-labeled DRG neurons that were CGRP-immunoreactive (CGRP-ir).FG-labeled neurons innervating the C5-C6 IVD were found in all C2-C7 DRG examined. The percentage of FG-labeled CGRP-ir DRG neurons in the puncture group was significantly higher than that observed in the sham (P < 0.001) and anti-NGF groups (P < 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the sham and anti-NGF groups (P > 0.05). Therefore, intradiscal administration of anti-NGF antibody suppressed CGRP expression the cervical DRG.Neurons located in the C2-C7 DRG innervated the C5-C6 IVD. These findings indicate that neck pain may be derived from degenerated IVDs. Furthermore, intradiscal administration of anti-NGF antibody suppressed CGRP expression in the cervical DRG innervating the injured IVD. Therefore, inhibiting NGF upregulation in the cervical IVD may be an efficient treatment for discogenic neck pain.N/A.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Animal
