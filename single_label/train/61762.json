{"id":61762,"title":"Heat shock proteins in multiple myeloma.","abstract":"Heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones with a central role in protein folding and cellular protein homeostasis. They also play major roles in the development of cancer and in recent years have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. In this review, we discuss the known molecular mechanisms of various heat shock protein families and their involvement in cancer and in particular, multiple myeloma. In addition, we address the current progress and challenges in pharmacologically targeting these proteins as anti-cancer therapeutic strategies.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675290","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.728188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Heat shock protein","weight":0.723939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock_protein"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.713597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.541392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chaperone (protein)","weight":0.428984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(protein)"},{"name":"Protein family","weight":0.23813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.19543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Heat shock","weight":0.0157616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock"}]}
