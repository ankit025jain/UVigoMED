{"id":37422,"title":"Comparison of method of conception in fetuses undergoing echocardiography at a tertiary referral center.","abstract":"We compared the proportion of conception with and without in vitro fertilization (IVF) in fetuses with and without congenital heart disease (CHD).This was a retrospective review of fetal echocardiograms at Columbia University from 2007 to 2010, to identify the mode of conception.Echocardiography was performed on 2828 fetuses, and 2761 (97.6%) had the method of conception documented. CHD was diagnosed in 22.4%, consisting predominantly of complex CHD. The proportion of IVF conception was lower in fetuses with CHD (6.9% CHD vs 10.3% no CHD, OR?=?0.65 [95% CI 0.46-0.92], p?=?0.01). IVF fetuses were conceived by elder mothers and were more likely part of a multiple gestation than those without IVF. In a multivariate model controlling for maternal age and multiple gestation, IVF was not associated with CHD diagnosis (OR?=?1.1 [95% CI 0.77-1.7], p?=?0.51).At a tertiary referral center, fetuses with CHD were not more likely to be conceived by IVF after controlling for maternal age and multiple gestation. These results differ from those of several previous reports, which may be related to our study population, and the exclusion of isolated atrial shunts and patent ductus arteriosus, which are normal fetal findings.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496858","annotations":[{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.826384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Patent ductus arteriosus","weight":0.817494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.81544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.780734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.778183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.625531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.60503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Ductus arteriosus","weight":0.578368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.50652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Columbia University","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.322652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Multiple birth","weight":0.318736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_birth"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Shunt (medical)","weight":0.112081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunt_(medical)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Advanced maternal age","weight":0.0179676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
