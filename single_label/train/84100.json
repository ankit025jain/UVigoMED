{"id":84100,"title":"Computed tomography of iatrogenic complications of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, stenting, and intubation.","abstract":"Intraluminal procedures for the gastrointestinal tract range from simple intubation for feeding or bowel decompression to endoscopic procedures including stenting and pancreatobiliary ductal catheterization. Each of these procedures and interventions carries a risk of iatrogenic injury, including bleeding, perforation, infection, adhesions, and obstruction. An understanding of how anatomy and function may predispose to injury, and the distinct patterns of injury, can help the radiologist identify and characterize iatrogenic injury rapidly at computed tomography (CT) imaging. Furthermore, selective use of intravenous or oral CT contrast material can help reveal injury and triage clinical management.
