{"id":83739,"title":"[Clinical outcome of posterior approach 360째 vertebral canal decompression for ossifying thoracic disc herniation].","abstract":"To evaluate the clinical results and the value of the posterior approach 360째 vertebral canal decompression and transfacet discectomy combined with interbody fusion and pedicle screw internal fixation for the treatment of ossifying thoracic disc herniation.Thirty nine cases of ossifying thoracic disc herniation who accepted the posterior approach 360째 vertebral canal decompression and transfacet discectomy combined with interbody fusion and pedicle screw internal fixation were included in this study. There were 21 male and 18 female patients. The age ranged from 33 to 69 years, with an average of 53 years. The course of disease ranged from 1 month to 18 months, with an average of 6.5 months. The lesion locations were T7-8 for 1 case, T8-9 for 4 cases, T9-10 for 9 cases, T10-11 for 7 cases, T11-12 for 10 cases, T12-L1 for 6 cases, and both T11-12 and T12-L1 for 2 cases. The clinical results were evaluated by Otani scored system.The operative time was from 2.5 to 5.0 hours, with average of 3.3 hours. The blood loss was from 400 to 2 000 ml, with average of 850 ml. All patients were successfully operated without neurological symptoms aggravation and accidents. The followed-up period was 24 to 60 months, mean 40.5 months. According to Otani scored system, there were excellent results in 16 cases and good results in 18 cases. The clinical satisfaction rate was 87.2%. All obtained bony fusion without instrument failure.Posterior approach 360째 vertebral canal decompression and transfacet discectomy combined with interbody fusion and pedicle screw internal fixation is a safe and effective surgical procedure for the treatment of ossifying thoracic disc herniation.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25262608","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Spinal canal","weight":0.551618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_canal"},{"name":"Posterior (anatomy)","weight":0.548554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.373576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.278431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Discectomy","weight":0.131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discectomy"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"}]}
