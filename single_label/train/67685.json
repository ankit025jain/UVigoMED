{"id":67685,"title":"[Rechallenge of everolimus for metastatic renal cell carcinoma after recovery from grade 3 interstitial lung disease: a case report].","abstract":"We report a case of the rechallenge of everolimus for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after successful recovery from grade 3 interstitial lung disease (ILD). A 76-year-old man with metastatic RCC developed grade 3 ILD one month after the initiation of everolimus therapy (10 mg/day). ILD subsided in 4 months after the withdrawal of everolimus and treatment with corticosteroids. Half dose (5 mg/day) of everolimus was rechallenged for 9 months until another grade 3 ILD developed. Everolimus kept the disease under control for 13 months including the discontinuation period.
