{"id":36906,"title":"Panduratin A, an activator of PPAR-?/?, suppresses the development of oxazolone-induced atopic dermatitis-like symptoms in hairless mice.","abstract":"Panduratin A isolated from Boesenbergia pandurata (Roxb.) has been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic activities. However, the effect of panduratin A on atopic dermatitis (AD) has not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of panduratin A, an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) ?/?, using oxazolone-induced AD-like model in hairless mice.To determine PPAR?/? activation of panduratin A, HaCaT, Hs68, and COS-7 cells were treated with panduratin A, then PPAR?/? and PPAR response element (PPRE) activities were assessed with a reporter gene assay. For the in vivo study, oral administration of panduratin A was performed for 4weeks, with oxazolone treatment every other day. The efficacy of panduratin A on parameters of oxazolone-induced AD was assessed physiologically, morphologically, and immunologically.Panduratin A increased PPAR?/? and PPRE activation both in vitro and in vivo. Panduratin A attenuated dermatitis-associated barrier damage as demonstrated by transepidermal water loss, erythema, and filaggrin expression. Furthermore, infiltration of inflammatory cells and epidermal thickness in the skin were decreased. Panduratin A decreased serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E and interleukin-4 levels but increased IgG2a and interferon-? levels. In addition, panduratin A decreased inflammation-associated molecules in the skin. Panduratin A also decreased Th2-associated molecules and increased Th1/regulatory T cell (Treg)-associated molecules in the spleen.Panduratin A showed a beneficial effect on AD by modulating Th1/Th2/Treg-associated immune response and is a potential candidate for treating AD.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
