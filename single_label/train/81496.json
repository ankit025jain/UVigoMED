{"id":81496,"title":"Three-year prospective clinical performance of a one-step self-etch adhesive and a nanofiller hybrid resin composite in Class V lesions.","abstract":"This 3-year prospective clinical study evaluated the clinical performance of a one-step self-etching adhesive (Futurabond NR) in combination with a nanohybrid composite (Grandio) for the treatment of different Class V cavities.122 restorations were placed in 42 patients (mean age of 54 +/- 13.2 years) evaluated according to modified Ryge-criteria at baseline, 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years. The lesions comprised 91 Class V non-caries cervical lesions (NCCL) and 31 Class V cavities due to caries or restoration replacement. While carious lesions as well as restoration replacement required preparation of dentin, it was not roughened in case of NCCL. Macro-mechanical retention with undercuts was not used. The statistical analysis was carried out based on Bonferroni adjusted McNemar test (global alpha = 0.05) including the criteria marginal adaptation, color match, surface texture, anatomical form, retention and clinical acceptance and pain. The occurrence of secondary caries, preoperative and postoperative sensitivity was also examined.After 3 years of clinical service the restorations showed a significant deterioration of all studied parameters. After 3 years, 65% of the restorations were rated as excellent or acceptable in terms of clinical acceptance, 9% appeared tolerable and 26% were rated as not acceptable which mainly resulted from restoration losses. Within the observed timeframe the retention rate decreased to 75%, which means that 30 out of the 122 restorations were partially or completely lost. There was a difference in the 3-year retention rate of NCCL (71%) and the caries/restoration replacement group (87%) but it was not statistically significant.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000664","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.716385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.663432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.646441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.536003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.402995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.277288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"McNemar's test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNemar's_test"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Conservation-restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-restoration"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Timeline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline"},{"name":"Texture mapping","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_mapping"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Marginal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution"},{"name":"Carlo Emilio Bonferroni","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Emilio_Bonferroni"},{"name":"Retention rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_rate"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Clinical governance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_governance"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Surface finish","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_finish"},{"name":"Undercut (manufacturing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undercut_(manufacturing)"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Liberty (pressure group)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_(pressure_group)"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Alpha particle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"}]}
