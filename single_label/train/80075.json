{"id":80075,"title":"[Laboratory detection on two cases with imported Plasmodium ovale infection].","abstract":"To compare the laboratory tests of the imported Plasmodium ovale infection and analyse the genetic character.After Giemsa staining and microscopy, CareStart rapid detection and nested PCR were used to detect two cases with P. ovale infection returning from Congo (Brazzaville) in Henan Province. Sequencing was performed after PCR amplification using the 18S rRNA genus-specific primers. Their genetic characteristics were analyzed and the sequence homology analysis was performed in the NCBI.The two cases were confirmed as P. ovale infection by morphological examination microscopically. Amplified bands were produced by 18S rRNA nested PCR, which was the same with P. ovale in size, whereas the results of CareStart rapid detection test were all negative. A sequence of 906 bp in length was obtained by sequencing their 18S rRNA genes in which GC accounted for 35.4%, and the sequence showed 99% homology to the corresponding part of the known P. ovale 18S rRNA gene (GenBank accession No. AB182492).Both the nested PCR and microscopy confirm the infection of P. ovale. A negative result of CareStart rapid detection can not ruled out the Plasmodium infection.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809194","annotations":[{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.803593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"GenBank","weight":0.794008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenBank"},{"name":"Giemsa stain","weight":0.767467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giemsa_stain"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.716131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.648698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"National Center for Biotechnology Information","weight":0.617115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.358068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Plasmodium","weight":0.165522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"False negative","weight":0.0485303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_negative"},{"name":"Plasmodium ovale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale"},{"name":"Nested polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Republic of the Congo","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo"},{"name":"18S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
