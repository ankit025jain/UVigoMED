{"id":66615,"title":"Evaluation of molecular profiles in calcineurin inhibitor toxicity post-kidney transplant: input to chronic allograft dysfunction.","abstract":"The molecular basis of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity (CNIT) in kidney transplantation (KT) and its contribution to chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) with interstitial fibrosis (IF) and tubular atrophy (TA) were evaluated by: (1) identifying specific CNIT molecular pathways that associate with allograft injury (cross-sectional study) and (2) assessing the contribution of the identified CNIT signature in the progression to CAD with IF/TA (longitudinal study). Kidney biopsies from well-selected transplant recipients with histological diagnosis of CNIT (n = 14), acute rejection (n = 13) and CAD with IF/TA (n = 10) were evaluated. Normal allografts (n = 18) were used as controls. To test CNIT contribution to CAD progression, an independent set of biopsies (n = 122) from 61 KT patients collected at 3 and ~12 months post-KT (range = 9-18) were evaluated. Patients were classified based on 2-year post-KT graft function and histological findings as progressors (n = 30) or nonprogressors to CAD (n = 31). Molecular signatures characterizing CNIT samples were identified. Patients classified as progressors showed an overlap of 7% and 22% with the CNIT signature at 3 and at ~12 months post-KT, respectively, while the overlap was <1% and 1% in nonprogressor patients, showing CNIT at the molecular level as a nonimmunological factor involved in the progression to CAD.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698514","annotations":[{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.858731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.821722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.789135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Calcineurin","weight":0.735098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.632985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.586928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.577993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.57747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.508692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Calcineurin inhibitor","weight":0.36624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcineurin_inhibitor"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Computer-aided design","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"},{"name":"Order of the Thistle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Thistle"},{"name":"Independent set (graph theory)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)"},{"name":"Center of New Industries and Technologies","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_New_Industries_and_Technologies"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Progressor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressor"},{"name":"Irish Film and Television Awards","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Film_and_Television_Awards"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"918","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/918"},{"name":"Intermediate frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_frequency"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Territorial Army (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
