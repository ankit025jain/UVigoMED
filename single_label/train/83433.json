{"id":83433,"title":"[Effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on gut microbiota and endotoxin levels in portal vein of rats fed with high-fat diet].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs) on gut microbiota and endotoxin levels in portal vein of rats fed with a high-fat diet (HFD).Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups and fed with normal control diet (CD), HFD, CD supplemented with n-3PUFAs, and HFD supplemented with n-3PUFAs, respectively. Fresh fecal samples were collected to analyze the gut microbiota 10 weeks after feeding. DNA was exacted from the fresh fecal samples. Quantitative PCR was used to detect the composition of the gut microbiota. The endotoxin levels were detected through modified azo chromogenic substrate limulus amebocyte lysate assay.The differences in body weight before breeding in each group were not statistically significant among these four groups (P=0.613). The increase in the body weight was significantly larger in the HFD group than in the CD group (P=0.0002), CD+n-3PUFAs group (P=0.0001), and HFD+n-3PUFAs group (P=0.022). There were significantly more firmicutes (P=0.002) and enterobacteriales (P=0.022) and significantly less bacteroidetes (P=0.026) and bifidobactera (P=0.034) in the gut of rats from HFD group than those from the CD group. There were significantly more bacteroidetes in the fecal samples of the rats from the CD+n-3PUFAs group compared to those from the CD group (P=0.043). There were significantly more firmicutes (P=0.044)and enterobacteriales (P=0.012) and less bacteroidetes (P=0.042) in the fecal samples of the rats from HFD group compared to those from the HFD+n-3PUFAs group. The endotoxin in plasma form portal vein of rats in HFD group were significantly higher than in CD group (P=0.007) and HFD+n-3PUFAs group (P=0.042) but showed no significant difference between CD+n-3PUFAs and CD group (P=0.210).HFD can increase body weight and change gut microbiota. Supplementation of n-3PUFAs can partially counteract such gut dysbiosis, lower endotoxin level in portal vein blood, and improve the body weight.","date":"2014-11-01","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25360646","annotations":[{"name":"Endotoxin","weight":0.922386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotoxin"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.80736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.801894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.764015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Enzyme substrate (biology)","weight":0.742034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_substrate_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.662937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.563544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Gut (anatomy)","weight":0.436479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Firmicutes","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmicutes"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.130186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Chromogenic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromogenic"},{"name":"Dysbiosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbiosis"},{"name":"Amebocyte","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amebocyte"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fat","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"James Bond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Houston Fire Department","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Fire_Department"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Azo compound","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azo_compound"},{"name":"Flora (microbiology)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(microbiology)"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"}]}
