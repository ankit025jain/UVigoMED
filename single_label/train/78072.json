{"id":78072,"title":"Inhibitory effect of N-acetyl cysteine and ascorbic acid on the development of myringosclerosis: an experimental study.","abstract":"This study investigated the effects of ascorbic acid and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) antioxidants on the development of myringosclerosis (MS) in an experimental model.Myringotomies were performed in the ears of 15 guinea pigs, and Spongostan pieces were placed on the perforated regions of the tympanic membrane. The subjects were divided randomly into three groups and treated with three different solutions on the Spongostan-group 1: (control, 0.9% saline), group 2 (ascorbic acid), and group 3 (NAC). On day 15 after treatment, specimens from the tympanic membranes were obtained and examined via light microscopy. Sclerosis and inflammation scores and the tympanic membrane thicknesses were evaluated. Immunohistochemical methods were used to evaluate the expression of VEGF, TGF-?, iNOS, and IL1-? in all groups.Lower sclerosis and inflammation scores and reduced tympanic membrane thicknesses were observed in groups treated with NAC or ascorbic acid compared with the control group. Immunohistochemical studies revealed significantly less expression of VEGF, TGF-?, and iNOS in groups 2 and 3 compared with group 1. Additionally, IL1-? expression was significantly less in group 3 than in group 1. Compared with group 1, group 2 animals exhibited reduced inflammation in the lamina propria, fewer active fibroblasts, less leukocyte infiltration, and decreased thickness of the vessels; group 3 animals exhibited decreased numbers of active fibroblasts and collagen fibers in the lamina propria.Inflammation scores, cellular infiltration, and expression of VEGF, TGF-?, and iNOS were reduced by ascorbic acid and/or NAC treatments, thereby decreasing MS development. Decreased expression of IL1-? was observed only in animals treated with NAC.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794623","annotations":[{"name":"Ascorbic acid","weight":0.901657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascorbic_acid"},{"name":"Lamina propria","weight":0.823868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamina_propria"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.7654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Model organism","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Light microscopy","weight":0.6467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_microscopy"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.590704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Nitric oxide synthase","weight":0.561342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide_synthase"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.544884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.525444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.417046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.366486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.315692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.291803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0809308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Guinea pig","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Eardrum","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eardrum"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"}]}
