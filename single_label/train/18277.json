{"id":18277,"title":"[Acute gastric mucosal lesions caused by acute Helicobacter pylori infection -clinical outcomes of six cases and problems in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection].","abstract":"We analyzed the ratio of positive test results in various diagnostic methods for Helicobacter pylori infection and the clinical presentations in six cases of acute gastric mucosal lesions (AGML) caused by acute H. pylori. At onset, five cases tested negative for serum antibodies; one had a positive result, but the antibody titer increased with time. Some false negative results were obtained with the following tests: urea breath test, rapid urease test, microscopy, culture, and immunostaining; however, the feces antigen test gave positive results in all five cases. These data suggest that feces antigen test should be performed in all cases suspected of acute H. pylori infection. Where progress was monitored without eradication therapy, subjective symptoms were exacerbated in some patients, and one patient developed a persistent infection. Consequently, eradication therapy should be performed at an early stage of AGML.
