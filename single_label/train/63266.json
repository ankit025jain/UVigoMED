{"id":63266,"title":"Fluconazole associated agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia.","abstract":"We describe a second case of fluconazole associated agranulocytosis with thrombocytopenia and recovery upon discontinuation of therapy. The patient began to have changes in white blood cells and platelets within 48 h of administration of fluconazole and began to recover with 48 h of discontinuation. This case highlights that drug-induced blood dyscrasias can occur unexpectedly as a result of treatment with a commonly used drug thought to be \"safe\".According to Naranjo's algorithm the likelihood that our patient's agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia occurred as a result of therapy with fluconazole is probable, with a total of six points. We feel that the weight of the overall evidence of this evidence is strong. In particular the temporal relationship of bone marrow suppression to the initiation of fluconazole and the abatement of symptoms that rapidly reversed immediately following discontinuation.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459006","annotations":[{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Agranulocytosis","weight":0.821334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agranulocytosis"},{"name":"Bone marrow suppression","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_suppression"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Blood cell","weight":0.370048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Dyscrasia","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyscrasia"},{"name":"Discontinuation","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discontinuation"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"White people","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"}]}
