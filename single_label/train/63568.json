{"id":63568,"title":"Development of taxane-containing chemotherapy of doxorubicin-resistant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","abstract":"Recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presents a significant challenge in the clinic, which necessitates the development of alternative therapeutic regimens. Here, we quantified the growth inhibition rate of a panel of clinically approved anticancer drugs in a patient-derived DLBCL cell line that is resistant to doxorubicin, a central component of the standard of care R-CHOP. Our study indicates that this cell line is especially sensitive to two taxanes, docetaxel and paclitaxel. Furthermore, the effective dose of taxane can be lowered when it is combined with other anticancer drugs. Our study provides guidance for preclinical studies to test alternative regimens for recurrent DLBCL.
