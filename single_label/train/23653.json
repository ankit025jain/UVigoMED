{"id":23653,"title":"Efficacy and safety of 1 % terbinafine film-forming solution in Chinese patients with tinea pedis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study.","abstract":"Superficial fungal skin infections are treated using topical antifungals. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of a single application of 1 % terbinafine film-forming solution (FFS) versus placebo for the treatment of tinea pedis in the Chinese population.Six centers in China randomized 290 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 1 % terbinafine FFS or FFS vehicle (placebo) once on the affected foot/feet. Efficacy assessments included microscopy and mycologic culture, and assessing clinical signs and symptoms at baseline, and at weeks 1 and 6 after the topical treatment. All adverse events were recorded.At week 6, 1 % terbinafine FFS was superior to placebo for effective treatment rate (63 vs. 8 %); clinical cure (30 vs. 6 %); mycological cure (86 vs. 12 %); negative microscopy (90 vs. 24 %); and negative mycological culture (90 vs. 27 %): all p ? 0.001 and clinically relevant. At week 6, 1 % terbinafine FFS was clinically superior to placebo for the absence of: erythema (69 vs. 29 %); desquamation (33 vs. 8 %); and pruritus (70 vs. 30 %): all p ? 0.001 and clinically relevant. At week 6, differences in the average total signs and symptoms scores were significantly lower for 1 % terbinafine FFS versus placebo (p ? 0.001). Both 1 % terbinafine FFS and placebo were safe and well tolerated based on adverse events and investigator and patient assessments.This double-blind, randomized, multicenter study demonstrated one single topical application of 1 % terbinafine FFS was safe and effective in the treatment of tinea pedis in the Chinese population.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477462","annotations":[{"name":"Itch","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.814491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.764484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"China","weight":0.673931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.668684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.651693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.630781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.564519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.532968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.512757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Terbinafine","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terbinafine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.276491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mycology","weight":0.255845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycology"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.255301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Athlete's foot","weight":0.243789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete's_foot"},{"name":"Mycosis","weight":0.227058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycosis"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.123071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.111485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tinea","weight":0.0337842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea"},{"name":"Desquamation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desquamation"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"},{"name":"Vehicle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Detective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
