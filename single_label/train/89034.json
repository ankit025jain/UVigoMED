{"id":89034,"title":"[An existential-phenomenological approach to consciousness].","abstract":"The human beings are characterized as subjects. Their essence is understood as Person. A treatment which does not consider the subjective and the Person would not correspond their essence. For a feeling and autonomous being, consciousness plays a role but cannot fully correspond the being a person. This has a therapeutic impact on the treatment of unconscious patients and gives the treatment a specific access. Some instructions for the therapeutic application of the phenomenological-existential concept and the phenomenological attitude towards unconscious or brain traumatized patients are given. The role of consciousness for being human is briefly reflected from an existential perspective.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761600","annotations":[{"name":"Existentialism","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism"},{"name":"Unconscious mind","weight":0.812699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_mind"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Person","weight":0.720071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Phenomenology (philosophy)","weight":0.580892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Essence","weight":0.40749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Autonomy","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0505576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"}]}
