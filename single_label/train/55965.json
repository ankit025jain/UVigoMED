{"id":55965,"title":"Ranibizumab treatment in age-related macular degeneration: a meta-analysis of one-year results.","abstract":"Although ranibizumab is widely used in age-related macular degeneration there is no systematic data available on the relation between treatment frequency and functional efficacy within the first 12 months of follow-up.A meta-analysis was performed on available MEDLINE literature. 47 relevant clinical studies (54 case series) could be identified covering 11706 treated eyes. Non-linear and linear regressions were calculated for the relation between treatment frequency and functional outcome (average gain in visual acuity, % of eyes losing less than 15 letters of visual acuity, % of eyes gaining ? 15 letters) within the first year of care.Mean improvement of average visual gain was +4.9 ± 3.6 (mean ± 1 standard deviation) letters (case-weighted: 3.3 letters). The average number of ranibizumab injections until month 12 was 6.3 ± 2.0 (case-weighted: 5.9). 92.4 ± 3.9% of eyes (case-weighted: 91.9%) lost less than three lines of visual acuity and 24.5 ± 8.2% (case-weighted: 23.3) gained more than 3 lines within the first year. Analysis of the relation between the number of injections and functional improvement indicated best fit for non-linear equations. A nearly stepwise improvement of functional gain occurred between 6.8 and 7.2 injections/year. A saturation effect of treatment occurred at higher injection frequency.The results of this meta-analysis clearly indicate a non-linear relation between the number of injections and functional gain of ranibizumab within the first 12 months of treatment. Treatment saturation seems to occur at a treatment frequency >7.2 injections within the first 12 months.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771184","annotations":[{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.748753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.443034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.275104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.271614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.215637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Curve fitting","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Nonlinear system","weight":0.0775986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.054394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0535955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Ranibizumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranibizumab"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0211494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Humidity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Functional (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Systematic error","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_error"},{"name":"Stepwise regression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Degeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration"}]}
