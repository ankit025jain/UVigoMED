{"id":79637,"title":"Four new species of coccidia (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) from Owen Stanley Skinks, Papuascincus stanleyanus (Sauria: Scincidae), from Papua New Guinea.","abstract":"Between September and November 1991, 12 Owen Stanley skinks, Papuascincus stanleyanus (Booulenger) were collected from various localities on Papua New Guinea and examined for coccidians. Six (50%) were found to harbour four eimerians that we describe here as new. Oocysts of Eimeria burseyi sp. n. were elongate to ellipsoidal with a bilayered wall and measured (length x width, L x W) 36.0 x 24.0 microm, with a L/W ratio of 1.5. Both micropyle and oocyst residuum were absent, but a polar granule was present. Oocysts of Eimeria goldbergi sp. n. were ellipsoidal, with a bilayered wall, and measured 21.4 x 16.1 microm; L/W ratio was 1.3. Both micropyle and oocyst residuum were absent, but a single or fragmented polar granule was present. Oocysts of Eimeria boulengeri sp. n. were spheroidal to slightly subspheroidal, with a thin, single-layered wall that readily collapses, and measured 16.0 microm, L/W ratio was 1.0. Both micropyle and oocyst residuum were absent, but usually one (sometimes two) polar granule(s) were present. Oocysts of Eimeria niuginiensis sp. n. were oblong to tapered with a bilayered wall, and measured 20.0 x 13.1 microm; L/W ratio was 1.5. A micropyle, oocyst residuum and polar granule were absent. To our knowledge, these represent the only coccidians ever described from P. stanleyanus.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25065124","annotations":[{"name":"Papua New Guinea","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"New Guinea","weight":0.649337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea"},{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.380556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Skink","weight":0.281463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skink"},{"name":"Eimeria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eimeria"},{"name":"Micropyle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropyle"},{"name":"Apicomplexa","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa"},{"name":"Coccidia","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidia"},{"name":"Harbor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor"},{"name":"Papua (province)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_(province)"},{"name":"Sphere","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Ellipsoid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Sauria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauria"},{"name":"Polar region","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_region"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Cone (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_(geometry)"},{"name":"Urban areas in Sweden","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_areas_in_Sweden"},{"name":"T-norm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-norm"},{"name":"Richard Owen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen"},{"name":"Guinea","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea"},{"name":"Rectangle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle"},{"name":"Owen Stanley","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Stanley"},{"name":"Speciation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"Apicomplexa lifecycle stages","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa_lifecycle_stages"}]}
