{"id":7381,"title":"Cholinergic nerve fibers in bone defects of a rat osteoporosis model and their regulation by implantation of bone substitution materials.","abstract":"Bone is innervated by autonomic nervous system that consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves that were recently identified in bone. Thus we asked whether parasympathetic nerves occur in bone defects and at the interface of substitution materials that were implanted for stabilization and improvement of healing in an osteoporosis animal model.Osteoporosis was induced in rats by ovariectomy and deficiency diet. A wedge-shaped osteotomy was performed in the metaphyseal area of femur. Eight different implants were inserted that were based on calcium phosphate cement, iron, silica-mineralized collagen, and modifications with strontium. Nerves were identified by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) as neuronal marker.Cholinergic nerves identified with VAChT immunostaining were detected in defects filled with granulation tissue and in surrounding mast cells. No immunolabeling of cholinergic nerves was found after implantation. The general presence of nerves was reduced after implantation as shown by PGP 9.5. Sympathetic nerves identified by TH immunolabeling were increased in strontium functionalized materials.Since cholinergic innervation was diminished after implantation a further increase in the compatibility of substitution materials to nerves could improve defect healing especially in osteoporotic bone.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Animal
