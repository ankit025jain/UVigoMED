{"id":61212,"title":"[Coagulation profiles during cardiac surgery].","abstract":"To evaluate patients' hemostasis after cardiac surgery using thromboelastometric and impedance aggregometry.66 patients were examined intraoperatively. Comparison group included 45 blood donors. Hemostasis was tested for thromboelastometricRotem Gamma with the assessment of external (exTem) and internal (inTem) pathways of coagulation tests performed detection of heparin (hepTem) and cytochalasin-D-inactivation of platelets (fibTem) to assess the level of fibrinogen. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was determined in an aggregometer CHRONO-LOG (USA).Significant deviations of the parameters of hemostasis were detected in 52 of the 66 studied patients. In group-1 (23 patients) revealed a residual effect of heparin. The effect manifested prolongation CT (clotting time) inTem to an average of 241 +/- 15 s, compared with CT hepTem--181 +/- 7. Patients in this group were in need of additional administration of protamine sulfate. Postoperative bleeding and resternotomia were observed in 3 patients of group-1. In group-2 (25 patients) CT inTem was 216 +/- 21 with significantly fewer CT hepTem (272 +/- 26). The data indicated excess of protamine sulfate. Platelets aggregation decreased compared to the norm. According to the obtained results, the addition of protamine sulfate is not required, however, in 7 cases the protamine sulfate was administered in a dose of 8.9 +/- 0.8 mg in 6 cases resternotomiya required. In the third group (n = 6) bleeding was observed in 4 patients. The difference in CT-hepCT was significant. Significant variations were revealed in the tests of the activity of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and cytochalasin-D-induced inactivation of platelets: exMCF- 42 +/- 2 mm (normal 57 +/- 15 mm), fibMCF 5.0 +/- 0.3 mm (norm 12.8 +/- 4.3 mm). The concentration of platelets and their aggregation activity was sharply reduced. Disorders of hemostasis in the third group, designated as dilution coagulopathy.Turning thromboelastometric and impedance aggregometry in the study of the coagulation profile of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in postperfusion period brings valuable information and allows a differentiated treatment of hemostasis disorders.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749302","annotations":[{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Coagulopathy","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.847427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.840946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.786427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.765606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Platelet aggregation","weight":0.436801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_aggregation"},{"name":"Protamine","weight":0.406403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protamine"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.380409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.313345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.228658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.113149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Protamine sulfate","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protamine_sulfate"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
