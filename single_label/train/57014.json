{"id":57014,"title":"Fertility preservation for age-related fertility decline.","abstract":"Cryopreservation of eggs or ovarian tissue to preserve fertility for patients with cancer has been studied since 1994 with R G Gosden's paper describing restoration of fertility in oophorectomised sheep, and for decades previously by others in smaller mammals. Clinically this approach has shown great success. Many healthy children have been born from eggs cryopreserved with the Kuwayama egg vitrification technique for non-medical (social) indications, but until now very few patients with cancer have achieved pregnancy with cryopreserved eggs. Often, oncologists do not wish to delay cancer treatment while the patient goes through multiple ovarian stimulation cycles to retrieve eggs, and the patient can only start using the oocytes after full recovery from cancer. Ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval is not a barrier for patients without cancer who wish to delay childbearing, which makes oocyte cryopreservation increasingly popular to overcome an age-related decline in fertility. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is an option if egg cryopreservation is ruled out. More than 35 babies have been born so far with cryopreserved ovarian tissue in patients with cancer who have had a complete return of hormonal function, and fertility to baseline. Both egg and ovarian tissue cryopreservation might be ready for application to the preservation of fertility not only in patients with cancer but also in countering the increasing incidence of age-related decline in female fertility.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25283572","annotations":[{"name":"Oocyte","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte"},{"name":"Cryopreservation","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Oocyte cryopreservation","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte_cryopreservation"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Mammal","weight":0.626259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Transvaginal oocyte retrieval","weight":0.497705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaginal_oocyte_retrieval"},{"name":"Fertility preservation","weight":0.495604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_preservation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.458458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.424509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Sheep","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
