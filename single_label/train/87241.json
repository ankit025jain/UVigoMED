{"id":87241,"title":"[Morphological characteristics of reparative osteogenesis under the conditions of transosseous osteosynthesis and intramedullary introduction of hydroxyapatite-coated wires].","abstract":"In the experiments performed on 16 dogs, an open comminuted tibial fracture was modeled, then wires with hydroxyapatite coating were inserted intramedullary, and osteosynthesis was performed using the Ilizarov fixator. Bone regenerates were studied 14-360 days after the surgery using the methods of light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray electron probe microanalysis. It was found that a zone of active reparative osteo- and angiogenesis was formed around the wires, as well as a bone sheath with the properties of osteogenesis conductor and inductor. Fracture consolidation occured early according to the primary type without cartilaginous and connective tissue formation in bone adhesion.","date":"2015-01-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552088","annotations":[{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.88694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Hydroxylapatite","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.825543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.617126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.564969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.518382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.4915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.476225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.336834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Light microscopy","weight":0.267195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_microscopy"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.263867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.246428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Coating","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coating"},{"name":"Inductor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Ilizarov apparatus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilizarov_apparatus"},{"name":"Microanalysis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microanalysis"},{"name":"Robot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"}]}
