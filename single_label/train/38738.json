{"id":38738,"title":"Resuscitation of a neonate with medium chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase deficiency using extracorporeal life support.","abstract":"We report a neonate with medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) who had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was deployed, from which the baby was subsequently separated and discharged from hospital. This case was a rare neonatal presentation of MCAD and an uncommon indication for ECLS. We discuss the presentations of patients with MCAD and the use of ECLS for patients with possible inborn errors of metabolism and other unknown primary diagnoses.
