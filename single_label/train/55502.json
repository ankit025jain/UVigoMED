{"id":55502,"title":"Intracranial idiopathic hypertension: 1-year follow-up study.","abstract":"Standard guidelines for ongoing management, as well as definitive data about the long-term course of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are not available. The aim of this study was to compare several clinical and instrumental variables as assessed at the time of diagnosis and then after 1 year in a sample of IIH patients. A total of 21 patients were studied. Our results confirmed that headache and TVO are the most frequent symptoms in IIH patients, and that overweight is a very common feature. A trend towards a favorable outcome in patients followed for 1 year and treated by usual medical therapy was found: intracranial pressure was lower at follow-up; improvement of headache and transient visual obscurations, as well as of papilledema, was reported in most patients. On the other hand, neuroradiological findings (such as empty sella, perioptic subarachnoid space distension, narrowing of the transverse sinuses) were substantially stable at follow. These findings may be relevant for future research as far as understanding the role of different clinical and instrumental findings as diagnostic items as well as predictors of outcome in IIH.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867861","annotations":[{"name":"Papilledema","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilledema"},{"name":"Intracranial pressure","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_pressure"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension"},{"name":"Headache","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.67878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Subarachnoid space","weight":0.267117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarachnoid_space"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.15852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Neuroradiology","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroradiology"}]}
