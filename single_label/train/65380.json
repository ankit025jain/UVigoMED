{"id":65380,"title":"[Clinical significance of serum telomerase mRNA in patients with prostate cancer].","abstract":"To explore the clinical significance of detecting serum mRNA of telomerase in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.Serum samples were collected from 29 patients with prostate cancer and 29 age-matched patients with cardiovascular or metabolic disease as non-tumor controls. Sera samples from 15 healthy age-matched subjects were used as healthy control. Detection of serum telomerase mRNA was performed with real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Serum telomerase mRNA was detectable in 89.7% (26/29) patients with prostate cancer, but almost undetectable in non-tumor (6.9%, 2/29) and healthy control groups(1/14).Using real-time PCR for detecting serum telomerase mRNA may be an auxiliary method for diagnosing and monitoring of prostate cancer.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851885","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Reverse transcriptase","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase"},{"name":"Telomerase","weight":0.830425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.589911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Inborn error of metabolism","weight":0.546683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inborn_error_of_metabolism"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.488739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.483887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.36118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.208234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0621105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
