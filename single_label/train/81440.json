{"id":81440,"title":"Restoring host-microbe homeostasis via selective chemoattraction of Tregs.","abstract":"The disruption of host-microbe homeostasis at the site of periodontal disease is considered a key factor for disease initiation and progress. While the downstream mechanisms responsible for the tissue damage per se are relatively well-known (involving various patterns of immune response operating toward periodontal tissue destruction), we are only beginning to understand the complexity of host-microbe interactions in the periodontal environment. Unfortunately, most of the research has been focused on the disruption of host-microbe homeostasis instead of focusing on the factors responsible for maintaining homeostasis. In this context, regulatory T-cells (Tregs) comprise a CD4+FOXp3 +T-cell subset with a unique ability to regulate other leukocyte functions to avoid excessive immune activation and its pathological consequences. Tregs act as critical determinants of host-microbe homeostasis, as well as determinants of a balanced host response after the disruption of host-microbe homeostasis by pathogens. In periodontitis, Tregs play a protective role, with their natural recruitment being responsible for conversion of active into inactive lesions. With controlled-release technology, it is now possible to achieve a selective chemoattraction of Tregs to periodontal tissues, attenuating experimental periodontitis evolution due to the local control of inflammatory immune response and the generation of a pro-reparative environment.
