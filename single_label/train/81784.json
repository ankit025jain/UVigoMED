{"id":81784,"title":"Alternative pharmacologic therapy for aggressive central giant cell granuloma: denosumab.","abstract":"In the search for new pharmacologic therapies for central giant cell granuloma (CGCG), proteins that are essential to osteoclastogenesis are intriguing potential targets. In the present case report, we describe a 25-year-old patient with an aggressive CGCG of the maxilla, who was successfully treated with the antiresorptive agent denosumab, after other pharmacologic treatment had failed to achieve regression or stabilization of the tumor. Denosumab could be a promising alternative to potentially mutilating surgery for CGCG. However, more research is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn about the potential role of this agent in the treatment of CGCG.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24835517","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.615997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.316731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Denosumab","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denosumab"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Self-harm","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Giant star","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Giant cell","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_cell"}]}
