{"id":4982,"title":"[Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for medial meniscal tear in late middle-aged adults].","abstract":"To study the results of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for medial meniscal tear in late middle-aged adults.From October 2010 to October 2012,49 patients meeting inclusion criteria were treated with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for medial meniscal tear. There were 31 males and 18 females,with an average age of (55.3±2.8) years old. There were 22 left knees and 27 right knees. The average flexion angle was (116.01±12.03)°. The pre-operative HSS Knee Score was 48.73±8.43, and the Lysholm score was 63.95±5.45. The patients were followed up and evaluated. All the patients received a standard surgery, in which the torn tissue was removed, and the anterior part of the meniscus was left in situ.All the surgeries were successful with no serious complications. All the patients were followed up,and the duration ranged from 12 to 36 months. All the patients had 5 degrees of muscle strength. The average flexion angle was (136.77±18.56)°. There was significant difference between the two angles before operation and after operation. The pre-operative HSS Knee Score was 90.17±4.10, and the Lysholm score was 87.84±5.16. Statistically, the difference between preoperative score and the postoperative score was significant.Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is a good option for medial meniscal tear in late middle-aged adults. Operative indication is crucial and the excellent surgical technique is also critical for the good clinical outcome. All the patients could get good clinical results, although there are some patients with motion restrictions in the early stage after operation.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464584","annotations":[{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.562366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.381281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.248449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.209985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Meniscus (anatomy)","weight":0.0411906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"845","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/845"},{"name":"738","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/738"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"2010 Winter Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Croatian Peasant Party","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Peasant_Party"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Twin-screw type supercharger","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-screw_type_supercharger"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Uncial 083","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_083"}]}
