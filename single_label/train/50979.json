{"id":50979,"title":"Sex differences in trends of incidence and mortality of first-ever stroke in rural Tianjin, China, from 1992 to 2012.","abstract":"Sex differences in secular trends of stroke incidence are rarely reported. We aimed to explore sex differences in incidence and mortality of stroke in rural China from 1992 to 2012.In 1992, 14 920 residents were recruited to participate in the Tianjin Brain Study, a population-based study on stroke surveillance. Stroke events and all deaths were annually registered.We observed 908 incident strokes (366 in women) from 1992 to 2012. Women were significantly younger than men (64±12 versus 68±11 years) in 1992 to 1998 (P=0.024). The incidence of first-ever stroke per 100 000 person-years for men was 166 in 1992 to 1998, 227 in 1999 to 2005, and 376 in 2006 to 2012; for women, the rates were 86 (1992-1998), 148 (1999-2005), and 264 (2006-2012). From 1992 to 2012, the incidence grew annually by 5.8% in men and 8.0% in women. The male/female incidence ratio declined significantly: 1.9 in 1992 to 1998, 1.5 in 1999 to 2005, and 1.4 in 2006 to 2012. There were no significant sex differences in mortality. The prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus, the levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, and the age of menopause and reproductive years in women concurrently increased in 2011.There was a significant increase in the incidence of first-ever stroke in women annually and a declining trend in the male/female rate ratio in rural China during the past 21 years. These results suggest that stroke will become one of the major diseases affecting women in future decades in China.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736241","annotations":[{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.72699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.708181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"China","weight":0.656035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.639651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.506798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.490766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Secularity","weight":0.441109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularity"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.250695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.122974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Tianjin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin"},{"name":"1999","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"1992","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"264","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/264"},{"name":"908","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/908"},{"name":"920","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/920"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"227 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/227_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"2012 (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_(film)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"Rural society in China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_society_in_China"}]}
