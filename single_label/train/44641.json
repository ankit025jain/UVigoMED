{"id":44641,"title":"Milk protein-based infant formula containing rice starch and low lactose reduces common regurgitation in healthy term infants: a randomized, blinded, and prospective trial.","abstract":"Spit-up (regurgitation) reduction with prethickened milk protein-based infant formulas containing rice starch has been clinically demonstrated in infants with heavy spit-ups but not in otherwise healthy normal infants with common spit-ups. The objective of this study was to evaluate growth, gastrointestinal tolerance, and efficacy to reduce common spit-up in normal, healthy term infants fed an investigational rice starch prethickened lactose-free milk protein-based infant formula.This double-blind, randomized, parallel study evaluated the investigational rice starch prethickened lactose-free (low lactose < 100 mg/L) milk protein-based infant formula compared to a standard, commercially available, iso-nutrient, lactose-containing (100% of carbohydrate) milk-based infant formula (control) for growth and gastrointestinal tolerance in healthy term infants (n = 132/group) fed from 14 Â± 3 days to 112 days of age. Data were classified and analyzed as evaluable (EV; subjects completing study per protocol) or intent-to-treat data (ITT; all subjects with available data).Growth as indicated by weight gain (primary variable) and formula intake were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between feeding groups (EV or ITT). Though both formulas were well tolerated, spit-up frequency was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the rice versus control group by 53% at 28 days of age, 54% at 56 days, 48% at 84 days, and 32% at 112 days (EV). Importantly, infants in the rice group were 1.6 to 1.8 times more likely to report zero spit-up than infants in the control group. The rice group also had higher percentages of soft and yellow stools.The rice starch prethickened lactose-free milk protein-based formula (rice) supported normal growth and safe use as the sole source of feeding for normal infants over the first 4 months of life. The rice formula was efficacious in providing a clinically relevant reduction of spit-up frequency in otherwise healthy term infants.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724771","annotations":[{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.748794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.69551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Starch","weight":0.668553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.549112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.523583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.515049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Lactose","weight":0.318828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.250019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Infant formula","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.114801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Rice","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.0506369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Yellow","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Parallel (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry)"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Individual time trial","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_time_trial"}]}
