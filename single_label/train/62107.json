{"id":62107,"title":"MYD88-independent growth and survival effects of Sp1 transactivation in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.","abstract":"Sp1 transcription factor controls a pleiotropic group of genes and its aberrant activation has been reported in a number of malignancies, including multiple myeloma. In this study, we investigate and report its aberrant activation in Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia (WM). Both loss of and gain of Sp1 function studies have highlighted a potential oncogenic role of Sp1 in WM. We have further investigated the effect of a small molecule inhibitor, terameprocol (TMP), targeting Sp1 activity in WM. Treatment with TMP inhibited the growth and survival and impaired nuclear factor-?B and signal transducer and activator of transcription activity in WM cells. We next investigated and observed that TMP treatment induced further inhibition of WM cells in MYD88 knockdown WM cells. Moreover, we observed that Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a downstream target of MYD88 signaling pathway, is transcriptionally regulated by Sp1 in WM cells. The combined use of TMP with Bruton's tyrosine kinase or interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and 4 inhibitors resulted in a significant and synergistic dose-dependent antiproliferative effect in MYD88-L265P-expressing WM cells. In summary, these results demonstrate Sp1 as an important transcription factor that regulates proliferation and survival of WM cells independent of MYD88 pathway activation, and provide preclinical rationale for clinical development of TMP in WM alone or in combination with inhibitors of MYD88 pathway.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24622324","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Pleiotropy","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.839472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Small molecule","weight":0.79742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_molecule"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Myd88","weight":0.707117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myd88"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.672482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.644453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.632073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.627743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Transactivation","weight":0.613286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactivation"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.597823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.372072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.350172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Sp1 transcription factor","weight":0.288198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp1_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.271842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Activator (genetics)","weight":0.0857289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Transducer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transducer"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Macroglobulinemia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroglobulinemia"},{"name":"Working memory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
