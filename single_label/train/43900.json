{"id":43900,"title":"Testosterone changes in patients with liver cirrhosis before and after orthotopic liver transplantation and its correlation with MELD.","abstract":"Hypogonadism is a common clinical situation in male patients with liver cirrhosis.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of orthotopic liver transplantation on testosterone, free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin in male with advanced liver disease and also to determine the relationship of these changes with Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score.In a prospective study, serum levels of testosterone, free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin of 30 male adult patients with end-stage liver disease were measured 2 to 4 hours before and 6 months after orthotopic liver transplantation.Total testosterone levels increased after orthotopic liver transplantation and the number of patients with normal testosterone levels increased from 18 to 24. Free testosterone mean level in the pre-transplant group was 7.8 pg/mL and increased to 11.5 pg/mL (P = 0.10) and sex hormone-binding globulin level decreased after orthotopic liver transplantation returning to normal levels in MELD ? 18 - group (A) (P<0.05).Serum level changes of testosterone, free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin are more pronounced in cirrhotic males with MELD ? 18. Serum levels of testosterone and free testosterone increase and serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin decrease after orthotopic liver transplantation.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760066","annotations":[{"name":"Hypogonadism","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadism"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.835475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.829772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.28755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.219821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0439018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
