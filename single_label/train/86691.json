{"id":86691,"title":"Extraneural metastasis of an ependymoma: a rare occurrence.","abstract":"Extraneural metastases of ependymoma are very rare, and have been reported in the lungs, lymph nodes, pleura, mediastinum, liver, diaphragmatic muscle, and bone. We describe the radiological findings of pathologically proven lung metastases from an anaplastic ependymoma. The tumor which arose in the posterior fossa was first diagnosed in 2007 when first surgical resection was performed outside our institute. Multiple operations were performed after that due to tumor relapse. Multiple lung nodules were discovered incidentally during a VP shunt survey. Biopsy from the lung nodules displayed identical histomorphology to the primary brain tumor.
