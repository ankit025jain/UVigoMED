{"id":33748,"title":"Patient-specific instruments for surgical resection of painful tarsal coalition in adolescents.","abstract":"Congenital tarsal coalition resection in adolescents may be hindered by the complex three-dimensional anatomy of the talocalcaneal joint. Peroperative fluoroscopy is not greatly contributive, especially for talocalcaneal coalition.3D planning and patient-specific instruments facilitate the procedure.A made-to-measure surgical guide (patient-specific instrument) was used in 9 consecutive patients for tarsal coalition resection (7 talocalcaneal and 2 calcaneonavicular coalitions). The guide was created by 3D modeling from the CT scan of the foot. Placed on the bone surface, it oriented the saw blade to resect the bone bridge at the appropriate depth. A fascia lata allograft was interposed. Complete resection and absence of recurrence were checked on postoperative CT in talocalcaneal and on radiography in calcaneonavicular coalitions.Resection was complete in all cases, with no recurrence at last follow-up.This technique makes tarsal coalition resection easier and more reliable and may be recommended to improve precision.Level IV, prospective study of a new surgical technique.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793905","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.758002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.640718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.59708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.581855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.499321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.418716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.283889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.22095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Saw","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Fascia lata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia_lata"},{"name":"3D modeling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Coalition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition"},{"name":"Blade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Subtalar joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtalar_joint"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Tarsus (skeleton)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Meat on the bone","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_on_the_bone"}]}
