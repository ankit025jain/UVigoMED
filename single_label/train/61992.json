{"id":61992,"title":"Therapeutic strategy for granulomatous lobular mastitis: a clinicopathological study of 12 patients.","abstract":"Granulomatous lobular mastitis (GLM) is a rare inflammatory pseudotumor. No therapeutic modality for this disease has been established because of its rarity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the treatment strategies of GLM. Twelve women who met the histological criteria for GLM were retrospectively studied. The clinical data and the presentation, histopathology, and management of the disease were analyzed by reviewing the patients' medical records. The diagnosis of GLM was confirmed histologically by core needle biopsy in 9 cases, by vacuum-assisted biopsy in 2 cases, and by excisional biopsy in 1 case. Ten patients received corticosteroid treatment and another two patients were treated with local excision or incision and drainage. The median initial dosage of corticosteroid (Prednisolone) was 30 mg/day (range: 15-60 mg/day), and the dosages were tapered according to improvement. The median duration of corticosteroid treatment was 5 months (range: 1-12 months). The median follow-up period was 22 months (range: 6-104 months), and no patient treated with corticosteroid demonstrated recurrence. However, patients treated with excision or incision and drainage had recurrences. These results suggest that steroid treatment may be the first choice in treatment strategies for GLM.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640175","annotations":[{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.908125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.792856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.725586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.509266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.46709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.434501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.427706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.326857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mastitis","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis"},{"name":"Granuloma","weight":0.218129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granuloma"},{"name":"Incision and drainage","weight":0.190903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incision_and_drainage"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.176201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.155123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Hypodermic needle","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0245813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"1560","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1560"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Optical fiber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber"},{"name":"Tapering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapering"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"}]}
