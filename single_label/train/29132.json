{"id":29132,"title":"Possible effects of metallosis on spermatozoal apoptotic genes expression in individuals with intramedullary nailing prosthesis.","abstract":"Seminal quality could be affected by metallosis caused by intramedullary nailing (IMN). Our objectives were to estimate metal ion levels in the seminal plasma of subjects with IMN, to determine their effects on semen parameters and on spermatozoal apoptotic gene expression, and to determine whether these expressed genes could be used as candidate biomarkers of seminal deterioration in individuals with IMN or not. Semen samples were collected from 60 subjects with IMN and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Seminal plasma contents of cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), and molybdenum (Mo) were assayed. Spermatozoal Bcl-2 and Bax gene expressions were determined. Studied semen parameters were significantly lower in subjects with IMN for ?5 years in relation to controls while the concentrations of Co, Cr, and Mo in the seminal plasma samples were significantly higher. There were significantly lower spermatozoal Bcl-2 expression, higher Bax expression, and lower Bcl-2/Bax ratio in subjects with IMN for ?5 years than in controls. In subjects with IMN for ?5 years, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of studied gene expressions and Bcl-2/Bax ratio were done showing priority of the ratio with 86.7 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity, 100 % positive predictive value, and 93.8 % negative predictive value at cutoff values ?0.777. Co, Cr, and Mo metals are found at high concentrations in the seminal plasma of individuals with IMN leading to increased spermatozoal apoptotic activity. Spermatozoal Bcl-2/Bax ratio could be used as a candidate biomarker of reproductive disorders in individuals with intramedullary nailing.
