{"id":42599,"title":"Evaluation of the frequency and pattern of local recurrence following intersphincteric resection for ultra-low rectal cancer.","abstract":"Abdomino-perineal resection has been the standard treatment for rectal tumors located ?5cm from the anal verge. Recently, intersphincteric resection became a valid option which preserves the bowel continuity with better functional outcome.Is to evaluate the oncological and functional outcome alongside the associated surgical morbidity in patients with T1-3 rectal cancer, who underwent intersphincteric resection (ISR).Between the years 2006 and 2011, 55 patients with invasive rectal adenocarcinoma, T1-3 lesions, located 2-5cm from the anal verge underwent ISR with total mesorectal excision. When inevitable, complete. ISR was performed, otherwise partial ISR was done. All T3 patients underwent total meso-rectal excision (TME) while some had lateral lymph node dissection (LND) with concomitant pelvic autonomic nerve preservation (PANP).Among the 55 patients, 21 (38.1%) patients were T1-2 and 34 (61.9%) patients were T3. The tumor location range was 0-5cm from the anal verge (median 2.3cm). Partial or complete ISR was done for 35 (63.6%) and 20 (36.4%), respectively. Patients were followed for a median of 1.5 years (range 1-4.6 years). The 3 year local recurrence and distant metastasis free rates were 85.2% and 85.6%, respectively. All the 3 local recurrences occurred in T3 patients group, and had positive circumferential resection margins. Overall 3-year disease-free survival was 82.6%; while the overall 3-year survival was 88.7%.Intersphincteric resection with TME does not affect the local recurrence or overall survival rate in early rectal cancer T1-2 & 3, with preservation of bowel continuity and better life quality.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841159","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.808844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.787823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.685797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Total mesorectal excision","weight":0.354541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_mesorectal_excision"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.346043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.326466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Autonomic nervous system","weight":0.268031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}]}
