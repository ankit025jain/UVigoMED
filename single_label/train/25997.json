{"id":25997,"title":"Hydrogen-containing saline attenuates doxorubicin-induced heart failure in rats.","abstract":"Interactions between doxorubicin (DOX) and iron generate reactive oxygen species and contribute to DOX-induced heart failure. Hydrogen, as a selective antioxidant, is a promising potential therapeutic option for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Therefore, we investigated the preventive effects of hydrogen treatment on DOX-induced heart failure in rats. We found that cardiac function was significantly improved and that the plasma levels of oxidative-stress markers and myocardial autophagic activity were decreased in animals treated with hydrogen-containing saline. Therefore, we conclude that hydrogen-containing saline may have beneficial effects for doxorubicin-induced heart failure.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158576","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.819346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Hydrogen","weight":0.798185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.661847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.6204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.501941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.362149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.238329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.221984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.167811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.154008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Autophagy","weight":0.132977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"List of grape varieties","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_grape_varieties"}]}
