{"id":35844,"title":"ESHRE PGD Consortium data collection XII: cycles from January to December 2009 with pregnancy follow-up to October 2010.","abstract":"How do data in the 12th annual data collection (Data XII) of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) Consortium compare with the cumulative data for collections I-XI?Since the beginning of the data collections, there has been a steady increase in the number of cycles, pregnancies and babies reported annually.The PGD Consortium has collected, analysed and published 11 previous data sets since 1997.Data were collected from each participating centre using a pre-designed FileMaker Pro database (versions 5-10). Separate FileMaker Pro files were used for the cycles, pregnancies and baby records. The study documented cycles performed during the calendar year 2009 and follow-up of the pregnancies and babies born which resulted from these cycles (until October 2010).Data were submitted by 60 centres (full PGD Consortium members), and the blank files were distributed to each PGD Consortium member centre at the end of 2008. The submitted data were thoroughly analysed to identify incomplete data entries and corrections were requested from the participating centres. Records remaining with incomplete data were excluded from the calculations. Corrections, tables and calculations were made by expert co-authors.For data collection XII, 60 centres reported data for 6160 cycles with oocyte retrieval (OR), along with details of the follow-up on 1607 pregnancies and 1238 babies born. A total of 870 OR were reported for chromosomal abnormalities, 113 OR for sexing for X-linked diseases, 1597 OR for monogenic diseases, 3551 OR for preimplantation genetic screening and 29 OR for social sexing.These data cannot include every PGD cycle performed annually, and only indicate the trends in PGD worldwide.The annual data collections provide an extremely valuable resource for data mining and for following trends in PGD practice.None.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
