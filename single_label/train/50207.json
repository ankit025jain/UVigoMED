{"id":50207,"title":"Histological analysis of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone during dental movement in diabetic rats subjected to low-level laser therapy.","abstract":"The purpose of this research was to evaluate the histological changes of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone during dental movement in diabetic rats subjected to low level laser therapy (LLLT).The movement of the upper molar was performed in 60 male Wistar rats divided into four groups (n=15): CTR (control), DBT (diabetic), CTR/LT (irradiated control) and DBT/LT (irradiated diabetic). Diabetes was induced with alloxan (150 mg/kg, i.p.). LLLT was applied with GaAlAs laser at 780 nm (35 J/cm(2)). After 7, 13 and 19 days, the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone were histologically analyzed.The mean of osteoblasts (p<0.01) and blood vessels (p<0.05) were significantly decreased in DBT compared with CTR at 7 days, whereas the mean of osteoclasts was lower at 7 (p<0.001) and 13 days (p<0.05). In DBT/LT, only the mean of osteoclasts was lower than in CTR (p<0.05) at 7 days, but no difference was observed at 13 and 19 days (p>0.05). The collagenization of the periodontal ligament was impaired in DBT, whereas DBT/LLT showed density/disposition of the collagen fibers similar to those observed in CTR.LLLT improved the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone remodeling activity in diabetic rats during dental movement.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814932","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontal fiber","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_fiber"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Osteoclast","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoclast"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.711571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Osteoblast","weight":0.700688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.630926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.615836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.572399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.45968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.420556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.283264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"}]}
