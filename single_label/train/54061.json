{"id":54061,"title":"Micro-RNAs and ovarian cancer: the state of art and perspectives of clinical research.","abstract":"Dysregulation of microRNA (mi-RNA) expression plays a major role in the development and progression of most human malignancies. Members of the miR-200 family, miR-182, miR-214 and miR-221 are frequently up-regulated, whereas miR-100, let-7i, miR-199a, miR-125b, mir-145 and miR-335 are often down-regulated in ovarian cancer compared with normal ovarian tissue. Most mi-RNA signatures are overlapping in different tumor histotypes but some mi-RNAs seem to be histotype specific. For instance, the endometrioid type shares with the serous and clear cell types the up-regulation of miR-200 family members, but also presents over-expression of miR-21, miR-202 and miR-205. Clear cell carcinoma has a significantly higher expression of miR-30a and miR-30a*, whereas mucinous histotype has elevated levels of miR-192/194. In vitro and in vivo investigations have shown that several mi-RNAs can modulate the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to platinum and taxane, and clinical studies have suggested that mi-RNA profiling may predict the outcome of patients with this malignancy. Some mi-RNAs could be used as biomarkers to identify patients that might benefit from the addition of molecularly targeted agents (i.e. anti-angiogenic agents, MET inhibitors and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors) to standard chemotherapy. Moreover, mi-RNAs could represent potential targets for the development of novel therapies.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479883","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Taxane","weight":0.861929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxane"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Angiogenesis inhibitor","weight":0.729617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.712993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.651658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.57308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.379314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Poly ADP ribose polymerase","weight":0.236089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_ADP_ribose_polymerase"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell type","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_type"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Endometrioid tumor","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrioid_tumor"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"C-Met","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Met"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Art","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art"}]}
