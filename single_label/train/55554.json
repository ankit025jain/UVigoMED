{"id":55554,"title":"Glaucoma prescribing trends in England 2000 to 2012.","abstract":"In 2009, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidance on the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. The aim of the present study was to describe the impact this guidance had on glaucoma prescribing and to describe recent prescribing trends in England.Prescribing cost analysis data held by NHS Business Authority for the years 2000-2012 was analysed.The number of prescriptions dispensed increased by 67% from 4.76 million in 2000 to 7.96 million in 2012. Over the same time period, drug costs increased by 88% from £55.2 million to £103.7 million. Prescriptions for prostaglandin analogues increased fourfold, while there was a threefold decrease in the use of beta-blockers. The most commonly prescribed glaucoma medication was latanoprost. The introduction of generic latanoprost in 2012 more than halved the cost associated with this medication. NICE guidance appeared to have had no effect on the total number of prescriptions or the classes of medications prescribed.The introduction of the NICE guidelines did not change glaucoma prescribing practice, although it is not clear whether this represents non-adherence to the guidelines or whether the guidelines embodied pre-existing practice.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24858531","annotations":[{"name":"National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence"},{"name":"Prostaglandin","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.840325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Generic drug","weight":0.72966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.289447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"England","weight":0.287592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"},{"name":"Latanoprost","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latanoprost"},{"name":"Ocular hypertension","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_hypertension"},{"name":"Business","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Total cost of ownership","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"}]}
