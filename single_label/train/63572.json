{"id":63572,"title":"[Hypereosinophilic syndrome initially presenting pulmonary embolism: a case report and review of the literature].","abstract":"To analyze clinical features of hypereosinophilic syndrome with multiple thrombosis and improve the understanding of eosinophilia resulting in thrombotic diseases.\" Eosinophils increased, thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis\", as the Chinese keywords, \"hypereosinophilic, thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis\", as the English keywords and to retrieve the literature from Wanfang database and Pubmed database January 2002- January 2012, a total of 17 articles, 5 Chinese articles, 4 in English, exclude those 2 articles which do not clearly diagnosis, a total of 7 articles were included, reports 8 cases, including 5 male, 3 female, age ranged from 24 to 75, combine the characteristics of the cases which reported in these literatures and our case, to make a literature review.A male, 27 years old complains shortness of breath, chest pain and blood in the sputum, pulmonary embolism diagnosed by chest enhanced CT, while deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed, laboratory examinations showed that blood eosinophils and thrombocytopenia. According to the literature that eosinophils can damage the vascular endothelial cells, leading to multiple arterial and venous thrombosis, anticoagulation while glucocorticoid treatment is effective.As one of eosinophilia, hypereosinophilic syndrome can involve multiple organs and cause multiple thrombosis. Anticoagulation and corticosteroids can reduce eosinophil count and decrease its toxins which can injure vascular endothelial.","date":"2014-01-15","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423822","annotations":[{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.839472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Eosinophilia","weight":0.786661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilia"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.765803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.75769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.689941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.689375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Breathing","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.593264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.562436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Hypereosinophilic syndrome","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypereosinophilic_syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.290881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Deep vein","weight":0.263763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.174002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.165593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0239641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}]}
