{"id":50538,"title":"Impact of combination chemotherapy with itraconazole on survival of patients with refractory ovarian cancer.","abstract":"After progression during chemotherapy, persistent ovarian cancer rarely responds to cytotoxic agents. We evaluated the use of adjunctive itraconazole for treating refractory ovarian cancer.Medical records of patients with ovarian cancer were retrospectively reviewed to select those with a history of platinum and taxane administration, clinical progression within six months of the last platinum administration, continuation of chemotherapy after the first progression during chemotherapy.Among 55 patients, itraconazole in combination with chemotherapy was administered to 19 patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 103 days and 53 days for chemotherapy with and without itraconazole, respectively (p=0.014). The corresponding median overall survival was 642 days and 139 days, respectively (p=0.006). The hazard ratio for PFS was 0.24 (p=0.002) and for overall survival was 0.27 (p=0.006) for therapy with itraconazole.Adjunctive itraconazole is promising for patients with refractory ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778064","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.728461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Itraconazole","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itraconazole"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.390249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Taxane","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxane"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.255524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.246599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.208512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.0594293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"642","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/642"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Adjunct (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_(grammar)"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"History of cancer chemotherapy","weight":0.0166129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cancer_chemotherapy"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Continuation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
