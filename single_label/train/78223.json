{"id":78223,"title":"[Short-term efficacy of standardized medication offer chronic rhinosinusitis].","abstract":"To evaluate the efficacy of standardized medication for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.According to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines on chronic rhinosinusitis formulated in 2008, by means of prospective study, we studied 54 patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis treated with standardized medication including, a combination of local intranasaI corticosteroids, macrolides, mucus discharging agent and nasal irrigation treatment and followed up for 3 months. Visual analogue scale (VAS), sino nasal outcome test-20 Chinese version scales (SNOT-20 CV), Lund-Mackay CT and Lund-Kennedy endoscopy methods were employed to conduct the subjective and objective assessment and comprehensively evaluate the clinical efficacy before and after treatment.(1) After three months of standardized medication, the patients' total scores of VAS, SNOT-20 CV, CT and endoscopy were improved significantly compared with those before-treatment (P < 0.01 for all these scoring systems). (2) There was statistically significant difference between the clinical efficacies of chronic rhinosinusitis patients with and without nasal polyps groups (P < 0.01). After 3 months of standardized medication, the effective rates of the CRSwNP group evaluated by subjective assessment and CT evaluation were 66.7% and 94.4% respectively, while those of the CRSsNP groups were 91.7% and 97.2% respectively. (3) Betwecn CRSwNP and CRSsNP groups, there was no significant difference in the improvement rate or inefficiency rate in subjective assessment except for the cure rate, while there were significant differences in both cure rate and improvement rate in CT evaluation. (4) The CRS patients' self-testing-based questionnaires results showed positive correlation with objective assessments.The standardized medication with combination of intranasal local glucocorticoid, macrolides (14-membered ring), the mucus discharging agent and nasal irrigation on CRS was effective.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738305","annotations":[{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.693938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.620804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.581188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.27769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.268959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Sinusitis","weight":0.202918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusitis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.0981722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Nasal polyp","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp"},{"name":"Nasal irrigation","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_irrigation"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Macrolide","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Medical algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_algorithm"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.0148013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
