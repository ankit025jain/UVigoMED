{"id":16228,"title":"Serogrouping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of Listeria monocytogenes isolates from cases of human infection in Hungary 2004â€“2012 molecular typing of Listeria monocytogenes in Hungary.","abstract":"Eighty isolates of Listeria monocytogenes cultured from human infections in Hungary between 2004 and 2012 were serotyped by the PCR technique of Doumithet al. [9] and characterised by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Most of the isolates belonged to two serogroups: 53 isolates (66.3%) to serovar group 4b,4d,4e and 21isolates (25.8%) to serogroup 1/2a,3a. Although many pulsotypes were identified a particular pulsotype proved highly excelling comprising of 31 isolates after digestion by both ApaI and AscI restriction enzymes. All strains from this pulsotype belonged toserovar group 4b,4d,4e. Interestingly 24% of isolates from invasive samples(cerebrospinal fluid, blood) belonged to two distinct pulsotypes in the less common serovar group 1/2a,3a. Several small clusters of cases caused by isolates with identical pulsotypes were identified.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046881","annotations":[{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.8309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.744811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.676284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.67369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Listeria","weight":0.474975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"},{"name":"Pulsed field gel electrophoresis","weight":0.446041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_field_gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.441668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.313465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Listeria monocytogenes","weight":0.140403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Group 12 element","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_12_element"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Inflorescence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Typing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing"},{"name":"Primary isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_isolate"},{"name":"British Board of Film Classification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Board_of_Film_Classification"},{"name":"Penny (British pre-decimal coin)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(British_pre-decimal_coin)"},{"name":"Group 4 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_4_element"},{"name":"Actinomycosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinomycosis"}]}
