{"id":43899,"title":"Colonoscopy and carcinoembryonic antigen variations.","abstract":"Colonoscopy is essential for synchronous and metachronous cancer detection. Carcinoembryonic antigen is a colorectal cancer tumor marker, important as a follow-up tool in patients with previous colorectal cancer. False-positive carcinoembryonic antigen elevation results in multiples exams and in patient anxiety. In literature, there is reference to transient carcinoembryonic antigen increase with colonoscopy.To evaluate the influence of bowel preparation and colonoscopy in carcinoembryonic antigen blood levels.We prospectively studied subjects that underwent routine colonoscopy in our institution. Blood samples were collected (1) before bowel cleaning, (2) before colonoscopy and (3) immediately after colonoscopy. Blood carcinoembryonic antigen levels were determined by \"Sandwich\" immunoassay. The statistical methods used were the paired t-test and ANOVA.Thirty-seven patients (22M/15F) were included; age range 28-84 (mean 56 years). Mean carcinoembryonic antigen values were 1.9, 2 and 1.8 for (1), (2) and (3), respectively. An increase in value (2) compared with (1) was observed in 20/37 patients (P = 0.018), mainly in younger patients and in patients requiring more endoluminal interventions. In 29/37 patients, the CEA value decreased from (2) to (3) (P = 1.3x10-7).A trend for carcinoembryonic antigen increase after bowel cleaning was observed, especially in younger patients and in patients with more endoluminal interventions, but without clinical meaning.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760068","annotations":[{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.875525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.865242,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.702154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.697067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.520579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.461689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.417124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.318588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.256114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"2037","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2037"},{"name":"Match play","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_play"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashkirian_Airlines_Flight_2937"},{"name":"Colon cleansing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_cleansing"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Cleanliness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanliness"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"South African Class 15F 4-8-2","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Class_15F_4-8-2"}]}
