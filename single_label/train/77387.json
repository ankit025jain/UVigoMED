{"id":77387,"title":"[Oxidative stress and antioxidant therapy with alpha-lipoic acid inclusion in acute poisoning by herbicide based on 2,4-dichlorphenoxyacetic acid].","abstract":"In patients with acute poisoning amine salt herbicide 2,4-D develops oxidative stress with simultaneous inhibition of intracellular and extracellular antioxidant factors. These changes are more pronounced with neurological disorders that occur in conjunction with a toxic damage of liver or heart. The inclusion of a comprehensive detoxification therapy alpha-lipoic acid not only promotes a more pronounced therapeutic effect but also an earlier recourse cytolytic syndrome, a marked recovery of levels of malondialdehyde and indices of antioxidant system (superoxide dismutase and ceruloplasmin) than for patients in the comparison group.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908976","annotations":[{"name":"Herbicide","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbicide"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Poison","weight":0.847526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.696268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.691454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.632844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.603856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.584048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.570556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.539158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.509057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Detoxification","weight":0.378002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification"},{"name":"Ceruloplasmin","weight":0.357697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceruloplasmin"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.215327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.179746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Neurological disorder","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Purification Rundown","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purification_Rundown"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
