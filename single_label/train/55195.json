{"id":55195,"title":"[Telesensoric contact lenses -Â new possibilities in intraocular pressure diagnostics].","abstract":"Recently, on the European market, the contact lenses allowing for a 24-hour continuous measurement of intraocular pressure - Triggerfish, became available. They are designed for the diagnostics of glaucoma in adult patients. This is a unique method that allows for continuous recording of intraocular pressure, giving almost 300 readings during 24 hours.Aim of the project is to use this new diagnostic instrument in children and evaluate clinical usefulness of the new method in glaucoma diagnostics. It also seeks to familiarize readers with new diagnostic possibilities that telesensoric contact lenses provide.The \"Triggerfish\" silicone contact lenses were used in the study in order to perform a continuous, 24-hour measurement of the intraocular pressure. A diagnostic test kit consists of a contact lens with imbedded microchip with transceiver loop, adhesive antenna to affix around the patients eye and the recorder connected to the antenna by a cable. The measurements were performed in two patients at the age of 12 and 14.In both cases the graphs of 24-hour intraocular pressure recordings were obtained allowing for detection of the pathological features of the intraocular pressure. Patients reported no discomfort during the study. No adverse events were observed.Examination techniques using ocular telemetry sensors may be an alternative to conventional methods and throwing new light on the diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24967780","annotations":[{"name":"Contact lens","weight":0.905122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.54277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Antenna (radio)","weight":0.425681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)"},{"name":"Telemetry","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.299254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.211382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.0742264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Affix","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix"},{"name":"Transceiver","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transceiver"},{"name":"Triggerfish","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triggerfish"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"European Economic Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics"},{"name":"Aim (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_(musician)"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Cable","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
