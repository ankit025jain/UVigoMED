{"id":82327,"title":"A technique to salvage endodontically compromised maxillary anterior tooth.","abstract":"A complication of endodontic treatment is over-preparation of the tooth structure in an attempt to access calcified pulp chambers and root canals. This could result in thin root walls that might compromise the long-term prognosis of the tooth. There are various treatment options when such a complication occurs, among them, extraction of the compromised tooth and its replacement with a dental implant. This clinical report describes a nonsurgical, multidisciplinary treatment alternative where a maxillary anterior tooth with a thinned root wall was successfully saved by repairing the damaged root to its original thickness using a composite resin material and subsequently restoring with a cast post and core and a crown.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654367","annotations":[{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.789089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Endodontic therapy","weight":0.687646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontic_therapy"},{"name":"Dental composite","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_composite"},{"name":"Post and core","weight":0.595277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_and_core"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.58336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Endodontics","weight":0.520925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.357292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Crown (dentistry)","weight":0.323353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(dentistry)"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.29946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.266983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.163635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Casting","weight":0.0362205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Marine salvage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Interdisciplinarity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Compromise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bicameralism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism"}]}
