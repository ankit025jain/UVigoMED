{"id":42472,"title":"Section 12. Living donor liver transplantation for patients with high model for end-stage liver disease scores and acute liver failure.","abstract":"Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for patients with high model for end-stage liver disease score and acute liver failure patients have little or not gained any substantial following among Western centers because of the \"donor high risk-low recipient benefit scenario\" that puts the donor at a significant risk against the survival odds for a recipient who is receiving a partial graft and considered marginal by Western standards. In most Asian countries, there is sometimes no other source of live graft but a willing live liver donor. There are individual Asian center reports that conclude that LDLT has comparable outcome to deceased donor liver transplant. However, the outcomes of a large number of patients after undergoing adult LDLT for high model for end-stage liver disease scores and acute liver failure at a single center have not been investigated. Here in, we present our experience with such subgroup of patients undergoing LDLT.
