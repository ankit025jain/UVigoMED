{"id":77647,"title":"Low back and neck pain in locomotive engineers exposed to whole-body vibration.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and excess risk of low back pain and neck pain in locomotive engineers, and to investigate the relationship of both with whole-body vibration exposure. A cross-sectional survey comparing locomotive engineers with other rail worker referents was conducted. Current vibration levels were measured, cumulative exposures calculated for engineers and referents, and low back and neck pain assessed by a self-completed questionnaire. Median vibration exposure in the z- (vertical) axis was 0.62 m/s(2). Engineers experienced more frequent low back and neck pain, odds ratios (ORs) of 1.77 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-2.64) and 1.92 (95% CI: 1.22-3.02), respectively. The authors conclude that vibration close to the \"action levels\" of published standards contribute to low back and neck pain. Vibration levels need to be assessed conservatively and control measures introduced.","date":"2014-02-06","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24499248","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.469103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.339734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Oscillation","weight":0.212256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"},{"name":"Engineer","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer"},{"name":"Vibration","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Low back pain","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_back_pain"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"223","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/223"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Back pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Other Ranks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Ranks"},{"name":"Workforce","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce"},{"name":"Railroad engineer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_engineer"},{"name":"Human back","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_back"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Neck pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_pain"},{"name":"Rail transport","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Redshift","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Reference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference"},{"name":"Locomotive","weight":0.0113784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive"}]}
