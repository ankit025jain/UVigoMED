{"id":14578,"title":"Doppler echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in dogs: a retrospective clinical investigation.","abstract":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) decreases resistance to fatigue and life expectancy. The aim of this study was to correlate some indirect Doppler indices of PH with tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation criteria and to relate PH on different indices with the severity of clinical signs. Furthermore the pathogenetic mechanisms associated to PH development were discussed. Dogs with Doppler echocardiographic evidence of PH diagnosed by assessment of pulmonary and tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity were selected, their clinical records were reviewed and a clinical score was computed. Seventeen cases of PH were identified. The degree of PH was assessed based on systolic or diastolic pulmonary pressure and the indirect Doppler indices (AT/ET and Tei Index) were calculated; data were statistically evaluated. Indirect Doppler indices were calculated also in a control group of seven healthy dogs. The most common clinical signs were coughing, dyspnea and syncope; the most common condition associated to PH development was the left-sided valvular heart disease. A significant positive correlation was found between Tei Index and both the systolic pressure and the severity of PH while no correlations were found between PH on different indices and clinical score and/or severity of clinical signs. Results of this study suggest that Tei-index could be an useful support not only to reveal PH but also to give information on the severity of PH. The clinical picture in dogs with PH is apparently unpredictable and not strictly correlated with the severity of PH.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24414341","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary hypertension","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_hypertension"},{"name":"Dyspnea","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.86437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Valvular heart disease","weight":0.78751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valvular_heart_disease"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.714865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Tricuspid valve","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricuspid_valve"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.508347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.497072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.284057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.234633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.207909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.138385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.112059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Jet aircraft","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
