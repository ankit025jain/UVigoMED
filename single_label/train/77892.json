{"id":77892,"title":"ERP correlates of German Sign Language processing in deaf native signers.","abstract":"The present study investigated the neural correlates of sign language processing of Deaf people who had learned German Sign Language (Deutsche Geb√§rdensprache, DGS) from their Deaf parents as their first language. Correct and incorrect signed sentences were presented sign by sign on a computer screen. At the end of each sentence the participants had to judge whether or not the sentence was an appropriate DGS sentence. Two types of violations were introduced: (1) semantically incorrect sentences containing a selectional restriction violation (implausible object); (2) morphosyntactically incorrect sentences containing a verb that was incorrectly inflected (i.e., incorrect direction of movement). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 74 scalp electrodes.Semantic violations (implausible signs) elicited an N400 effect followed by a positivity. Sentences with a morphosyntactic violation (verb agreement violation) elicited a negativity followed by a broad centro-parietal positivity.ERP correlates of semantic and morphosyntactic aspects of DGS clearly differed from each other and showed a number of similarities with those observed in other signed and oral languages. These data suggest a similar functional organization of signed and oral languages despite the visual-spacial modality of sign language.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884527","annotations":[{"name":"Morphology (linguistics)","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.801283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"First language","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language"},{"name":"Inflection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection"},{"name":"Verb","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb"},{"name":"Semantics","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics"},{"name":"Sign language","weight":0.719463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.585035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.52858,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"German Sign Language","weight":0.517391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Sign_Language"},{"name":"Sentence (linguistics)","weight":0.491269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Language processing","weight":0.473327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_processing"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.459372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.356946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"German language","weight":0.297427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language"},{"name":"Event-related potential","weight":0.284993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-related_potential"},{"name":"N400 (neuroscience)","weight":0.282569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N400_(neuroscience)"},{"name":"Agreement (linguistics)","weight":0.214021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_(linguistics)"},{"name":"Object (grammar)","weight":0.162852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(grammar)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sign (semiotics)","weight":0.102187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)"},{"name":"Computer monitor","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Electrode","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrode"},{"name":"Sentences","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentences"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Judge","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Information processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing"},{"name":"Scalp","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp"},{"name":"Neural correlate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_correlate"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"New religious movement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_religious_movement"},{"name":"Modality (semiotics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modality_(semiotics)"}]}
