{"id":23241,"title":"Bacteria induce prolonged PMN survival via a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C- and protein kinase C-dependent mechanism.","abstract":"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are essential for the human innate immune defense, limiting expansion of invading microorganisms. PMN turnover is controlled by apoptosis, but the regulating signaling pathways remain elusive, largely due to inherent differences between mice and humans that undermine use of mouse models for understanding human PMN biology. Here, we aim to elucidate signal transduction mediating survival of human peripheral blood PMNs in response to bacteria, such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, an enteropathogen that causes the gastro-intestinal disease yersiniosis, as well as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Determinations of cell death reveal that uninfected control cells undergo apoptosis, while PMNs infected with either Gram-positive or -negative bacteria show profoundly increased survival. Infected cells exhibit decreased caspase 3 and 8 activities, increased mitochondrial integrity and are resistant to apoptosis induced by a death receptor ligand. This bacteria-induced response is accompanied by pro-inflammatory cytokine production including interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-? competent to attract additional PMNs. Using agonists and pharmacological inhibitors, we show participation of Toll-like receptor 2 and 4, and interestingly, that protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), but not tyrosine kinases or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) are key players in this dual PMN response. Our findings indicate the importance of prolonged PMN survival in response to bacteria, where general signaling pathways ensure complete exploitation of PMN anti-microbial capacity.
