{"id":35109,"title":"First metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis for the treatment of tophaceous gouty arthritis.","abstract":"In tophaceous gouty arthritis, surgeons face the choice between preservation of the involved joint and arthrodesis after tophi excision. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can allow evaluation of the distribution of tophaceous deposits, which can be difficult to visualize on radiography. The goal of this study was to evaluate the characteristic MRI features of tophaceous lesions and to compare the clinical outcomes of arthrodesis after tophi excision with those of simple tophi excision. The authors reviewed 16 feet in 15 consecutive patients diagnosed with tophaceous gouty arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint who underwent surgery. Nine feet (group A) were treated with simple tophi excision, whereas the other 7 (group B) underwent first MTP joint arthrodesis after tophi excision. For clinical evaluation, the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, Tegner activity scale, and patient satisfaction assessments were used. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate the characteristics of tophaceous deposits in the first MTP joint. Mean VAS and AOFAS scores and patient satisfaction significantly differed between the 2 groups at final follow-up (P=.007, .005, and .002, respectively). In group A, progression of arthritis of the first MTP joint was observed in 6 of 9 cases at final follow-up. The tophaceous lesions of these 6 cases were found to be located intra-articularly on MRI. Arthrodesis after tophi excision should be considered for treating tophaceous gouty arthritis of the first MTP joint when tophi are located intra-articularly and loss of cartilage involved is greater than 50% of the entire joint.
