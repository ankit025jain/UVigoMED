{"id":37664,"title":"Early complete repair of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collaterals.","abstract":"Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collaterals (PA/VSD/MAPCAs) is a complex and diverse form of congenital heart defect. Although most patients with PA/VSD/MAPCAs can wait until they are 3 to 6 months of age to undergo surgical reconstruction, there are three specific criteria that merit an earlier repair. These 3 criteria are (1) unremitting heart failure; (2) a ductus to one lung and MAPCAs to the other; and (3) hemitruncus to one lung and MAPCAs to the other. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our surgical experience with early complete repair of PA/VSD/MAPCAs.This was a retrospective review of patients undergoing complete repair of PA/VSD/MAPCAs within the first 60 days of life. Twenty-seven patients were identified in our database (2002 to 2013) who met these criteria. Fifteen had congestive heart failure, 9 had a ductus plus MAPCAs, and 3 had hemitruncus plus MAPCAs. The median age at surgery was 5 weeks.There was no operative mortality in this cohort of 27 patients. Hemodynamics at the conclusion of the complete repair demonstrated an average right ventricular peak systolic pressure of 32 ± 5 mm Hg and an average right ventricle to aortic pressure ratio of 0.36 ± 0.06. The median length of hospital stay was 26 days. There have been 2 subsequent mortalities (7%), with a median follow-up duration of 4 years. Eight of the 27 patients have subsequently undergone conduit replacements at our institution. The hemodynamics at the conclusion of the conduit change were statistically unchanged compared with the hemodynamics after complete repair.The data demonstrate that early complete repair of PA/VSD/MAPCAs can be accomplished with low mortality and excellent postoperative hemodynamics. These early hemodynamic results are maintained at medium-term follow-up. We conclude that early complete repair is an appropriate choice for this highly select subgroup of patients.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480261","annotations":[{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.84647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.790582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.705394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.572845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Atresia","weight":0.541726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atresia"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.509985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.449525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.2769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0337886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Pulmonary atresia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_atresia"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Collateral circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_circulation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
