{"id":74394,"title":"Effect of Sini San freeze-dried powder on sleep-waking cycle in insomnia rats.","abstract":"To investigate the effects of the Sini San at different doses on each sleeping state [slow-wave sleep 1 (SWS 1), slow-wave sleep 2 (SWS2), rapid-eye-movement (REM), wakefulness (W)] in insomnia rats and to identify its mode of action for improving sleep.The insomnia rats were randomly divided into a high-, medium- or low-dose group of Sini San (equal to crude drug 8.8, 4.4, or 2.2 g/kg, respectively) for seven consecutive days.Compared with pre-administration, SWS2 was significantly increased after administration of the low dose. Compared with pre-administration, W was significantly decreased and SWS1, SWS2, and the total sleeping time (TST) were markedly increased after administration of the medium dose. Compared with pre-administration, W was significantly decreased and SWS1, SWS2, rapid-eye-movement sleep, and TST were significantly longer after administration of the high dose. The effects of Sini San on sleep-wake cycle are dose-dependent.The results suggest that Sini San extends SWS1 and SWS2, which increases the total sleeping time.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417408","annotations":[{"name":"Insomnia","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.473334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.338934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Action film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"},{"name":"Slow-wave sleep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-wave_sleep"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Powder (substance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(substance)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Wakefulness","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefulness"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"}]}
