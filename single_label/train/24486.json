{"id":24486,"title":"Epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection among Iranian children.","abstract":"Infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP) either in children or in adults is a risk factor for gastric cancer. The Golestan province located in northeast Iran has been known to be a high-risk area for oesophageal and gastric cancers. This study was conducted to assess the epidemiology of this infection in the children of Golestan.This study was carried out in 2009 on healthy children (1-15years) of the Golestan province. Serum immunoglobulin G (Ig G) antibody against HP was tested in these children and positive samples were tested for anti-cytotoxin-associated antigen A (anti-CagA) antibody. To assess the relationship between HP infection and the risk of gastric cancer, the Golestan province was divided into high- and low-risk areas based on the incidence rate of gastric cancer. The chi-squared test was used to assess the relationship between variables.Totally, 194 subjects were recruited. The prevalence of HP infection in our area was 50.5%. The prevalence of HP infection was significantly higher in the high-risk than in the low-risk area for stomach cancer (p=0.004). The seropositivities of HP (p=0.03) and CagA (p=0.04) were significantly lower in children <5years than in others.Our results showed a high prevalence of HP infection in children of the Golestan province of Iran. We also found a significant positive relationship between childhood HP infection and the risk of gastric cancer. Hence, childhood HP infection may be considered a possible determinant of gastric cancer in this high-risk area. Implementation of preventive programmes may help to reduce the burden of childhood HP infection and, consequently, gastric cancer in this area.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433647","annotations":[{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Helicobacter pylori","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.6891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.688452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.506676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.32337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Helicobacter","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"Golestan province","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golestan_province"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Direct relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_relationship"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Hewlett-Packard","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Golestan","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golestan"}]}
