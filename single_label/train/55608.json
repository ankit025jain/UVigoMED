{"id":55608,"title":"Anti-VEGF therapy in myopic choroidal neovascularization: long-term results.","abstract":"To evaluate the medium- and long-term efficacy of anti-VEGF agents in the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia (mCNV).We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with mCNV who had been treated with intravitreous anti-VEGF for at least 2 years. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) were compared before and after the treatment. The number of injections per year was also assessed.The results were analysed at 2 years for 67 eyes, at 3 years for 52 eyes, at 4 years for 28 eyes and at 5 years for 13 eyes. The mean change from baseline BCVA was significant at 2 years (+8.6 letters; p < 0.001) and this gain remained significantly stable for a period of 5 years. The mean CRT showed a significant decrease over time, with a nadir at 2 years (-104.0 ?m; p < 0.001). The mean number of injections performed during the first year was 5.2, being lower in subsequent years (p < 0.001).In this subset of patients with mCNV, an intravitreous therapy with anti-VEGF agents proved to have effective results over 5 years, with a sustained increase in BCVA.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852069","annotations":[{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.724721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.281145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cathode ray tube","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.127918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Choroid","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroid"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Nadir","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Minuscule 104","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_104"},{"name":"Neovascularization","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization"}]}
