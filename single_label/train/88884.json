{"id":88884,"title":"Surgical dislocation of the hip for reduction of acetabular fracture and evaluation of chondral damage.","abstract":"To assess the outcome of open reduction and internal fixation combined with surgical dislocation of the hip for displaced acetabular fractures.20 men and 2 women aged 20 to 55 (mean, 28) years underwent open reduction and internal fixation combined with surgical dislocation of the hip for displaced acetabular fracture. The most common fracture pattern was bicolumnar (n=12), followed by transverse (n=6) and T-type (n=4). Femoral head chondral lesions were classified as grade 0 (no defect) to grade 4 (osteochondral defect). Fracture fragments were fixed with titanium plates and screws, and the femoral head was redislocated to inspect for intraarticular screws. The association between functional status and acetabular fracture pattern and femoral head chondral lesions was explored.Nine patients had chondral lesions in the femoral head (mostly in the anterosuperior zone), but none in the acetabulum. All femoral heads were viable. Reduction was anatomic in 6 patients and satisfactory in 16. Functional outcome was very good in 6 patients, good in 13, medium in 2, and fair in one. No patient developed avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Four patients had iatrogenic sciatic nerve palsy. One patient developed early degenerative hip arthritis and underwent total hip arthroplasty 14 months later.Surgical dislocation of the hip facilitated anatomic reduction and inspection of any chondral lesions. It did not result in avascular necrosis of the femoral head.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781607","annotations":[{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Hip replacement","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_replacement"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.773069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.685068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.627226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Sciatic nerve","weight":0.549916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_nerve"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.474758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.304746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.258737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Osteochondrosis","weight":0.0665899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondrosis"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Degenerative disease","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Child prodigy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
