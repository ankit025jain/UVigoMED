{"id":45731,"title":"Colon polyp model use for educating about colorectal cancer screening in the Iowa Research Network.","abstract":"Providing a model of a colon segment with an adenomatous polyp and cancer can help to educate patients about the adenoma to carcinoma sequence and how this sequence can be interrupted with appropriate testing. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of a three-dimensional colon model with polyps and cancer provided to family physicians or nurses in some Iowa Research Network family physician offices. Colon models were provided to 117 family medicine healthcare providers interested in colorectal cancer screening. Using a mailed survey and follow-up telephone calls to non-responders, 81 (69%) questionnaires were returned. Thirty-six (44%) of the respondents reported they had used the model, 33 (41%) reported they used the model for a mean 16% of their patients in a month's time, 31 (38%) reported using the model to teach patients about the colon and polyps prior to a colonoscopy. Other model use described by respondents included educating staff to promote patient willingness for colonoscopies, demonstrating the need for colon cancer screening, and teaching patients about annual fecal occult blood tests. Respondents agreed that anatomical models are helpful for patient education, the design of the colon model was good, and that it facilitated demonstration of colon polyps. Possible recommendations for an office-wide adoption of an anatomical model would be an in-service for all employees and a standard location for finding the model.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668406","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.857718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Polyp (medicine)","weight":0.854429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp_(medicine)"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.847721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Fecal occult blood","weight":0.717924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_occult_blood"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.630312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.57535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.51643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.482929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cancer screening","weight":0.302269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"},{"name":"Family medicine","weight":0.287592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_medicine"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.266993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.20029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Iowa","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Occult","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"}]}
