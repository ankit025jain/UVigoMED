{"id":66108,"title":"Role of metastasectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the era of targeted therapy.","abstract":"Numerous biological pathways are affected in renal cell carcinoma and the introduction of targeted agents has improved the survival of patients with advanced and metastatic disease. Durable and long-lasting cure is rarely achieved, and in select cases, the excision of metastatic deposits has shown to increase survival. Clinical trials of targeted agents are being explored as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies with the role of metastasectomy evolving in the treatment paradigm. This review examines published reports of metastasectomy and its developing role in the era of targeted therapy. A Medline search was conducted using keywords \"metastasectomy,\" \"renal cell carcinoma,\" and \"targeted therapy,\" and selected articles are discussed by examining prognostic stratification and metastasectomy in major anatomic regions. Most published reports span earlier periods of immunotherapy and chemotherapy, and henceforth, discussions are in historical context in this review. Although there is lack of Level 1 evidence, reports have suggested the prognostic value and survival benefit for metastasectomy in lesions that are amenable to complete resection after longer disease-free intervals in carefully selected patients with adequate performance status. Therefore, the role of metastasectomy must be further elucidated in the era of targeted therapy.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24744223","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.824245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.804468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.682831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.537337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.45775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.456885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.415743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.414997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Performance status","weight":0.231247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
