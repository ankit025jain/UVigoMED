{"id":68965,"title":"V-ATPase inhibition regulates anoikis resistance and metastasis of cancer cells.","abstract":"Fighting metastasis is a major challenge in cancer therapy and novel therapeutic targets and drugs are highly appreciated. Resistance of invasive cells to anoikis, a particular type of apoptosis induced by loss of cell-matrix contact, is a major prerequisite for their metastatic spread. Inducing anoikis in metastatic cancer cells is therefore a promising therapeutic approach. The vacuolar-ATPase (V-ATPase), a proton pump located at the membrane of acidic organelles, has recently come to focus as an antimetastatic cancer target. As V-ATPase inhibitors have shown to prevent invasion of tumor cells and are able to induce apoptosis, we proposed that V-ATPase inhibition induces anoikis-related pathways in invasive cancer cells. We used the V-ATPase inhibitor archazolid to investigate the mechanism of anoikis induction in various metastatic cancer cells (T24, MDA-MB-231, 4T1, 5637) in vitro. Anoikis induction by archazolid was characterized by decreased c-FLIP expression and caspase-8 activation as well as reduction of active integrin-?1 and an early increase of the proapoptotic protein BIM. However, we observed that archazolid also induces mechanisms opposing anoikis such as degradation of BIM mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt and Src kinases at later time points and induction of reactive oxygen species. Still, intravenous injection of archazolid-treated 4T1-Luc2 mouse breast cancer cells resulted in reduced metastasis in mouse lungs. Thus, V-ATPase inhibition is not only an interesting option to reduce cancer metastasis, but also to better understand anoikis resistance and to find choices to fight against it.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482380","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Proton","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.798635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.779432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.75702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Organelle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.701752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.693966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Proton pump","weight":0.660445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_pump"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.650183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.599962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.356173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.316423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.278108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.249672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Biological target","weight":0.237118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_target"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.159096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Chemical decomposition","weight":0.123702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_decomposition"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0940019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"}]}
