{"id":51997,"title":"Mental health problems among adolescents with early-onset and long-duration type 1 diabetes and their association with quality of life: a population-based survey.","abstract":"To evaluate mental health problems and associations between mental health problems and health-related quality of life in adolescents with type 1 diabetes in comparison with the general population.A total of 629 11- to 17-year-olds with early-onset and long-lasting type 1 diabetes and their parents completed comprehensive questionnaires. Mental health was assessed using the parent- and self-report versions of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The Revised Children's Quality of Life Questionnaire (KINDL-R) was used to measure quality of life. The comparison group (n?=?6,813) was a representative sample from the German KiGGS study.The proportion of youths with mental health problems (defined as abnormal SDQ total difficulties score) was, based on self-reports, 4.4% in the patient group and 2.9% in the general population (adjusted OR?=?1.61, p?=?0.044); and based on proxy reports, 7.9% in the patient group and 7.2% in the general population (OR?=?1.05, p?=?0.788). Youths with type 1 diabetes and self-reported mental health problems scored worse in the KINDL-R subscales of physical well-being (adjusted average difference ??=?-16.74, p<0.001) and family (??=?-11.09, p?=?0.017), and in the KINDL-R total score (??=?-8.09, p<0.001), than peers with self-reported mental health problems. The quality of life of diabetic adolescents and proxy-reported mental health problems did not differ from peers with proxy-reported mental health problems adjusted for confounders.Compared with the general population with mental health problems, the quality of life of adolescents with type 1 diabetes who report mental health problems is more severely impaired. This observation calls for early prevention and intervention as part of pediatric diabetes long-term care.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637957","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.773635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.760806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.680607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.480395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.479809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.463258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.321155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.274307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.258455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.242525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.2144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0225533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Peerage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
