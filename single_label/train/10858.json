{"id":10858,"title":"Preliminary investigation of cardiac troponin I concentration in cows with common production diseases.","abstract":"Increased cTnI concentrations are associated with adverse outcomes in humans and animals. Limited information is available on the prognostic value of cTnI in cows.To measure cTnI in cows with noncardiac diseases and evaluate the association of cTnI concentration with adverse outcomes such as death or early removal from the herd.Thirty control and 53 diseased cows.Serum cTnI concentrations were determined with a point-of-care immunoassay. Cows were diagnosed ante- or postmortem with metritis (n = 6), mastitis (n = 4), peritonitis (n = 6), LDA (n = 14), LDA and metritis (n = 4), pneumonia (n = 6), dystocia requiring cesarean section (n = 5), and downer cow syndrome (n = 8). Animal survival was determined for up to 2 months after presentation.The immunoassay showed reliability for the detection of bovine cTnI. Cows with LDA and metritis (P < .05), peritonitis (P < .05), LDA (P < .001), dystocia requiring cesarean section (P < .01), and downer cow syndrome (P < .001) had higher cTnI concentrations than control cows. The odds of a negative outcome (death or culling) for cows with cTnI concentrations of ? 0.05, ? 0.1, ? 0.2, and ? 0.5 ng/mL were 2.4, 2.9, 4.8, and 6.2, respectively.Cows with noncardiac diseases may have some degree of myocardial injury. The magnitude of cTnI increased may assist clinicians in evaluating the risk of an adverse outcome and help guide decision-making regarding treatment and prognosis.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627904","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Caesarean section","weight":0.674933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.627403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.621041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.615098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.532844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.504881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.464344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Mastitis","weight":0.454902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis"},{"name":"Depression (mood)","weight":0.421269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Downer (animal)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downer_(animal)"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Troponin I","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin_I"},{"name":"Metritis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metritis"},{"name":"Dystocia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystocia"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Betting in poker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_in_poker"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Reliability (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)"},{"name":"Culling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling"},{"name":"Richter magnitude scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"}]}
