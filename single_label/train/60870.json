{"id":60870,"title":"Eosinophils in hereditary and inflammatory myopathies.","abstract":"It is not known whether eosinophilic myositis is a specific histopathological feature of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2A (LGMD2A). Number and location of eosinophils in skeletal muscle biopsies (n=100) was analysed by Giemsa and modified hematoxylin/eosin staining in patients with genetically confirmed myopathies (LGMD2A, LGMD2B, LGMD2L, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, dystrophinopathy), histologically confirmed idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (neurogenic control), and normal controls. The number of eosinophils/mm² was significantly higher in LGMD2A, PM, DM, and sIBM compared to controls but not significantly higher than other myopathies. A large overlap in the number of eosinophils/mm2 between all groups was seen. In all disease groups eosinophils were mainly found endomysially (46- 88%) and intra- and perivascularly (4-37%). There was no correlation between the numbers of eosinophils/mm² and (i) age at biopsy and (ii) the duration of the disease. The extent of myopathic, fibrotic, and inflammatory changes did not differ in samples with high and low eosinophil count. Eosinophils seem to represent an unspecific histological finding in hereditary and inflammatory myopathies, but also amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","date":"2014-05-07","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24803842","annotations":[{"name":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"},{"name":"Dermatomyositis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatomyositis"},{"name":"Polymyositis","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyositis"},{"name":"Inclusion body myositis","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_body_myositis"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.845846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy","weight":0.831555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facioscapulohumeral_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Muscular dystrophy","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Myopathy","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopathy"},{"name":"Myositis","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myositis"},{"name":"Muscle biopsy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_biopsy"},{"name":"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy","weight":0.737047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb-girdle_muscular_dystrophy"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Inflammatory myopathy","weight":0.358106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_myopathy"},{"name":"Inclusion body","weight":0.234696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_body"},{"name":"Giemsa stain","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giemsa_stain"},{"name":"Eosinophilic","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0860629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Sclerosis (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerosis_(medicine)"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
