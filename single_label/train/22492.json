{"id":22492,"title":"Higher prevalence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among dental students.","abstract":"In order to test the hypothesis that more dental students are meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriers than non-dental students, 100 dental students with five to six years of exposure to patients and 81 non-dental students were tested for nasal and pharyngeal MRSA carriage by polymerase chain reaction. All 181 students were clinically healthy and none had taken antibiotics. Significantly more dental students (20/100) carried MRSA than non-dental students (5/81) (odds ratio: 4.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.6-12.6; P = 0.0033). Also, more dental students' mobile phones (8/100) carried MRSA. All MRSA isolates were distinguished by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis from epidemiologically significant strains. The results suggest that dental students are occupationally exposed to MRSA.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548405","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.826303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.627598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.496316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.406108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.361693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.328415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.198984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.14573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Human pharynx","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_pharynx"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mobile phone","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"581","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/581"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Carriage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage"},{"name":"Nasal cavity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cavity"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Asymptomatic carrier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Power Macintosh 8100","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_8100"},{"name":"The Metamorphosis (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Minuscule 181","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_181"}]}
