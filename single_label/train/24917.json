{"id":24917,"title":"Physician-industry collaboration: conflicts of interest and the imputation of motive.","abstract":"Policies about physicians' involvement with pharmaceutical companies spawn contradictory ideas. One set of policies aims to stimulate collaboration between private companies and publicly employed researchers to spur innovation and economic growth, another addresses what is seen as the problem of physicians' conflicts of interest stemming from industry collaboration. This article explores how these contradictory policies interact with everyday practice in clinical hypertension research in Denmark. I argue that 'corporate' and 'academic' research is entangled as physicians participate in industry trials to pursue their own research. Building on document analysis, observations of contract research, and interviews with clinician researchers and industry executives, I show how the establishment of industry 'ties' can serve as a way for physicians to navigate the constraints of research infrastructures and live up to intergenerational norms that knit the medical collective together. I discuss how this entanglement shapes medical research in ways that may run counter to the aims of medical innovation policies and that conflicts of interest policies do little to address. I conclude that appreciation of the ways in which economic and moral valuations come together is necessary to understand the conditions for medical research in an intertwined public-private research environment.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272611","annotations":[{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Academia","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia"},{"name":"Norm (sociology)","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(sociology)"},{"name":"Economic growth","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.681782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical industry","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.648965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Company","weight":0.643743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company"},{"name":"Innovation","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.43271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Contract","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract"},{"name":"Infrastructure","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"},{"name":"Conflict of interest","weight":0.298129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.286645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.244756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Moral","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Collective","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective"},{"name":"Privately held company","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Corporate title","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_title"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Contradiction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Valuation (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)"},{"name":"Doublethink","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink"}]}
