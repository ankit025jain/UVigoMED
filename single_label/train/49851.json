{"id":49851,"title":"[Effects of central precocious puberty on physical and sexual development in children].","abstract":"As abnormal pubertal development, central precocious puberty (CPP) is manifested by the secondary sexual characteristics, skeletal maturation, and physical development in advance. It ultimately affects the adult height of children, even producing some psychological and behavioral problems such as fear and anxiety. Currently, gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) is recognized as the best medicine worldwide for treating CPP in order to increase children's final adult height; however, it has some adverse effects on the growth and development of children. This paper reviews the effects of CPP and GnRHa on children's physical and sexual development, with the aim of increasing physicians awareness of this disease and the safety of medication.
