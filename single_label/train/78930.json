{"id":78930,"title":"Efficacy of a sound-based intervention with a child with an autism spectrum disorder and auditory sensory over-responsivity.","abstract":"Sound-based interventions (SBIs) are being used by paediatric occupational therapists to help children with autism spectrum disorders and co-morbid sensory processing disorders. A limited yet growing body of evidence is emerging related to the efficacy of SBIs in reducing sensory processing deficits among paediatric clients with co-morbid conditions. The current study employed an ABA single-subject case-controlled design, implementing The Listening ProgramÂ® with a 7-year-old child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder who demonstrated auditory sensory over-responsivity (SOR). The intervention consisted of 10?weeks of psycho-acoustically modified classical music that was delivered using specialized headphones and amplifier and a standard CD player. Repeated measures were conducted during the A(1), B and A(2) phases of the study using the Sensory Processing Measure, a subjective caregiver questionnaire, and the Sensory Over-Responsivity Scales, an examiner-based assessment measure to track changes of the participant's auditory SOR-related behaviours. The results indicated that the participant exhibited a decrease in the number of negative (avoidant, verbal and physical negative) and self-stimulatory behaviours. The decreases in negative and self-stimulatory behaviour may have been due to the therapeutic effect of the repeated exposure to the Sensory Over-Responsivity Scales or The Listening Program SBI.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532098","annotations":[{"name":"Autism","weight":0.761137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.523539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.522971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.419526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Autism spectrum","weight":0.395556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.391152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Psychoacoustics","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.320616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.30685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.281533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Music","weight":0.165593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"},{"name":"Avoidant personality disorder","weight":0.162206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Headphones","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.11315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0895501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Sensory system","weight":0.0584998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_system"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.0526725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Compact Disc player","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc_player"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Information processing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Verbal abuse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_abuse"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"GCE Advanced Level","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Spectrum (psychiatry)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"}]}
