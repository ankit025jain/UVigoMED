{"id":11656,"title":"Reduction of adenovirus 36-induced obesity and inflammation by mulberry extract.","abstract":"Adenovirus 36 (Ad36) is known to be associated with human obesity and to trigger inflammation in murine models. However, to date no clinical drugs for treating virus-induced obesity have been developed. Therefore, in this study, the anti-obesity and anti-inflammation effects of mulberry extract on Ad36 were evaluated in mice. The mulberry extract-fed group showed a reduction in total body weight and in epidermal fat pads. A combination of various mulberry components (1-deoxynojirimycin, kuromanin chloride and resveratrol) and a mulberry extract prevented viral replication by 50% and 70%, respectively, compared with an untreated Ad36-infected group. Moreover, the extract decreased both concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as MCP-1 and TNF-?, and the numbers of infiltrating immune cells and macrophages in epidermal fat pads. In conclusion, dietary mulberry extract might offer an avenue for the development of therapeutic approaches for treating or preventing virus-induced obesity and inflammation-related metabolic diseases.
