{"id":46020,"title":"A comparative study of degree of colorectal distention with manual air insufflation or automated CO(2) insufflation at CT colonography as a preoperative examination.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare the degree of colorectal distention between manual insufflation using room air and automatic insufflation using carbon dioxide for computed tomography colonography performed as a preoperative examination for patients with colon cancer.Participants comprised 200 patients who underwent computed tomography colonography immediately after colonoscopy from October 2011-2012. The first 100 patients were examined using manual insufflation, and the remaining 100 patients were examined using automated insufflation. Two radiologists independently assessed colorectal distention using a 4-point scale in six segments: cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. Mean scores of the two radiologists were used to analyze whether any differences existed between techniques in terms of the degree of distention per segment.Mean distention values for the colonic lumen were better using the automated technique than with the manual technique in both positions (p < 0.05). In segments, distention was significantly better using the automated technique than using the manual technique in the sigmoid and descending colon for prone patients, and in all segments for supine patients.Automated carbon dioxide insufflation offered significantly improved colorectal distention scores compared to manual room air insufflation.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652001","annotations":[{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Colonoscopy","weight":0.863895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy"},{"name":"Carbon dioxide","weight":0.846632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"},{"name":"Cecum","weight":0.835797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum"},{"name":"Descending colon","weight":0.826641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_colon"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Transverse colon","weight":0.814005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_colon"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Ascending colon","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_colon"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Insufflation (medicine)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insufflation_(medicine)"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"}]}
