{"id":83388,"title":"Avoiding patellar complications in total knee replacement.","abstract":"Patellofemoral complications are common after total knee replacement (TKR). Leaving the patellar unsurfaced after TKR may lead to complications such as anterior knee pain, and re-operation to surface it. Complications after patellar resurfacing include patellar fracture, aseptic loosening, patellar instability, polyethylene wear, patellar clunk and osteonecrosis. Historically, patellar complications account for one of the larger proportions of causes of failure in TKR, however, with contemporary implant designs, complication rates have decreased. Most remaining failures relate to patellofemoral tracking. Understanding the causes of patellofemoral maltracking is essential to prevent these complications as well as manage them when they occur.","date":"2014-11-08","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381415","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.719076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.643316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.535535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.448994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.393385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.281567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Ancient counties of England","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_counties_of_England"},{"name":"Team Knight Rider","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Knight_Rider"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Understanding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Geology of Venus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_Venus"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"}]}
