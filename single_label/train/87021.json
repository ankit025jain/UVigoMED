{"id":87021,"title":"Sequential determination of serum viral titers, virus-specific IgG antibodies, and TNF-?, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-? levels in patients with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.","abstract":"Although there have been a number of studies on the pathogenesis of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) recently, knowledge on this topic is still insufficient. This study aims to reveal the kinetics of serum CCHF virus (CCHFV) titers, serum levels of anti-CCHFV immunoglobulin (Ig)G, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-?, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)-? in CCHF patients.In total, 31 CCHF cases (11 fatal) were studied. Serum samples were obtained daily from all patients from the time of admission and continued for a 7-day hospitalization period for serologic (ELISA), virologic (real-time PCR), and cytokine (ELISA) analysis.The mean serum CCHFV titer at admission was 5.5E + 09 copies/mL in fatal cases and 5.7E + 08 copies/mL in survivors (p < 0.001). Compared to survivors, both the mean serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-? at admission were found to be significantly increased in fatal cases. The serum levels of IL-6, TNF-? and serum CCHFV titer at admission were significantly and positively correlated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scores (r = 0.626, p = 0.0002; r = 0.461, p = 0.009; and r = 0.625, p = 0.003, respectively). When the data obtained from the sequential determination of CCHFV titer and levels of anti-CCHFV IgG, IL-6, TNF-?, IL-10 and IFN-? were grouped according to the days of illness, the initial serum CCHFV titer of a fatal patient was 5.5E + 09 (copies/mL) and it was 6.1E + 09 (copies/mL) in a survivor on the 2 day of illness. While significant alterations were observed in all cytokines during the monitoring period, IL-6 levels remained consistently higher in fatal cases and TNF-? levels increased in both in fatal and non-fatal CCHF cases.The increased CCHFV load and higher concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-?, the presence of DIC, and the absence of CCHFV specific immunity are strongly associated with death in CCHF.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25066751","annotations":[{"name":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.893481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Virology","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Viral hemorrhagic fever","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hemorrhagic_fever"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.743269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"}]}
