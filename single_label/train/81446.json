{"id":81446,"title":"Predicting geographically distributed adult dental decay in the greater Auckland region of New Zealand.","abstract":"To model the geographic distribution of current (and treated) dental decay on a high-resolution geographic basis for the Auckland region of New Zealand.The application of matrix-based mathematics to modelling adult dental disease-based on known population risk profiles to provide a detailed map of the dental caries distribution for the greater Auckland region.Of the 29 million teeth in adults in the region some 1.2 million (4%) are suffering decay whilst 7.2 million (25%) have previously suffered decay and are now restored.The model provides a high-resolution picture of where the disease burden lies geographically and presents to health planners a method for developing future service plans.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055605","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.629513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.369573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.362411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.114832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0988814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Map","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Auckland","weight":0.040579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Regions of New Zealand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_New_Zealand"},{"name":"Electric power distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"},{"name":"Auckland Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Region"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease burden","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden"}]}
