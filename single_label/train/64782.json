{"id":64782,"title":"[Influence of Kudou Shencha decotion on INF-gamma, ICAM-1, MCP-1 levels of prostate tissue homogenate in immunity prostatitis model rats].","abstract":"To investigate the influence of Kudou Shencha decotion on INF-y, ICAM-1, MCP-1 levels of prostate tissue homogenate in immunity prostatitis model rats.Forty Wistar male rats were divided into 5 groups randomly: Kudou Shencha decotion group with high dosage and low dosage, Qianleitai group, the model control group and normal group. The rat model of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis was established by multiple hypodermical injection of the suspension of prostatic protein purification with Freund's completed adjuvant. The level of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), interferon gamma (INF-gamma) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The content of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 in the model group was higher than that of the normal group (P < 0.05), the content of ICAM-1 was obviously decreased in Kudou Shencha decotion group with high dosage (P <0.05), the contents of MCP-1 were all obviously decreased in Kudou Shencha decotion groups and Qianlietai group. Compared with the model group, the contents of INF-gamma in all treatment groups were decreased insignificantly.Kudou Shencha decotion has the action of lowering the level of ICAM-1 and MCP-1, which may be one of the mechanisms of Kudou Shencha decotion in the therapy of chronic prostatitis.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282906","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.901493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Prostatitis","weight":0.895565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"},{"name":"Monocyte","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocyte"},{"name":"Interferon-gamma","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon-gamma"},{"name":"Chemotaxis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Chemokine","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemokine"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.734246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.674151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.597081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.534913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.400137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.277237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"CCL2","weight":0.273267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL2"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.222807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.175302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"},{"name":"Homogenization (biology)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(biology)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
