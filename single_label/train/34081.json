{"id":34081,"title":"Surgical treatment of vascular malformations of the facial bones.","abstract":"To characterize intraosseous vascular malformations and describe the most appropriate approach for treatment according to clinical experience and a review of the published data.We performed a retrospective review of 11 vascular malformations (7 venous and 4 arteriovenous) of the facial bones treated during a 10-year period using en bloc resection or intraoral aggressive curettage alone or preceded by endovascular embolization. Corrective surgery was planned to address any residual bone deformities. The cases were reviewed at a mean follow-up point of 6 years.Facial symmetry was restored in the cases requiring reconstruction. Tooth sparing was possible in the case of jaw and/or maxillary localization. Recanalization occurred in 14% of the venous and 33% of the arteriovenous malformations.Facial intraosseous venous malformations can be successfully treated using surgery alone. Facial intraosseous arteriovenous malformations will be better addressed using combined approaches. Aggressive curettage will obviate the need for extensive surgical resection in selected cases.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768420","annotations":[{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.778454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.666252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.63861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.592663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Curettage","weight":0.514744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curettage"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.468416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.361706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Arteriovenous malformation","weight":0.249069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_malformation"},{"name":"Osteochondrodysplasia","weight":0.121109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondrodysplasia"},{"name":"Facial skeleton","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_skeleton"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Intraosseous infusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraosseous_infusion"},{"name":"Facial symmetry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_symmetry"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Monobloc engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monobloc_engine"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"}]}
