{"id":82209,"title":"Acceptability of the Hall Technique to parents and children.","abstract":"To investigate the acceptability of stainless steel crowns placed by dental therapists on children's primary molars using the Hall Technique.Mixed methods approach, using qualitative inductive analysis and quantitative analysis.Hawke's Bay Community Oral Health ServiceOne focus group was conducted and ten thirty-minute phone interviews were undertaken with parents of children who had previously had a stainless steel crown placed using the Hall Technique (over the period 1 December 2011 to 31 May 2012). An inductive approach was used to analyse the qualitative research data, and the information was arranged into several categories based on the key themes which arose. Children treated with the Hall Technique were asked immediately after treatment whether they had enjoyed their visit to the clinic that day.Common themes were found with regard to appearance, pain, the procedure, and general opinions on acceptability. Nearly all (90%) of the children responded positively about their visit to the clinic.There was a high degree of acceptance among both parents and children for stainless steel crown placement using the Hall Technique in this group.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683915","annotations":[{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.676505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.594254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.551409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.431296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.255468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.165593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.162483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Focus group","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Steel","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Hawke's Bay Region","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawke's_Bay_Region"},{"name":"Stainless steel","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Arrangement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement"},{"name":"May 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_31"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Common (entertainer)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)"},{"name":"Technique (album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technique_(album)"},{"name":"Dental therapist","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_therapist"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
