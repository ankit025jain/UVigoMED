{"id":77431,"title":"Latex glove-related symptoms among health care workers: a self-report questionnaire-based survey.","abstract":"The use of latex gloves by health care workers (HCWs) can lead to multiple symptoms: eczema, contact urticaria, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis.The objectives of this study were to reveal the prevalence of latex glove-related symptoms of HCWs at Siriraj Hospital and to determine risk factors associated with those symptoms associated with the use of latex gloves.Self-administered questionnaires were sent to 6880 HCWs who were working at Siriraj Hospital and using latex rubber gloves in their duty.The questionnaire response rate was 65.8%. Of 4529 respondents, the male-to-female ratio was 1:8.6 and the mean age was 34.3 years. The majority of respondents were nurses (83%). The prevalence of glove-related symptoms among the HCWs is 13.3%. Glove-related cutaneous and noncutaneous symptoms were found in 11.3% and 5.9% of the respondents.The hospital housekeepers emerged as the job with the significantly higher prevalence rate of glove-related symptoms than that of the other job categories. Factors associated with glove-related cutaneous symptoms are frequency and duration of glove use, history of atopy, and history of allergy to fruit cross-reacting with latex. The quantity of glove use, history of atopy, and allergy to fruits cross-reacting with latex are risk factors for the occurrence of glove-related noncutaneous symptoms.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819288","annotations":[{"name":"Anaphylaxis","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.879374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.851842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Conjunctivitis","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.694598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.659352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.608502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.540243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Fruit","weight":0.425161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.27827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.178514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Natural rubber","weight":0.145345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber"},{"name":"Medical glove","weight":0.124493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_glove"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.119465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Rubber glove","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_glove"},{"name":"Glove","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
