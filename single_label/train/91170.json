{"id":91170,"title":"Access-related complications in anterior lumbar surgery in patients over 60 years of age.","abstract":"The anterior approach is widely used for access to the lumbar spine in the setting of adult deformity either as a stand-alone procedure or in combined anterior-posterior procedures. Access-related complication rates have so far not been reported in an elderly patient population, in which it has been suggested that anterior lumbar surgery is indicated with caution. Here, the complication rates in patients over 60 years of age are reported.A retrospective chart review in a consecutive series of 31 patients over 60 years of age and in which a retroperitoneal access to the lumbar spine was performed. All charts including anaesthetic charts were reviewed and the patients' demographics, exact surgical procedure, comorbidities, and potential risk factors, as well as intraoperative and vascular complications noted. Patients who had revision anterior surgery, anterior surgery for tumour resection, trauma or infection were excluded.The average age of patients was 64.9 years, ranging 60-81. Eighteen patients were female and 13 male. The average body mass index was 26.7 ranging 18.5-44.0. The indications for surgery were degenerative scoliosis (12 patients), degenerative spondylosis (7 patients), degenerative spondylolisthesis (5 patients), iatrogenic spondylolisthesis following prior posterior decompression (5 patients), and pseudarthrosis following posterolateral instrumented fusion (2 patients). In 10 patients, a single-level anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) was carried out (1 L3/4, 5 L4/5, 4 L5/S1) and in 11 patients ALIF was performed on two levels (1 L2-4, 1 L3-5, 9 L4-S1). In three patients, 3 levels from L3 to S1 were approached and in seven patients 4 levels from L2 to S1. Patients with three- and four-level anterior lumbar surgery had higher blood loss than two- and one-level surgery (616 ± 340 vs 439 ± 238, p = 0.036). The overall complication rate was 29% (9/31), which included four vascular injuries and one pulmonary embolism. The vascular complication rate was 13% (4/31) with two arterial and two venous injuries requiring repair. No major blood loss over 2,000 ml occurred.Anterior lumbar surgery in an elderly population does not necessarily have higher overall complication rates than in a younger population. The risk of vascular injury requiring repair was higher, but has not resulted in major blood loss and the procedure therefore can be carried out safely. The overall complication rate and blood loss compare favourably to complication rates in posterior adult deformity procedures.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and
