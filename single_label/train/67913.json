{"id":67913,"title":"Effects of AST-120 on blood concentrations of protein-bound uremic toxins and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in chronic dialysis patients.","abstract":"Removal of protein-bound uremic toxins by dialysis therapy is limited. The effect of oral adsorbent AST-120 in chronic dialysis patients has rarely been investigated.AST-120 was administered 6.0 g/day for 3 months in 69 chronic dialysis patients. The blood concentrations of indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol sulfate and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk were determined before and after AST-120 treatment.AST-120 significantly decreased both the total and free forms of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate ranging from 21.9 to 58.3%. There were significant simultaneous changes of the soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK, 24% increase), malondialdehyde (14% decrease) and interleukin-6 (19% decrease). A significant association between the decrease of indoxyl sulfate and changes of sTWEAK and interleukin-6 was noted.AST-120 effectively decreased indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate levels in both total and free forms. AST-120 also improved the profile of cardiovascular biomarkers.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576840","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.815177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.710647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.578454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.569012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.558026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Adsorption","weight":0.535634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.3182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.272868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Uremia","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uremia"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.188801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Indoxyl","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoxyl"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"}]}
