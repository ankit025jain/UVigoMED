{"id":72953,"title":"Knockdown of miR-210 decreases hypoxic glioma stem cells stemness and radioresistance.","abstract":"Glioma contains abundant hypoxic regions which provide niches to promote the maintenance and expansion of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are resistant to conventional therapies and responsible for recurrence. Given the fact that miR-210 plays a vital role in cellular adaption to hypoxia and in stem cell survival and stemness maintenance, strategies correcting the aberrantly expressed miR-210 might open up a new therapeutic avenue to hypoxia GSCs. In the present study, to explore the possibility of miR-210 as an effective therapeutic target to hypoxic GSCs, we employed a lentiviral-mediated anti-sense miR-210 gene transfer technique to knockdown miR-210 expression and analyze phenotypic changes in hypoxic U87s and SHG44s cells. We found that hypoxia led to an increased HIF-2? mRNA expression and miR-210 expression in GSCs. Knockdown of miR-210 decreased neurosphere formation capacity, stem cell marker expression and cell viability, and induced differentiation and G0/G1 arrest in hypoxic GSCs by partially rescued Myc antagonist (MNT) protein expression. Knockdown of MNT could reverse the gene expression changes and the growth inhibition resulting from knockdown of miR-210 in hypoxic GSCs. Moreover, knockdown of miR-210 led to increased apoptotic rate and Caspase-3/7 activity and decreased invasive capacity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactate production and radioresistance in hypoxic GSCs. These findings suggest that miR-210 might be a potential therapeutic target to eliminate GSCs located in hypoxic niches.
