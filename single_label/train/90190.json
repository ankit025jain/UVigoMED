{"id":90190,"title":"Comparison between cast immobilization versus volar locking plate fixation of distal radius fractures in active elderly patients, the Asian perspective.","abstract":"Displaced distal radius fractures in active elderly patients with high functional demand present a clinical dilemma because current evidence is equivocal in the recommendation of treatment. Internal fixation is an increasingly popular option with proposed superior results. Our study aims to evaluate the results among a population of active elderly patients with displaced fractures managed with either cast immobilization or internal fixation with volar locking plate. Seventy-five patients (35 cast immobilization and 40 internal fixation) with mean age of 74 Â± 7.5 years with minimum of 12 months follow-up were studied. The radiological and clinical parameters were assessed at three, six, and 12 months. Functional outcomes (DASH, Green-O'Brien) were assessed at 12 months. Patients who underwent surgery regain wrist motion and grip strength earlier, but this was not statistically significant after six months.
