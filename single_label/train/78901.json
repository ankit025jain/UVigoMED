{"id":78901,"title":"The case for mistletoe in the treatment of laryngeal cancer.","abstract":"Complementary and alternative medicine usage, though rising, remains largely devoid of a sound scientific basis; however, there is increasing evidence to support its use in cancer therapy.To present the case of a patient with laryngeal carcinoma who made a full recovery following mistletoe therapy, despite failing to respond to chemoradiotherapy and salvage laryngectomy.Case report with relevant literature review.The patient developed extensive, unresectable stomal recurrence, and it was deemed appropriate to supply palliative care only. Following treatment with mistletoe extract injections after palliative radiotherapy, he recovered fully and was eventually discharged from care.The benefit of mistletoe in laryngeal cancer treatment requires further investigation, and might be considered in selected patients, as an adjunct or when other conventional therapies have failed.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548675","annotations":[{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Laryngectomy","weight":0.866178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy"},{"name":"Larynx","weight":0.838126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.732614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.621736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.446948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laryngeal cancer","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_cancer"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Sound","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"},{"name":"Management of cancer","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_cancer"},{"name":"Mistletoe","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistletoe"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Case Western Reserve University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Alternative cancer treatments","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_cancer_treatments"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"}]}
