{"id":55724,"title":"Factors associated with the angle of exodeviation in patients with recurrent exotropia.","abstract":"To compare preoperative and postoperative distance deviation angle in recurrent exotropes, and to determine factors associated with large-angle recurrent exotropia.In recurrent exotropes who were followed-up more than 2 years postoperatively, the largest angle after recurrence (LAAR) was compared with the preoperative deviation angle (PA). Patients were classified into those who had LAAR<PA and LAAR?PA. Differences in clinical factors between groups were examined.Among 242 exotropes who underwent surgery, and followed-up for more than 2 years postoperatively, 83 showed recurrent exotropia. Mean age at surgery was 5.7 ± 2.4 years, and mean postoperative follow-up was 36.2 ± 11.3 months. The bigger the preoperative angle, the bigger the angle of recurrence is. However, the smaller the preoperative angle, the angle of recurrence grows closer to the preoperative one. Only six showed bigger recurrence (LAAR?PA), and these patients had a smaller mean preoperative angle (p=0.01) compared to patients whose angle of recurrence was smaller than the preoperative one. Among the patients with LAAR<PA, type of exotropia (p=0.03) and preoperative constant deviation (p=0.02) was associated with PA-LAAR?5(?).Although the overall incidence of recurrent exotropia with a relatively large angle (LAAR?PA) is low among patients who underwent surgery for exotropia (2.5%), the possibility of this phenomenon should be noted. The ratio of relatively large angle recurrence was higher in patients with a small preoperative exodeviation and basic type exotropia.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825841","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.276466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Exotropia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotropia"},{"name":"Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Attack/Armed_Reconnaissance"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Recurrence relation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Closer (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
