{"id":9632,"title":"Emerging genetic basis of osteochondritis dissecans.","abstract":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide an unbiased approach in the identification of genes that increase the risk for osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). Recent GWAS in humans, horses, and pigs are reviewed and genes identified. The identified genes tended to cluster with respect to function and biologic processes. GWAS in humans are a critical next step in the effort to provide a better understanding of the causes of OCD, which will, in turn, allow preventive strategies for treatment of adolescents and young adults who are at risk for the development of degenerative joint disease due to the effects of OCD.
