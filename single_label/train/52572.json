{"id":52572,"title":"Effect of cinacalcet treatment on vascular arterial stiffness among peritoneal dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.","abstract":"Although calcimimetics cinacalcet can reduce parathyroid hormone level and control secondary hyperparathyroidism in end-stage renal disease patients, risk of vascular calcification remains high. Whether cinacalcet can further reduce vascular damage or arterial stiffness is unknown.We studied the effect of cinacalcet in 33 peritoneal dialysis patients with inadequately controlled secondary hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment. The primary outcome was the aortic pulse wave velocity at 26 and 52 months after cinacalcet treatment. The pulse wave velocity was compared with that of a matched control cohort of 37 peritoneal dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.Thirty-three patients completed the cinacalcet treatment, after median dialysis duration of 1.0 year. Significant improvement of parathyroid hormone level was achieved after 52 weeks, from 87.5 ± 28.7 pmol/L to 34.5 ± 45.5 pmol/L (P < 0.0001). Serial carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity did not differ between cinacalcet treatment group and control group (general linear model with repeated measures, P = 0.19). Among patients receiving cinacalcet, the average carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity increased from 10.46 ± 2.12 m/s at baseline to 11.41 ± 2.79 m/s at 52 weeks (P = 0.001). The change in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity over 1 year had no significant correlation with the final parathyroid hormone level or change in parathyroid hormone level.Among prevalent patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and with hyperparathyroidism, a reduction of 60.6% parathyroid hormone level after cinacalcet treatment for one year did not reduce the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589316","annotations":[{"name":"Parathyroid hormone","weight":0.879193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.803905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.736718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.716849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Parathyroid gland","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_gland"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.65261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.536394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.406078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Calcification","weight":0.403169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcification"},{"name":"Peritoneal dialysis","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_dialysis"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.283688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.264124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Cinacalcet","weight":0.203079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinacalcet"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.0400049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"General linear model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_model"},{"name":"Pulse wave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_wave"},{"name":"Arterial stiffness","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arterial_stiffness"},{"name":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_hyperparathyroidism"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"General linear group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Repeated measures design","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Linear model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Wave","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"}]}
