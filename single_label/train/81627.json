{"id":81627,"title":"A method for fabrication of implant-supported fixed partial dentures.","abstract":"When restoring a partially edentulous arch with an implant-supported fixed partial denture, the optimal fit and function of the final restoration depend on the fabrication of an accurate impression and the registration of the interocclusal relationship. The present case report presents a method for the fabrication of impressions and the registration of the interocclusal relationship for implant-supported partial dentures. The described method allows the accurate transfer of the implant position and the registration of the interocclusal relationship using transfer key and electroformed gold copings. The key and copings were used to transfer the intraoral implant position to the cast, to position the abutments intraorally, and to facilitate the fabrication of the final partial denture.
