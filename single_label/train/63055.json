{"id":63055,"title":"Lymphocele: prevalence and management in gynecological malignancies.","abstract":"A lymphocele is a cystic mass that may occur in the retroperitoneum following a systematic pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Lymphoceles may be the cause of severe morbidity, or rarely mortality. Symptomatic lymphoceles manifest with pain, compression of adjacent structures, lymphoedema, deep vein thrombosis or inflammation. The morbidity associated with a symptomatic lymphocele may reduce the quality of life of a patient, as well as delay subsequent cancer treatment. The number and positivity of removed lymph nodes, surgical approach, type of tumor, radiotherapy and BMI rate are among the most discussed risk factors of lymphocele formation. The incidence of postoperative lymphocele is reported in the broad range of 1-58%; 5-18% of those who are symptomatic. Only symptomatic lymphoceles should be treated. Mini-invasive methods involving catheter drainage and sclerotization tend to prevail. Surgery either via laparoscopy or laparotomy remains an option in recurring, poorly accessible or inflammatory lymphoceles.
