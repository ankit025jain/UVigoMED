{"id":14915,"title":"Associations between bacterial genotype and outcome of bovine clinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis.","abstract":"Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of clinical mastitis in dairy cows worldwide. The cure rate after antimicrobial treatment of clinical S. aureus mastitis is very variable due to both cow and bacterial factors. Studies have shown that bacterial genotype might affect short-term bacteriological and clinical cure, but the long-term outcome has been less studied. The objectives of this study were to investigate associations between bacterial genotype and long-term outcome of veterinary-treated clinical mastitis (VTCM) caused by S. aureus during a follow-up period of 120 days and to study genotype variation among Swedish S. aureus isolates. S. aureus isolates from cases of VTCM were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Long-term outcome measurements used were somatic cell count (SCC), additional diagnoses of VTCM, milk yield and culling. Isolates were classified into clusters (>80% similarity) and pulsotypes (100% similarity). Clusters and pulsotypes were grouped according to occurrence. Multivariable mixed-effect linear regression models including cow and bacterial factors with possible influence on SCC or milk yield were used to calculate differences in SCC or milk yield between groups. Additional outcome measures were calculated using a test of proportions.The isolates (n?=?185) were divided into 18 clusters and 29 pulsotypes. Two pulsotypes were classified as common, and were found in 64% of the cases of VTCM. Remaining isolates were classified as less common or rare pulsotypes. The distribution was similar at cluster level. Outcome was calculated from follow-up data on 111 cows. Significantly lower SCC during the follow-up period was found in cows infected with common clusters compared to in cows infected with less common/rare clusters. The proportion of cows with SCC <200 000 cells/ml during the whole follow-up period was significantly higher in the group common clusters than in the group less common/rare clusters. Bacterial genotype did not influence the other outcome parameters.In Sweden, two S. aureus pulsotypes, identified in about 64% of clinical S. aureus cases, were widespread. Cows infected with the common genotypes had significantly lower SCC during 120 days after treatment compared to cows infected with less common or rare genotypes.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397927","annotations":[{"name":"Mastitis","weight":0.890996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastitis"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.848546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Somatic cell","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Somatic cell count","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell_count"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.667607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.634476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Gel electrophoresis","weight":0.619924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.614952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Milk","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.592413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.58715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.528287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.494667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.400546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Dairy","weight":0.398697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.38467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.382862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.322924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.244818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.201356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Culling","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Dairy cattle","weight":0.0375893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Inflorescence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Leaf shape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_shape"},{"name":"Crop yield","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"}]}
