{"id":69385,"title":"GATA2 as a potential metastasis-driving gene in prostate cancer.","abstract":"Effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is critically needed. The present study was aimed at identifying metastasis-driving genes as potential targets for therapy (oncotargets). A differential gene expression profile of metastatic LTL-313H and non-metastatic LTL-313B prostate cancer tissue xenografts, derived from one patient's specimen, was subjected to integrative analysis using the Ingenuity Upstream Regulator Analysis tool. Six candidate master regulatory genes were identified, including GATA2, a gene encoding a pioneer factor, a special transcription factor facilitating the recruitment of additional transcription factors. Elevated GATA2 expression in metastatic prostate cancer tissues correlated with poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, GATA2 gene silencing in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells led to a marked reduction in cell migration, tissue invasion, focal adhesion disassembly and to a dramatic change in cell transcriptomes, indicating that GATA2 plays a critical role in prostate cancer metastasis. As such, GATA2 could represent a prostate cancer metastasis-driving gene and a potential target for therapy of metastatic prostate cancer.
