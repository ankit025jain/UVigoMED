{"id":63928,"title":"Bullous Sweet's syndrome after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy in a child with congenital neutropenia.","abstract":"We present the case of a 20-month-old boy with congenital neutropenia for which he was being treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) who developed bullous Sweet's syndrome. Because of the challenging and extensive differential diagnosis of an acute bullous eruption in an immunocompromised child, we highlight the importance of a prompt and precise diagnosis before initiation of any systemic therapy in children with Sweet's syndrome.
