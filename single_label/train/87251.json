{"id":87251,"title":"[Diagnosis and treatment of associated injuries of the pelvis].","abstract":"The aim of investigation is improvement of treatment results of unstable injuries in the pelvic ring in patients with severe associated injuries. An experience of treatment of 533 patients with unstable pelvic injuries is presented. Diagnostic measures take into account the severity of the condition of the victim. Stage treatment with consecutive performing of temporary external immobilization of the pelvis and following final osteosynthesis was optimal. Replacement of external fixation for submersible osteosynthesis held in stable or terminal condition of the victim. Developed treatment of patients with pelvic injuries decreased mortality to 8.4%, number of general complications to 11.6% and number of local complications to 8.7%. Also it decreased length of hospital stay to 35.5 days and provided excellent and good functional results of treatment in 78.9% of cases.
