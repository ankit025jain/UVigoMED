{"id":71419,"title":"EGF receptor uses SOS1 to drive constitutive activation of NF?B in cancer cells.","abstract":"Activation of nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) is a central event in the responses of normal cells to inflammatory signals, and the abnormal constitutive activation of NF?B is important for the survival of most cancer cells. In nonmalignant human cells, EGF stimulates robust activation of NF?B. The kinase activity of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is required, because the potent and specific inhibitor erlotinib blocks the response. Down-regulating EGFR expression or inhibiting EGFR with erlotinib impairs constitutive NF?B activation in several different types of cancer cells and, conversely, increased activation of NF?B leads to erlotinib resistance in these cells. We conclude that EGF is an important mediator of NF?B activation in cancer cells. To explore the mechanism, we selected an erlotinib-resistant cell line in which the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of Sevenless 1 (SOS1), well known to be important for EGF-dependent signaling to MAP kinases, is overexpressed. Increased expression of SOS1 increases NF?B activation in several different types of cancer cells, and ablation of SOS1 inhibits EGF-induced NF?B activation in these cells, indicating that SOS1 is a functional component of the pathway connecting EGFR to NF?B activation. Importantly, the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of SOS1 is not required for NF?B activation.
