{"id":46223,"title":"Ethanolic extract from Derris scandens Benth mediates radiosensitzation via two distinct modes of cell death in human colon cancer HT-29 cells.","abstract":"Enhancing of radioresponsiveness of tumors by using radiosensitizers is a promising approach to increase the efficacy of radiation therapy. Recently, the ethanolic extract of the medicinal plant, Derris scandens Benth has been identified as a potent radiosensitizer of human colon cancer HT29 cells. However, cell death mechanisms underlying radiosensitization activity of D scandens extract have not been identified. Here, we show that treatment of HT-29 cells with D scandens extract in combination with gamma irradiation synergistically sensitizes HT-29 cells to cell lethality by apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe. Furthermore, the extract was found to decrease Erk1/2 activation. These findings suggest that D scandens extract mediates radiosensitization via at least two distinct modes of cell death and silences pro-survival signaling in HT-29 cells.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641423","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.773069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiosensitizer","weight":0.709789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosensitizer"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.585087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.449442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.269962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.117206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Chernobyl disaster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"}]}
