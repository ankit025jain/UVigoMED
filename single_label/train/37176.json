{"id":37176,"title":"Bronchogenic cyst in the intradiaphragmatic location.","abstract":"Bronchogenic cysts are congenital foregut malformations thought to develop due to abnormal budding of tracheal diverticulumand proximal bronchial structures during embryologic development. The cyst is lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium and the wall contains cartilage and layers of smooth muscle. These lesions most commonly are seen in the mediastinum, lung, or pleural spaces. The intradiaphragmatic location of the bronchogenic cyst rarely has been reported in the literature. We report the clinical presentation and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings in a pediatric patient who presented with left-sided chest pain and was found to have a mass in the region of the diaphragm.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511867","annotations":[{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.875947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Chest pain","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain"},{"name":"Embryogenesis","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryogenesis"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Embryology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryology"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.743415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.719069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.706221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Cilium","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.613936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.542599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Foregut","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foregut"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.310125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.205435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Columnar epithelial cell","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnar_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Budding","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budding"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
