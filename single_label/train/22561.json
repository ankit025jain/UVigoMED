{"id":22561,"title":"Mitral valve repair in active infective endocarditis with cerebral infarction.","abstract":"A 19-year-old woman, who had a recent extensive cerebral infarction caused by a septic embolization in the left-sided territory of the middle cerebral artery, successfully underwent mitral valve repair for severe mitral regurgitation caused by active infective endocarditis, 24?h after the onset of stroke. Anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass was maintained with low-dose heparin and additional nafamostat mesilate. She had no further aggravation of the brain complication and recovered well with midterm mitral valve durability.
