{"id":8800,"title":"Role of transportation in spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection, United States.","abstract":"After porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was detected in the United States in 2013, we tested environmental samples from trailers in which pigs had been transported. PEDV was found in 5.2% of trailers not contaminated at arrival, , suggesting that the transport process is a source of transmission if adequate hygiene measures are not implemented.
