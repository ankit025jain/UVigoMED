{"id":84495,"title":"Fibula allograft sandwich technique for the reconstruction of sternal nonunion after cardiac surgery.","abstract":"Sternal dehiscence is an untoward complication of cardiac surgery that leads to increased morbidity as well as length of hospital stay and costs. Although many different conventional and creative techniques have been described using both synthetic and biologic materials, the ideal method ofÂ sternal reconstruction is still controversial. In this case, we describe a simple and reproducible \"fibula allograft sandwich technique\" for the reconstruction of sternal nonunion in a cardiac surgery patient. This technique also facilitates the conventional wiring by creating bilateral landing zones for the wires at both sides of the sternum.
