{"id":56000,"title":"Hand preference of individuals with blindness in everyday activities: The effects of age of sight loss, age, and gender.","abstract":"The research aims of the present study were: (a) to assess the hand preference of blind persons in everyday activities on the basis of gender, type of blindness, and age; and (b) to conduct the above analysis at both the item level and the latent trait level, after concluding the optimum factor structure of the instrument. Participants were 82 individuals with visual impairments and blindness. Their mean age was 29.99 years. Handedness was evaluated using a modified version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). When comparing handedness preferences across age of sight loss, gender, and age groups results indicated that there were significant differences in preference for several everyday tasks across age of sight loss and age groups but not gender. These results were also confirmed at the latent-trait mean level. The present findings add to the extant literature that highlighted hand preferences for individuals with visual impairments and blindness.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767801","annotations":[{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.607955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Edinburgh","weight":0.355396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.201351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Extant taxon","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_taxon"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Handedness","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Extant literature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_literature"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Preference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Latent variable model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable_model"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Inventory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
