{"id":30781,"title":"Evaluation of cognitive characteristics of patients developing manifestations of parkinsonism secondary to long-term ephedrone use.","abstract":"In this study, cognitive functions of 9 patients developing parkinsonism due to chronic manganese intoxication by intravenous methcathinone solution were investigated using detailed neuropsychometric tests.Attention deficit, verbal and nonverbal memory, visuospatial function, constructive ability, language, and executive (frontal) functions of 9 patients who were admitted to our clinic with manifestations of chronic manganese intoxication and 9 control subjects were assessed using neuropsychometric tests. Two years later, detailed repeat neuropsychometric tests were performed in the patient group. The results were evaluated using the ?(2) test, Fisher's exact probability test, Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney U test.While there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in language functions, visuospatial functions and constructive ability, a statistically significant difference was noted between both groups regarding attention (p = 0.032), calculation (p = 0.004), recall and recognition domains of verbal memory, nonverbal memory (p = 0.021) and some domains of frontal functions (Stroop-5 and spontaneous recovery) (p = 0.022 and 0.012). Repeat neuropsychometric test results of the patients were not statistically significant 2 years later.It has been observed that cognitive dysfunction seen in parkinsonism secondary to chronic manganese intoxication may be long-lasting and may not recover as observed in motor dysfunction.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Chemically-Induced
