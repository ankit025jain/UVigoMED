{"id":43610,"title":"Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of FOXM1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a poor prognosis because invasion and metastasis are prevalent. To improve diagnosis, it is important to identify and characterize tumor-specific molecular markers in ESCC. FOXM1 is overexpressed and correlates with pathogenesis in a variety of human malignancies. We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of FOXM1 overexpression in ESCC.FOXM1 expression was assessed in ESCC specimens from 174 curatively-resected cases. The relationships between FOXM1 expression, clinicopathological parameters, and prognoses were examined.Immunohistochemical analysis showed that 94 (54.0%) tumors were positive for FOXM1 expression. FOXM1 positivity did not correlate with any clinicopathological parameter. However, FOXM1-positive cases had poorer prognoses than FOXM1-negative ones (p=0.0037, log-rank test). In multivariate analysis, the following were independent prognostic factors: pT, pN, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and FOXM1 expression (hazard ratio=1.69, 95% confidence interval=1.06-2.75, p=0.027).FOXM1 may be a novel prognostic factor in patients with ESCC who undergo curative resection.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778055","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.724114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.712304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.661506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.492058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.419125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.398882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.372209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Newton (unit)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
