{"id":87451,"title":"[Treatment of post-menopausic osteoporosis: what's new in 2014?].","abstract":"Management of osteoporosis involves both non pharmacological approaches, including changes in lifestyle and dietary habits combined, in patients at high risk of fracture or presenting with an established osteoporosis, to the use of drugs. Besides supplementation in calcium and vitamin D (at daily doses of 1 gr and 800 IU) in patients whose dietary intakes do not cover the recommended daily allowances, medications to be used for the management of osteoporosis may include inhibitors of bone resorption (bisphosphonates, denosumab and selective estrogen receptor modulators), stimulators of bone formation (teriparatide) or chemical entities decreasing bone resorption and stimulating bone formation (strontium ranelate). The selection of a particular medication, for a single individual patient, will depend on the severity of the disease as well as on the patient's believes and expectations. Local, skeletal and systemic tolerance of the various drugs should also be taken into account.","date":"2014-08-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158386","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.87818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Estrogen receptor","weight":0.799169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.791478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.667554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.65997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Skeleton","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.543316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Selective estrogen receptor modulator","weight":0.523267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_estrogen_receptor_modulator"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.490028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Teriparatide","weight":0.425458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriparatide"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.231829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Strontium ranelate","weight":0.122478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium_ranelate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Denosumab","weight":0.0561906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denosumab"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0437018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Strontium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
