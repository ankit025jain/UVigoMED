{"id":43483,"title":"[Analysis of clinicopathological features of 1879 cases of gastric cancer in Southern China: a single center experience].","abstract":"To investigate the clinicopathological features of gastric cancer in Southern China, and provide a base of research and therapy for gastric cancer.A total of 1 879 cases of gastric cancer with radical gastrectomy from Southern China were collected from August 1994 to July 2012. Analyze and summarize the characters of gender, age, tumor location, WHO histopathologic type and grade, pTNM stage and family history, retrospectively.Among all cases, male to female ratio was 2.08: 1, while female was more than male before 40 years (?(2) = 77.831, P = 0.000). Cases aged over 60 years had a highest incidence of gastric cancer (46.0%), with predilection of sinus (45.7%), body (26.3%) and cardia (20.1%). The common WHO histopathologic types were tubular or papillary adenocarcinoma (81.5%) and signet ring cell carcinoma (11.0%). Most patients were at III or IV stage on pTNM staging (40.5% and 26.5%).Gastric cancer in Southern China has a predilection on male, while female is more than male before 40 years. Gastric sinus and adenocarcinoma is most common. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24785452","annotations":[{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Signet ring cell carcinoma","weight":0.858244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.768754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.746318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cardia","weight":0.744102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardia"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.730052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.687702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.641092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"China","weight":0.52611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.364424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.213454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Trans woman","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Signet ring cell","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring_cell"},{"name":"Signet ring","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signet_ring"},{"name":"Papillary adenocarcinoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Seal (emblem)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(emblem)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"1994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Southern Africa","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa"},{"name":"Northern and southern China","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China"}]}
