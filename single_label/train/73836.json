{"id":73836,"title":"Attenuated neuroprotective effect of riboflavin under UV-B irradiation via miR-203/c-Jun signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.","abstract":"Riboflavin (RF) or vitamin B2 is known to have neuroprotective effects. In the present study, we report the attenuation of the neuroprotective effects of RF under UV-B irradiation. Preconditioning of UV-B irradiated riboflavin (UV-B-RF) showed attenuated neuroprotective effects compared to that of RF in SH-SY5Y neuroblostoma cell line and primary cortical neurons in vitro and a rat model of cerebral ischemia in vivo.Results indicated that RF pretreatment significantly inhibited cell death and reduced LDH secretion compared to that of the UV-B-RF pretreatment in primary cortical neuron cultures subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation in vitro and cortical brain tissue subjected to ischemic injury in vivo. Further mechanistic studies using cortical neuron cultures revealed that RF treatment induced increased miR-203 expression which in turn inhibited c-Jun expression and increased neuronal cell survival. Functional assays clearly demonstrated that the UV-B-RF preconditioning failed to sustain the increased expression of miR-203 and the decreased levels of c-Jun, mediating the neuroprotective effects of RF. UV-B irradiation attenuated the neuroprotective effects of RF through modulation of the miR-203/c-Jun signaling pathway.Thus, the ability of UV-B to serve as a modulator of this neuroprotective signaling pathway warrants further studies into its role as a regulator of other cytoprotective/neuroprotective signaling pathways.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884571","annotations":[{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.820679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Neuroprotection","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroprotection"},{"name":"Brain ischemia","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_ischemia"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.805308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.731169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.728931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.64932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Cerebrum","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Motor cortex","weight":0.413163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_cortex"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.345536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.249403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Y chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome"},{"name":"Reaction mechanism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_mechanism"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.0162412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"}]}
