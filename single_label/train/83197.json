{"id":83197,"title":"Chewing and swallowing in young women with temporomandibular disorder.","abstract":"To evaluate chewing and swallowing functions in women with and without temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and investigate the position of the mandible and the hyoid bone as they are important structures in the development of these functions.Seventy women were evaluated in relation to TMD diagnosis according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria, among them, 34 composed the study group (SG) with TMD and 36 took part in the control group (CG). Evaluation of the masticatory and swallowing functions was performed according to the Protocol of Orofacial Myofunctional Evaluation with Scores. Mandibular and hyoid bone position variables were measured by cephalometric analysis.TMD subjects showed a significant difference on tongue (p=0.03) and lip (p=0.04) posture during swallowing function, and a more frequent adoption of a chronic unilateral chewing pattern as well (p=0.03). Moreover, they presented a lower position of the hyoid bone in relation to the mandible (p=0,00).TMD presence resulted on a higher frequency of myofunctional alterations during masticatory and swallowing functions. A greater distance from hyoid bone to the mandible in addition with the presence of painful symptom can justify, partly, the atypical behaviors of the tongue and lips observed on TMD group. The TMD repercussion on alimentaires functions in a young age group justifies the importance of an earlier diagnosis and therapeutic intervention in these individuals.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413427","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.708582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.605826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Hyoid bone","weight":0.595374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid_bone"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.509714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint disorder","weight":0.363198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.349897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Swallowing","weight":0.25322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Human positions","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_positions"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Cephalometric analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometric_analysis"},{"name":"Research Diagnostic Criteria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Diagnostic_Criteria"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.0263827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Singapore","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Cephalometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry"},{"name":"Computer graphics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics"},{"name":"Scores New York (Gentlemen's club)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scores_New_York_(Gentlemen's_club)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Criteria (band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criteria_(band)"},{"name":"Repercussion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repercussion"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"}]}
