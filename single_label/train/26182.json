{"id":26182,"title":"Adoption of endovenous laser treatment as the primary treatment modality for varicose veins: the Auckland City Hospital experience.","abstract":"To assess the effectiveness of adopting endovenous laser treatment (EVLT) as the primary treatment modality for varicose veins at Auckland City Hospital (Auckland, New Zealand).The outcomes of 354 consecutive EVLT procedures performed between 2007 and 2013 were reviewed. Data was collected from a prospectively maintained procedural database and by retrospective chart review.Of the 319 patients who had an ultrasound, at 1 month post-procedure there was a saphenous vein occlusion rate of 96%. Side effects were minimal with no cases of DVT or skin burns and one case of self-limiting neuralgia. The procedure was well tolerated with a median pain score of 3. Since the adoption of EVLT there has been a large increase in the number of patients treated for varicose veins (28 in 2007 compared to 176 in 2013).EVLT is a safe and effective treatment for varicose veins and its adoption has allowed a large increase in the number of varicose vein patients treated at Auckland City Hospital.","date":"2014-08-22","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25145305","annotations":[{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.572364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.488645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Deep vein thrombosis","weight":0.443512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_vein_thrombosis"},{"name":"Varicose veins","weight":0.425643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicose_veins"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.352999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Auckland","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0418302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Auckland City","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_City"},{"name":"Neuralgia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralgia"},{"name":"Auckland City Hospital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_City_Hospital"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Endovenous laser treatment","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovenous_laser_treatment"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Procedural programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"354","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/354"},{"name":"319","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/319"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Second degree burn","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_degree_burn"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Great saphenous vein","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_saphenous_vein"}]}
