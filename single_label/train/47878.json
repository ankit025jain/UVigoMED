{"id":47878,"title":"Pegylated IFN-? regulates hepatic gene expression through transient Jak/STAT activation.","abstract":"The use of pegylated interferon-? (pegIFN-?) has replaced unmodified recombinant IFN-? for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis. While the superior antiviral efficacy of pegIFN-? is generally attributed to improved pharmacokinetic properties, the pharmacodynamic effects of pegIFN-? in the liver have not been studied. Here, we analyzed pegIFN-?-induced signaling and gene regulation in paired liver biopsies obtained prior to treatment and during the first week following pegIFN-? injection in 18 patients with chronic hepatitis C. Despite sustained high concentrations of pegIFN-? in serum, the Jak/STAT pathway was activated in hepatocytes only on the first day after pegIFN-? administration. Evaluation of liver biopsies revealed that pegIFN-? induces hundreds of genes that can be classified into four clusters based on different temporal expression profiles. In all clusters, gene transcription was mainly driven by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). Compared with conventional IFN-? therapy, pegIFN-? induced a broader spectrum of gene expression, including many genes involved in cellular immunity. IFN-induced secondary transcription factors did not result in additional waves of gene expression. Our data indicate that the superior antiviral efficacy of pegIFN-? is not the result of prolonged Jak/STAT pathway activation in hepatocytes, but rather is due to induction of additional genes that are involved in cellular immune responses.
