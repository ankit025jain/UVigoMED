{"id":38739,"title":"Chest pain and ventricular tachycardia in a patient with surgically corrected anomalous right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva.","abstract":"We present a case of an adult patient who had anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the left sinus of Valsalva that had been treated surgically in the past and who presented years later with chest pain and runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography showed a patent unroofed RCA with appropriately repositioned origin and no obstructive coronary artery disease. This case presents angiographic documentation of a technically satisfactory repair of anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery and suggests that potentially lethal arrhythmia can occur despite a technically satisfactory repair.
