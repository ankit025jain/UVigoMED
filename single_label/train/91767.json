{"id":91767,"title":"Notes from the field: rotavirus vaccine administration errors--United States, 2006-2013.","abstract":"Two live rotavirus oral vaccines, RotaTeq (RV5) (Merck & Co., Inc.) and Rotarix (RV1) (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), are approved for prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis and recommended at ages 2, 4 (RV5/RV1), and 6 (RV5) months by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Because most childhood vaccines are injectable, vaccination providers might have less experience administering oral vaccines. To assess that hypothesis, CDC searched for reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of rotavirus vaccine administration errors involving injection and eye splashes in the United States during the period January 1, 2006-August 1, 2013. A total of 66 reports were found.
