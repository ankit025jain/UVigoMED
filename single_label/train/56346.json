{"id":56346,"title":"Suicide and visual loss: a case report reflecting the need for recognition and management in ophthalmological settings.","abstract":"In the United States, 5.5 million people over the age of 40 meet criteria for visual impairment (VI). They often suffer significant psychosocial and health consequences, including reduced quality of life and depression, which can be persistent and difficult to treat. Additionally, VI may increase the risk of suicide. We report a case of a patient with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and suicidal ideation. While this link is reasonable, there are no prior cases of suicidality among patients with ARMD. Moreover, the literature is silent regarding proper approaches to diagnosing and managing suicidality among patients with VI, especially ARMD.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24702438","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.782794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Suicidal ideation","weight":0.770957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.651392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.651267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.445275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.371952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.208226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.191115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Macular degeneration","weight":0.062063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Silent film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"}]}
