{"id":91719,"title":"Correction of distal phalangeal nonunion using peg bone graft.","abstract":"To evaluate the outcome of a peg bone graft for treatment of distal phalangeal nonunion, in terms of safety and effectiveness.We performed grafts using bone pegs in 13 patients who reported pain and instability of the fingertip as a result of distal phalanx nonunion. Surgical procedures included harvesting cancellous and cortical bone from ilium, radius, or ulna. We made a small incision in the fingertip and placed the bone pegs through the canal created for this access. In a few cases in which the bone peg did not offer mechanical stability, we used K-wires for additional support.All patients had successful union of the distal phalanx without serious complications in either donor or recipient areas. Range of motion improved postoperatively. An additional operation was needed in 1 case.The use of a peg bone graft in the treatment of distal phalanx nonunion offers easy access to the nonunion area and allows for effortless internal fixation. The bone contact area was increased, resulting in bone union and stability. Therefore, bone peg graft could be considered a potential method for the treatment of distal phalanx nonunion.Therapeutic IV.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480685","annotations":[{"name":"Ulna","weight":0.795841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna"},{"name":"Ilium (bone)","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.707308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cancellous bone","weight":0.681011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.655603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bone grafting","weight":0.601443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_grafting"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.560642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.30333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.19543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Phalanx bone","weight":0.18738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Distal phalanges","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_phalanges"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"List of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Harvest","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Potential method","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_method"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Tuning peg","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuning_peg"}]}
