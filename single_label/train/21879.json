{"id":21879,"title":"Ceftaroline activity against organisms isolated from respiratory tract infections in USA hospitals: results from the AWARE Program, 2009-2011.","abstract":"The Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation Program monitors the activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against pathogens causing either respiratory or skin and soft tissue infections. A total of 7733 isolates from patients in 80 medical centers across the United States (USA) identified as respiratory tract pathogens by the infection type and/or specimen site recorded by the submitting laboratory during 2009-2011 were evaluated. There were 3360 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1799 Haemophilus influenzae, 1087 Staphylococcus aureus, 678 Moraxella catarrhalis, 459 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 223 Escherichia coli, and 127 Klebsiella oxytoca. Annual penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae ranged from 21.9 to 24.3%. All S. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at a ceftaroline MIC of ?0.5 ?g/mL with 100.0% of isolates categorized as susceptible. Ceftaroline was 16-fold more active than ceftriaxone and 32-fold more active than amoxicillin-clavulanate against penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Only 49.8% of the penicillin-resistant isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. There were a total of 1087 S. aureus (48.9% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) isolates, and the yearly MRSA rate ranged from 47.9 to 49.7%. The ceftaroline MIC50/90 for S. aureus was at 0.25/1 ?g/mL; 98.2% susceptible and no resistant strains (?4 ?g/mL). Ceftaroline activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 and 0.25 ?g/mL, respectively; 100% susceptible) was 2- to 4-fold greater than for MRSA (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 ?g/mL; 96.2% susceptible). The ceftriaxone MIC90 for MSSA was 4 ?g/mL. Ceftaroline was active against H. influenzae (MIC50/90 ?0.015/0.03 ?g/mL; 100.0% susceptible) and against M. catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 ?g/mL). Ceftaroline was active against non-extended spectrum ?-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype strains of Enterobacteriaceae but not against ESBL-positive phenotype strains. In summary, ceftaroline was highly active against a large collection of bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in the USA during 2009 through 2011.
