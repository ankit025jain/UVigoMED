{"id":2854,"title":"Topical cyclosporine a treatment in corneal refractive surgery and patients with dry eye.","abstract":"To evaluate preoperative and postoperative dry eye and the effect of cyclosporine A treatment in patients screened for corneal refractive surgery and treated with photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) or LASIK.A consecutive case series of 1,056 patients screened for corneal refractive surgery from 2007 to 2012 was retrospectively analyzed. The level of preoperative and postoperative dry eye and the responsiveness to topical cyclosporine A treatment were assessed.One eye of each patient was randomly selected. A total of 642 eyes progressed to surgery: 524 (81.6%) and 118 (18.4%) underwent LASIK and PRK, respectively. Of 81 (7.7%) diagnosed as having dry eye, 55 were deemed potential candidates and optimized for refractive surgery. Thirty-seven patients with moderate dry eye were treated with topical cyclosporine A prior to surgery (mean duration: 3.2 Â± 2.1 months; range: 1 to 12 months). After cyclosporine A treatment, 28 (75.7%) eyes underwent LASIK, 4 (10.8%) eyes underwent PRK, and 5 (13.5%) eyes were not operated on due to failed treatment of dry eye. Postoperative refractive surgery-induced neurotrophic epitheliopathy (LINE in LASIK) was noted in 132 (27.3%) and 12 (11.1%) eyes that underwent LASIK and PRK, respectively. Topical cyclosporine A was prescribed in 79 LASIK-induced and 3 PRK-induced dry eyes. After 12 months or more of cyclosporine A treatment, 5 (6.1%) eyes continued to have dry eye symptoms or signs.Topical cyclosporine A treatment is effective therapy for optimizing patients for refractive surgery and treatment of new onset or worsened dry eye after surgery.","date":"2014-10-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25325897","annotations":[{"name":"LASIK","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Photorefractive keratectomy","weight":0.84917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy"},{"name":"Refractive surgery","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_surgery"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.799132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Keratoconjunctivitis sicca","weight":0.616083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconjunctivitis_sicca"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.405245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.323741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"524","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/524"},{"name":"642","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/642"},{"name":"Program optimization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Responsiveness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsiveness"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Photorefractive effect","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_effect"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Retrotransposon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Neurotrophin","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotrophin"},{"name":"Uncial 056","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_056"}]}
