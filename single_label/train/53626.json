{"id":53626,"title":"Stress: from symptom to disease.","abstract":"To evaluate the presence and role of stress in causing diseases.We conducted a 6-month study in patients who presented for the first time with a series of symptom and tried to look for an organic cause of those symptoms. We wanted to see the impact of stress in everyday life and its role in causing various diseases.The obtained results showed a female predominance in terms of seeking medical advice and that the most affected age group was 20-30 years, accounted for by the start of socio-professional issues. The psycho-behavioural symptoms were the most prevalent, followed by the gastro-intestinal ones. The presence of stress had left its mark on these events, fact proven by the lower rate of organic pathology.Stress awareness must guide us in medical practice as to avoid under- or over-diagnosis.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505895","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.687788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.557647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Overdiagnosis","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdiagnosis"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.154683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Personal life","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_life"},{"name":"2030","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2030"},{"name":"Confidence trick","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick"},{"name":"Demographic profile","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_profile"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
