{"id":34664,"title":"[Double bilateral talocalcaneal and calcaneonavicular coalition in a 15 year-old patient: treatment and results].","abstract":"We report the case of a male, 15 year-old patient without any remarkable pathologic history, with double talocalcaneal and calcaneonavicular coalition in both feet. He underwent surgery of the left foot due to onset of refractory symptoms after conservative treatment.Both coalitions were resected and pedal muscle was interposed at the level of the calcaneonavicular joint as well as an endorthesis in the tarsal sinus. The patient became totally asymptomatic after surgery.Multiple bilateral tarsal coalitions, i.e., present in both feet, are very infrequent, except when they are associated with syndromic pictures or conditions such as fibular hemimelus, Alpert syndrome, Nievergelt-Pearlman syndrome, multiple synostosis or hereditary symphalangism. Treatment should be individualized based on the location of the synostosis.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716370","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.658496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.592681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.579766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Synostosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synostosis"},{"name":"Lever","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever"},{"name":"Coalition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Subtalar joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtalar_joint"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"},{"name":"Tarsus (skeleton)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)"},{"name":"Fibula","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"}]}
