{"id":34206,"title":"A novel elastin gene mutation in a Vietnamese patient with cutis laxa.","abstract":"We report a 3-year-old girl from Vietnam with severe congenital cutis laxa; no cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurologic, or visceral involvement; and no family history of cutis laxa. Mutational analysis of the elastin gene identified heterozygosity for a previously unreported de novo c.2184delT mutation in exon 30 not present in either parent.
