{"id":12611,"title":"Gastroprotective effect of Cochinchina momordica seed extract in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced acute gastric damage in a rat model.","abstract":"The major compounds of Cochinchina momordica seed extract (SK-MS10) include momordica saponins. We report that the gastroprotective effect of SK-MS10 in an ethanol-induced gastric damage rat model is mediated by suppressing proinflammatory cytokines and downregulating cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and the activation of calcitonin gene-related peptide. In this study, we evaluated the gastroprotective effects of SK-MS10 in the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric damage rat model.The pretreatment effect of SK-MS10 was evaluated in the NSAID-induced gastric damage rat model using aspirin, indomethacin, and diclofenac in 7-week-old rats. Gastric damage was evaluated based on the gross ulcer index by gastroenterologists, and the damage area (%) was measured using the MetaMorph 7.0 video image analysis system. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blotting was used to analyze the levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, COX-2, cPLA2, and 5-LOX.All NSAIDs induced gastric damage based on the gross ulcer index and damage area (p<0.05). Gastric damage was significantly attenuated by SK-MS10 pretreatment compared with NSAID treatment alone (p<0.05). The SK-MS10 pretreatment group exhibited lower MPO levels than the diclofenac group. The expression of cPLA2 and 5-LOX was decreased by SK-MS10 pretreatment in each of the three NSAID treatment groups.SK-MS10 exhibited a gastroprotective effect against NSAID-induced acute gastric damage in rats. However, its protective mechanism may be different across the three types of NSAID-induced gastric damage models in rats.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24516701","annotations":[{"name":"Indometacin","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin"},{"name":"Diclofenac","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac"},{"name":"Cyclooxygenase","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Calcitonin","weight":0.839523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin"},{"name":"Phospholipase A2","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase_A2"},{"name":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.782785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Lipoxygenase","weight":0.752864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoxygenase"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Cytosol","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.716565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","weight":0.651122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenterology"},{"name":"Myeloperoxidase","weight":0.639916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloperoxidase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.626216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.604677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.453863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.237453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.23498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Saponin","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saponin"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Seed","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
