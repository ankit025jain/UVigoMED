{"id":89455,"title":"Iatrogenic nerve injuries in common upper extremity procedures.","abstract":"Iatrogenic nerve injuries frequently occur during procedures around the hand and wrist, although they are not always recognized at the time of injury or in the immediate postoperative period. Because preventing injuries is of paramount importance, extensive knowledge of the anatomy of the at-risk nerves is critical. Best results occur after immediate repair because a substantial delay before secondary surgery diminishes the chances for recovery from motor or sensory nerve dysfunction and relief from pain. It is helpful to review iatrogenic nerve injuries associated with common hand surgical procedures.
