{"id":91400,"title":"Proton-pump inhibitor use and hip fractures in men: a population-based case-control study.","abstract":"To estimate the association between proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use and hip fracture.We conducted a case-control study of 6774 pairs of men aged 45Â years or older, matched on age, race, and medical center. Cases sustained incident hip fractures in 1997-2006. Fracture date was index date for each case-control pair. PPI exposure was identified from electronic pharmacy records, 1991-2006. PPI use was measured as (1) ever versus never; (2) adherence; (3) duration; and (4) recentness. Omeprazole and pantoprazole were analyzed separately using conditional logistic regression, adjusted for comorbidities. Nonusers were the referent group.Eight hundred ninety-six (13.2%) cases and 713 (10.5%) controls used omeprazole before index date (matched odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.27). Greatest adherence (medication possession ratio > 80%) (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.09-1.62), highest tertile of duration (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.48), and recent use (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.47) were associated with hip fracture. Six hundred ninety-four (10.2%) cases and 576 (8.5%) controls had used pantoprazole (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.97-1.24). Longest duration (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.53) and most recent use (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.71) were associated with hip fracture. Our study suggests that PPI use and hip fractures are associated, with risk increasing with longer duration and more recent use.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507954","annotations":[{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.494375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.457819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.275698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Pharmacy","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Omeprazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omeprazole"},{"name":"Pantoprazole","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantoprazole"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Reference group","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_group"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0179568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Proton-pump inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor"},{"name":"576","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576"},{"name":"971","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/971"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"10.2","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.2"},{"name":"Index (publishing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(publishing)"},{"name":"List of The Muppet Show episodes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Muppet_Show_episodes"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Race (classification of humans)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Pair skating","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_skating"},{"name":"Reference","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference"},{"name":"Conditional probability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability"},{"name":"Quantile","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile"}]}
