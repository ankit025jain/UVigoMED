{"id":78956,"title":"Digital processing technology for bone-anchored hearing aids: randomised comparison of two devices in hearing aid users with mixed or conductive hearing loss.","abstract":"This study compared the performance of two new bone-anchored hearing aids with older bone-anchored hearing aids that were not fully digital.Fourteen experienced bone-anchored hearing aid users participated in this cross-over study. Performance of their existing bone-anchored hearing aid was assessed using speech-in-noise testing and questionnaires. Participants were then fitted with either a Ponto Pro or a BP100 device. After four weeks of use with each new device, the same assessments were repeated.Speech-in-noise testing for the 50 per cent signal-to-noise ratio (the ratio at which 50 per cent of responses were correct) showed no significant differences between the Ponto Pro and the BP100 devices (p = 0.1) However, both devices showed significant improvement compared with the participants' previous bone-anchored hearing aid devices (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the two new devices in the questionnaire data.Both fully digital bone-anchored hearing aids demonstrated superior speech processing compared with the previous generation of devices. There were no substantial differences between the two digital devices in either objective or subjective tests.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524414","annotations":[{"name":"Technology","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.446926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.375564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Speech processing","weight":0.362845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_processing"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.161645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.152239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Electrical conductor","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"},{"name":"Conductive hearing loss","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Crossover study","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_study"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Pontus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"History of video game consoles (third generation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(third_generation)"},{"name":"Comparison of American and Canadian football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_Canadian_football"},{"name":"Subjective video quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_video_quality"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Audio crossover","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_crossover"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"List of industrial processes","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_industrial_processes"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Audio engineering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineering"}]}
