{"id":85863,"title":"Comprehensive assessment of the association between XPD rs13181 polymorphism and lung cancer risk.","abstract":"Xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) rs13181 may reduce DNA repair capacity (DRC) through modifying XPD protein product. Reduced DRC is reportedly related to an increase in the risk of lung cancer. To precisely estimate the association between XPD rs13181 and lung cancer risk, we carried out the current meta-analysis. We searched multiple databases (up to 31 October 2013) for studies investigating the association of XPD rs13181 and lung cancer. Odds ratio (OR) was estimated with the fixed effect model to assess the association. Heterogeneity between studies was measured using Q test. Subgroup analyses were conducted by ethnicity, histological type, and sample size. Meta-analysis of 30 studies suggested that individuals carrying Gln/Gln genotype were more likely than the individuals with Lys/Lys or Lys/Gln + Lys/Lys genotypes (homozygous model, OR 1.18, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.31; recessive model, OR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.06-1.29) to develop lung cancer, without any substantial heterogeneity. This significantly increased risk was also revealed in the individuals harboring Gln/Gln + Lys/Gln genotypes (dominant model, OR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.01-1.12). Further stratification by histological type, ethnicity, and sample size yielded statistically significant estimates in subgroup of Caucasian subjects, non-small cell lung cancer, and relatively large studies, but borderline association in Asians. Our analyses demonstrate that XPD rs13181 may be associated with an increase in the risk of lung cancer among Caucasian populations.","date":"2014-09-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845027","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.84026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.826513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.791887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Homozygous","weight":0.789243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homozygous"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.762887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.756407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.743002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.734227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.729384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.64796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.530165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.502995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.343467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Xeroderma pigmentosum","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeroderma_pigmentosum"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.219542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.214907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Asian people","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_people"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Fixed effects model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
