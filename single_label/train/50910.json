{"id":50910,"title":"Body composition is improved during 12 months' treatment with metformin alone or combined with oral contraceptives compared with treatment with oral contraceptives in polycystic ovary syndrome.","abstract":"Central obesity in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased inflammatory markers and increased risk for type 2 diabetes.The objective of the study was to evaluate whether treatment with metformin (M) or M combined with oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) resulted in a more advantageous body composition than treatment with OCP alone.The study was conducted at an outpatient clinic.This was a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Ninety patients with PCOS were randomized to 12 months' treatment with M (2 g/d), M + OCP (150 mg desogestrel+30 ?g ethinylestradiol), or OCP. Whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans and clinical and hormonal evaluations were performed before and after the intervention period. A total of 65 of 90 patients completed the study.Changes in weight at 6 and 12 months and changes in regional fat mass estimates at 12 months were measured.Dropout rates between intervention groups were not significantly different. Treatment with M and M+OCP were superior to OCP regarding weight and regional fat mass. The median (quartiles) weight changes during 12 months of M, M+OCP, and OCP treatment were -3.0 (-10.3; 0.6), -1.9 (-4.9; 0.1), and 1.2 (-0.8; 3.0) kg, respectively, P < .05. Upper to lower fat mass ratio was unchanged. Changes in body composition were predicted by the type of medical intervention (M, M+OCP, or OCP) and not by body mass index at study inclusion. OCP and M+OCP were superior to M regarding reduction in free T levels.M treatment alone or in combination with OCP was associated with weight loss and improved body composition compared with OCP, whereas free T levels decreased during M+OCP or OCP. Combined treatment with M+OCP should be considered as an alternative to treatment with OCP alone to avoid weight gain in PCOS.","date":"2014-07-09","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742124","annotations":[{"name":"Abdominal obesity","weight":0.936387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.862063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.846453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.825112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.812688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Combined oral contraceptive pill","weight":0.708543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Weight gain","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.646739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.19681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.165507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Body composition","weight":0.156982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Ethinylestradiol","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethinylestradiol"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Desogestrel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desogestrel"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Quartile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Dropping out","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_out"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
