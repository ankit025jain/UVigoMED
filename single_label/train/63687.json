{"id":63687,"title":"Clinical significance of abnormal serum free light chain ratio: diagnostic confusion or underlying monoclonality?","abstract":"The spectrum of laboratory tests used to detect monoclonal components (M-components) include serum and urine protein electrophoresis (PEP), immunofixation electrophoresis, and immunonephelometric methods such as free light chain assay (sFLC).In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 78 patients who were to be tested with FLC without previous evidence of MG in order to investigate the clinical meaning of K/L screening. Abnormal K/L in sFLC was found in 25 samples from 21 patients (21/78, 26.92%).Among them, serum electrophoresis was requested for 16 patients where 5 were diagnosed as either normal or polyclonal gammopathy, 5 as plasma cell myeloma, 5 as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and I as amyloidosis. In total, 11 patients were revealed to have MG related diseases (11/25, 44.0 %).The clinical function of sFLC as a MG screening tool turned out to be effective based on the result where 16 out of 21 patients who were subject to further study led to diagnoses of MG related diseases in 11 patients. To provide an accurate evaluation for the performance of sFLC as a screening tool for MG, further studies should include additional confirmation of PEP results for patient groups that showed normal K/L ratios.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24409680","annotations":[{"name":"Plasma cell","weight":0.898415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_cell"},{"name":"Amyloidosis","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.707851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Electrophoresis","weight":0.694462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.464342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Protein electrophoresis","weight":0.308914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy","weight":0.302918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.296587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Mental confusion","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_confusion"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance","weight":0.268791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy_of_undetermined_significance"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.258979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Serum protein electrophoresis","weight":0.197756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_protein_electrophoresis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.147966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.125165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Abnormality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior)"}]}
