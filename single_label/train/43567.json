{"id":43567,"title":"A single surgeon's series of transthoracic oesophageal resections.","abstract":"Significant controversy persists over the optimum surgical management of oesophageal carcinoma. The authors report on a consecutive personal series of open transthoracic oesophageal resections.Data relating to resections performed between mid-1993 and the end of 2010 were analysed. Patient and tumour assessment evolved over this period. Preoperative chemotherapy in appropriate cases was introduced in 2002. A laparotomy and right lateral thoracotomy approach (Ivor-Lewis) was used. In all cases the pylorus was not interfered with, no attempt was made to perform a radical lymphadenectomy but surgical strategy was focused on producing an R0 resection and a hand sewn anastomosis was fashioned.A total of 165 resections were performed; 130 patients (80%) were male. The median age was 66 years (range: 31-82 years). Eighty per cent had an adenocarcinoma. Sixty-four per cent of the tumours were T3/T4 and sixty-two per cent node positive. Forty patients (24%) had an involved circumferential resection margin (CRM). Five patients (3.0%) had no resection and a quarter (26%) developed morbidity of some form. There was one clinical anastomotic leak (0.6%) and three benign strictures requiring dilation (1.8%). In-hospital mortality was 3.0% (5 patients). Disease specific survival at one, two and five years was 77%, 42% and 36% respectively. Neither CRM involvement nor preoperative chemotherapy influenced survival significantly. No patient required intervention to disrupt the pylorus.Excellent outcomes are achievable following open transthoracic oesophagectomy without radical lymphadenectomy using a hand sewn gastro-oesophageal anastomosis and without disrupting the pylorus.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780676","annotations":[{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Thoracotomy","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracotomy"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.714458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.562623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.539362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.451315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Resection margin","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resection_margin"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.415029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.372025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.353305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pylorus","weight":0.14359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
