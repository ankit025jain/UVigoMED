{"id":76738,"title":"Adipose tissue changes in obesity and the impact on metabolic function.","abstract":"Obesity is associated with adverse alterations in adipose tissue that predispose to metabolic dysregulation. These adverse alterations include accumulation of inflammatory macrophages leading to the activation of inflammation pathways, reduction in lipid turnover, and deposition of fat in ectopic locations. These alterations are precursors to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.
