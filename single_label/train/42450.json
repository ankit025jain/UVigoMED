{"id":42450,"title":"Risk of development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NASH-related cirrhosis.","abstract":"The risk of development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is well established and is being recognized increasingly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis. This study aimed to assess the risk of development of HCC in patients with NASH-related cirrhosis.From January 2010 to October 2011, we prospectively enrolled 585 patients with liver cirrhosis (men:women ratio 4.4:1, mean age 50.1 +/- 6.1 years, aetiology HBV 19%, HCV 14.2%, NASH-related 7%, cryptogenic cirrhosis 17.8%, already diagnosed cirrhosis 48.2%, and the remaining were newly diagnosed cases). The cumulative follow-up was for 5.9 +/- 0.5, 6.1 + 0.8 and 6.8 + 1.2 years for HBV, HCV and NASH-related cirrhosis, respectively. Patients with advanced cirrhosis, Child class C and associated comorbid conditions where survival was < 1 year were excluded from the study. The remaining patients were followed up 6-monthly with ultrasound examination and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test. Patients suspected of HCC underwent triple-phase computed tomography (CT) scan and liver biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis.A total of 54 patients developed HCC, of which 26 had HBV, 14 had HCV, 9 had- cryptogenic and 6 had- NASH-related cirrhosis. The annual rate of development of HCC was 1.5%, 3.6%, 0.6% and 0.46 in HBV, HCV, cryptogenic and NASH-related cirrhosis, respectively.The incidence of HCC was highest in HCV and lowest in NASH-related cirrhosis. These figures suggest an intermediate risk of development of HCC when compared to western countries and Japan.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851525","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.790996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.659091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.474803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.467494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.328623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.314341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.183077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"Steatohepatitis","weight":0.0922222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatohepatitis"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.0698847,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
