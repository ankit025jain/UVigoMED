{"id":91081,"title":"Application of the sit-to-stand movement for the early assessment of functional deficits in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.","abstract":"The aims of this study were to identify and quantify functional deficits between the involved and the uninvolved limb as early as 1 mo after ACL reconstruction by means of a sit-to-stand movement on two force platforms.Ground reaction forces were measured in 73 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction, 47 with patellar tendon autograft and 26 with hamstring tendon autograft (ACL-H), and in 22 controls, who stood up from a seat as fast as possible. Side-to-side limb symmetry index (LSI) was calculated for peak force and rate of force development.The LSI of vertical peak force was 59% in the patellar tendon autograft group and 68% in the ACL-H group, which were both lower than the 95% LSI of the controls (P < 0.001). The LSI of rate of force development was 27% in the patellar tendon autograft group and 48% in the ACL-H group, which were both lower than the 97% LSI of the controls (P < 0.001). After 2 mos, only in the ACL-H group, the LSI of both vertical peak force and rate of force development reached 88% and 80%, respectively, thus approaching the 96% and 92% LSI of the controls.Sit-to-stand is effective for measuring functional deficits as early as 1 mo after ACL reconstruction. After 2 mos from surgery, the ACL-H group but not the patellar tendon autograft group approached the LSI of the control group, which may be attributed to differences in the graft.","date":"2014-02-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553423","annotations":[{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.744072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Patellar ligament","weight":0.735552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_ligament"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.660797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Hamstring","weight":0.209004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.169585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.114038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.01992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Railway platform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_platform"},{"name":"Chair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Reaction (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_(physics)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","weight":0.0154274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_reconstruction"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"}]}
