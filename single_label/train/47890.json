{"id":47890,"title":"[Application of combined esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring in infants and children with gastroesophageal reflux disease].","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of a 24-hour esophageal combined multichannel intraluminal impedance pH (24?h our MII-pH) monitoring in children with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease and recurrent pneumonia.A total of 17 cases with a suspected diagnosis of GER disease children with unexplained recurrent pneumonia underwent a 24-hour MII-pH monitoring to analysis of the nature and characteristics of reflux.In the 17 cases of GER disease with recurrent pneumonia, 11 (65%) were confirmed positively by a 24-hours of MII-pH monitoring. A total of 853 reflux cycle were detected, of which 65.3% were acid refluxes predominantly occurring within 2 hours after meal, and 71.6% were mixed refluxes. Refluxes occurred most frequently in the supine position, followed by the lateral position and the prone position. Distal reflux was the predominant form of reflux. According to the Biox-Ochoa classification, 73% of cases (8/11) were severe GER.MII-pH monitoring may effectively characterize refluxate properties and thereby increase the detection rate of GER disease.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568912","annotations":[{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.819392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.778583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Supine position","weight":0.47891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supine_position"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.419028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.327118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.324057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.225223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.118728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Electrical impedance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Prone position","weight":0.0263451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prone_position"},{"name":"811","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/811"},{"name":"853","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/853"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Flour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Planck constant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
