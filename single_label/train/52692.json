{"id":52692,"title":"Effect of Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) on fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in alloxan induced diabetic rabbits.","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is a major threat to present and future generations. The role of herbal medication has emerged as a safe alternative to currently available medication due to its decreased potential to produce side effects, hence effect of Carthamus tinctorius was observed on fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in alloxan induced diabetic rabbits. Thirty five healthy male rabbits were divided into 5 groups with 7 rabbits in each (Normal control, diabetic control, diabetic treated with glibenclamide, diabetic treated with Carthamus tinctorius extract at doses of 200 and 300mg/kg of body weight). Drug and extract were given orally for 30 days and the values for blood glucose levels were observed after 15(th) and 30(th) day of treatment by using standard reagent kits provided by Human Germany. While insulin levels were checked at the end of the study by using Architect i1000 by Abbott Diagnostics USA. Animals were also observed for any gross toxicity during the study. Results revealed that Carthamus tinctorius has significant hypoglycemic effect at 200mg/kg and 300mg/kg doses as compared to diabetic control group. Insulin levels were significantly increased in Glibenclamide treated as well as Carthamus tinctorius treated groups as compared to diabetic control.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577929","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Glibenclamide","weight":0.670417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibenclamide"},{"name":"Herbal","weight":0.419784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.392032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Safflower","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safflower"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.224882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Reagent","weight":0.197026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagent"},{"name":"Abbott Laboratories","weight":0.0656404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.0512665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Alloxan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloxan"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Architect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"}]}
