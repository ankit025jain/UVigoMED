{"id":22742,"title":"[Pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in children hospitalized in a critical care unit].","abstract":"Monitoring PK/PD of vancomycin with basal and peak serum levels and the area under the curve of drug exposure 24 h/MIC (ABC 24 h/MIC) could optimize the management of children.To study the PK of vancomycin in children hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), assessing PK/PD parameters withABC24 h/MIC.Retrospective, descriptive study in the PICU (Hospital Luis Calvo Mackenna) between January 2008-March 2010. We included children < 18 years who required antimicrobial treatment with vancomycin for suspected/confirmed staphylococcal infection using a dose of 40 mg/k/day. Plasmatic levels were performed one hour postinfusion and 30 min prior to the next dose. The following PK/PD parameters were calculated: vancomycin clearance, elimination rate constant, volume of distribution, half-life (T1/2) and ABC 24 h/ MIC.We enrolled eighty-four children. According to ABC 24 h/MIC obtained, 54% (45/84) of children reached an optimal level (> 400 mg*hr/L). Based on the traditional PK/PD parameters, 49% of cases (41/84) presented a basal level of vancomycin in the therapeutic range (5-15 ?g/mL) and of those, only 39% (16/41) had a ABC 24 h/MIC over 400 mg*h/L.Based on our results, children admitted to PICU could be exposed to sub therapeutic doses of vancomycin. We recommend to implement tailored antimicrobial treatment monitoring vancomycin PK/PD parameters.","date":"2014-02-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522298","annotations":[{"name":"Vancomycin","weight":0.862393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.844587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.781123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapeutic index","weight":0.746321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"},{"name":"Volume of distribution","weight":0.661552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_distribution"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.605498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.597539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.592735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.542361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.377849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.196462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.147145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0919796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"American Broadcasting Company","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company"},{"name":"Reaction rate constant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_rate_constant"},{"name":"Staphylococcal infection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcal_infection"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"1641","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1641"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"T-12 Cloudmaker","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-12_Cloudmaker"},{"name":"Distribution (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Juan Mackenna","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Mackenna"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Pediatric intensive care unit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Luis Calvo","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Calvo"}]}
