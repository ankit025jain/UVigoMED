{"id":69376,"title":"Endoscopic correction of complex cases of vesicoureteral reflux utilizing Vantris as a new non-biodegradable tissue-augmenting substance.","abstract":"We aimed to evaluate prospectively the efficacy of Vantris as a new non-biodegradable tissue-augmenting substance in children with complex cases of VUR.Over the last 4 years, 37 children (28 female and 9 male) with a mean age of 5.8 ± 3.1 years (mean ± SD) underwent endoscopic correction of complex VUR. A total of 38 renal refluxing units (RRU) was treated as 5 had persistent reflux after open surgery, 16 had duplication, 4 had Hutch diverticulum, 6 had small poorly functioning kidneys (less than 20% of relative renal function) with grade V VUR, 2 had ureterocele after puncture, 3 had persistent stump reflux, 1 had prune belly syndrome, and 1 had urogenital sinus. VUR was Grade I in 2, Grade II in 9, Grade III in 11, Grade IV in 10, and Grade V in 6 RRU, respectively.The reflux was corrected in 34 (89.4%) RRU after a single injection, after second injection in 2 (5.3%) RRU. In 2 (5.3%) RRU, VUR downgraded to Grade I (1RRU) and Grade II (1RRU) and they were taken off antibiotic prophylaxis. VCUG was performed in 11 (73.3%) of 15 children who completed 1 year and in 3 (33.3%) of 9 who completed 3 years of follow up as a part of the routine protocol. None showed VUR recurrence. US demonstrated normal appearance of kidneys in all patients.Our data show that Vantris injection provides a high level of reflux resolution in complex cases of VUR.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448911","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.654771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.530369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.521206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.48145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Vesicoureteral reflux","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicoureteral_reflux"},{"name":"Diverticulum","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulum"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.330397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.255984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.170177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Definitive urogenital sinus","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitive_urogenital_sinus"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Prune","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prune"},{"name":"Prune belly syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prune_belly_syndrome"},{"name":"Ureterocele","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureterocele"},{"name":"Graded stakes race","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.0226131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Grade (climbing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"International Scale of River Difficulty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
