{"id":90730,"title":"Modern retrograde intramedullary nails versus periarticular locked plates for supracondylar femur fractures after total knee arthroplasty.","abstract":"This study purpose is to analyze outcomes of modern intramedullary (IM) nails with a locked distal screw versus periarticular locking plates for peri-prosthetic supracondylar femur fractures in TKA. Ninety-five consecutive fractures in 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Fixation included 29 knees with a retrograde IM nail and 66 periarticular locked plates. Six patients died and 4 were lost to follow-up. There were 2 (9%) nonunions in the IM nail group and 12 non-unions/delayed-unions (19%) in the locked plate group (P = 0.34). A mean of 5.0 distal screws was used in locked plates versus 3.8 distal screws in the IM nails (P < 0.001). Despite a greater quantity of screws in the distal fragment, the failure rate of locked plating was twice that of IM nail fixation.","date":"2014-06-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581897","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.309333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Medullary cavity","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0492338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0357009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"TKA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKA"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.0180608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Plating","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plating"},{"name":"Failure rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
