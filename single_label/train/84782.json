{"id":84782,"title":"SnapShot: Necroptosis.","abstract":"Regulated necrosis, termed necroptosis, is mediated by the kinase activity of RIPK1 and RIPK3. It has distinct cellular features that are different than apoptosis. Necroptosis can be triggered by extracellular stimuli known to activate inflammation and cell death and its intracellular signaling pathway involves necrosome formation and MLKL activation. Inhibition of necroptosis has been shown to mitigate pathology in numerous mouse models, providing potential strategies to treat human diseases.
