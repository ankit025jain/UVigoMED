{"id":23591,"title":"Diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection by use of PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.","abstract":"We compared PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS) to culture using sonicate fluid from 431 subjects with explanted knee (n = 270) or hip (n = 161) prostheses. Of these, 152 and 279 subjects had prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and aseptic failure, respectively. The sensitivities for detecting PJI were 77.6% for PCR-ESI/MS and 69.7% for culture (P = 0.0105). The specificities were 93.5 and 99.3%, respectively (P = 0.0002).","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478503","annotations":[{"name":"Infection","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.599321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.375382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.230397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Septic arthritis","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_arthritis"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.159055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Asepsis","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asepsis"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.0700834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"431","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/431"},{"name":"270","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/270"},{"name":"Uncial 0105","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0105"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
