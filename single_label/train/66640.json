{"id":66640,"title":"Androgens involvement in the pathogenesis of renal stones formation.","abstract":"The potential role for the gonadal steroids in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis, higher mean of plasma oxalate concentration and kidney calcium oxalate deposition influenced by androgens in men has been proposed. In this study, the serum levels of steroid hormones as a pathogenesis of this condition in male patients with active renal stone disease compared with controls was investigated.Forty patients diagnosed with renal stones and hospitalized for further clinical treatments or referred to our office after ultrasonographic evaluations participated in the study. Forty six healthy subjects served as controls. Steroid sex hormones in the plasma samples including testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin were analyzed.A significant difference was observed between patients and the control subjects regarding serum testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin.Based on the results, a higher androgens level was diagnosed in renal stone patients, indicating a possibility of a substantial pathogenic role of testosterone, free testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone involvement in the pathogenesis of renal stones formation. Therefore, data presentation and further investigation on the relation between male steroids and urolithiasis is of importance and should be considered in evaluation of the etiology of the disease.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695421","annotations":[{"name":"Sex hormone-binding globulin","weight":0.916951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin"},{"name":"Dihydrotestosterone","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Sex steroid","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_steroid"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Gonad","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonad"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Steroid hormone","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_hormone"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.73151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.680973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.664494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.62732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.592122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.376722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Oxalic acid","weight":0.113571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalic_acid"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Oxalate","weight":0.0400013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalate"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"}]}
