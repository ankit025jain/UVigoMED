{"id":47076,"title":"Clinicopathological and p53 gene alteration comparison between young and older patients with gastric cancer.","abstract":"Differences in clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer (GC) between young and older patients are controversial and a matter of debate. Determining the statistical significance of clinicopathological information with respect to age might provide clues for better management and treatment of GC.A total of 103 Indian GC patients were enrolled for study and specimens were classified according to the AJCC-TNM system. Patients were grouped into two age-wise categories, young patients (<40 years; n=13) and older patients (?40 years, n=90). The clinicopathological features of both groups were retrospectively examined and compared. p53 alterations were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism and immunohistochemistry methods at gene and protein levels respectively. The cases were considered p53 over-expressed if it was present in more than 25% of the tumor cells and p53 alterations was correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients as well as etiological factors for GC in both groups.We found significant association of young patients with cancer stage (p=0.01), and very strong association with histology grade (p=0.064) and poorly differentiated (p=0.051) state of GC. However, neither young nor elderly patients showed associations with location, gender, etiological factors and p53 expression and alteration. Overall the male-to-female ratio of GC patients was 3.12 and the value was higher in the young (5.5) than in the older group (2.91).Clinicopathological features of GC like cancer stage, cell differentiation and histological grades were significantly different among young and old age cohorts. We observed a male predominance among the young group that decreased significantly with advancing age. More awareness of GC onset is required to detect cancer at an early stage for successful treatment.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606468","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.859089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.82565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.810987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.722587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.603867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.551315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.469411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.445331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.437007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.368792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.265779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Protein structure","weight":0.175612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0340852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"}]}
