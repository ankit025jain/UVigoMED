{"id":47092,"title":"The use of pharmacological prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in hospitalised patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.","abstract":"Hospitalised patients with inflammatory bowel disease are 1.5- to 3.5-fold more likely to develop venous thromboembolism compared to controls. Clinical guidelines recommend pharmacological prophylaxis.To determine the rate of pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis prescription and administration in a cohort of hospitalised patients with severe active ulcerative colitis and to assess predictors of failure to order pharmacological prophylaxis at 24 h.This is a retrospective review of hospitalised patients with severe active ulcerative colitis, identified by ICD-9-CM discharge code 556.x, admitted to a single tertiary care hospital from 1 January 2005 to 31 August 2012. Adequate thromboembolism prophylaxis was defined as an order for low-dose unfractionated heparin two to three times daily, low-molecular weight heparin 40 mg daily or fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily ordered and administered for >80% of the admission. Patient related factors associated with failure to order prophylaxis at 24 h were accessed as secondary outcomes.Three hundred and thirty-six patients were hospitalised with severe active ulcerative colitis. Hospitalists had prescribed appropriate pharmacological prophylaxis by 48 h in only 37% of cases. Of these, nurses administered all prescribed doses in 18% of cases. Only 7% of patients (22/304, 95% CI: 5-11%) received adequate pharmacological prophylaxis for >80% of their hospitalisation. Hematochezia (P = 0.002), elevated platelets (P = 0.008), male gender coupled with younger age (P = 0.005) and admission on a biologic (P = 0.03) were associated with failure to order prophylaxis.Hospitalised patients admitted with severe active ulcerative colitis are not receiving appropriate pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605866","annotations":[{"name":"Inflammatory bowel disease","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.742603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.739721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.682664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.666821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Fondaparinux","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondaparinux"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.401224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems","weight":0.300489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Statistical_Classification_of_Diseases_and_Related_Health_Problems"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.257481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Hospitalization","weight":0.0479091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalization"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Hematochezia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematochezia"},{"name":"Hospital medicine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_medicine"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"}]}
