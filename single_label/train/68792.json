{"id":68792,"title":"Single incision retro-peritoneoscopic paediatric nephrectomy: early experience.","abstract":"Single incision, single port, or single site surgery for retro-peritoneoscopic nephrectomy and nephro-ureterectomy in paediatric practice using an advanced access platform (GelPOINT Mini) is described in two patients. One patient had bilateral synchronous nephrectomy. The technique, advantages, and challenges are reported. Beyond the initial hurdles and learning curve, this technique is promising and has the potential to be extended to other procedures in paediatric urology.
