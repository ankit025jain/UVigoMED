{"id":55524,"title":"[Hybrid phacoemulsification: a new stage in the improvement of cataract surgery (?)].","abstract":"To evaluate the early results of femtosecond laser application in phacoemulsification of cataracts of different density.Femtosecond laser-assisted phacoemulsification cataract surgery was performed on 277 patients (390 surgeries) with II-IV degree lens nuclear density.The use of femtosecond laser for capsulorexis and lens nucleus fragmentation enables forming of a well-shaped, properly sized, and accurately centered aperture in the anterior lens capsule, reduces the equivalent time of ultrasound exposure (by 30% in average) and decreases the total time of nuclear fragments emulsification by a third.Femtosecond laser-assisted phacoemulsification is a highly effective and safe surgical technique that takes the surgery to a new level. By analogy with cardiovascular surgery this direction of improvement of cataract treatmentmay be called \"hybrid phacoemulsification\". Hybrid approach in cardiovascular surgery is promising and progressive. It combines the possibilities of conventional and minimal invasive endovascular surgery, considerably reducing intraoperative trauma during open-heart procedures. In cataract surgery the use of femtosecond laser in combination with classical ultrasound phacoemulsification enables closed-eye performance of certain technical stages that are usually fraught with complications.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24864492","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.634959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Cardiac surgery","weight":0.536562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.395744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.385176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Cell nucleus","weight":0.271803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.242562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.210938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.203754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Aperture","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture"},{"name":"Femtosecond","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtosecond"},{"name":"Mode-locking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode-locking"},{"name":"Capsule of lens","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_of_lens"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Nuclear weapon","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"277","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/277"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Classical antiquity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Analogy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy"}]}
