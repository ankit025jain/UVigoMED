{"id":42640,"title":"Role of Bax/Bcl-2 family members in green tea polyphenol induced necroptosis of p53-deficient Hep3B cells.","abstract":"Green tea polyphenol (GTP) is one of the most promising chemopreventive agent for cancer; it can inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through p53-dependent cell signaling pathways. Unfortunately, many tumor cells lack the functional p53, and little is known about the effect of GTP on the p53-deficient/mutant cancer cells. To understand the p53-independent mechanisms in GTP-treated p53-dificient/mutant cancer cells, we have now examined GTP-induced cytotoxicity in human hepatoma Hep3B cells (p53-deficient). The results showed that GTP could induce Bax and Bak activation, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and necroptosis of Hep3B cells. Bax and Bak, two key molecules of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), were interdependently activated by GTP, with translocation and homo-oligomerization on the mitochondria. Bax and Bak induce cytochrome c release. Importantly, cytochrome c release and necroptosis were diminished in Hep3B cells (Bax(-/-)) and Hep3B cells (Bak(-/-)). Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-2 could ameliorate GTP-induced cytochrome c release and necroptosis. Together, the findings suggested that GTP-induced necroptosis was modulated by the p53-independent pathway, which was related to the translocation of Bax and Bak to mitochondria, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases.
