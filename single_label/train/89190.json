{"id":89190,"title":"[Endovascular treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm a clinical analysis of 13 cases].","abstract":"To evaluate the effect of endovascular aneurysm repair(EVAR) of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm(rAAA) and to summarize the experience.The clinical data of 13 RAAA cases(males 11, females 2, age range 69-88) undergoing EVAR from February 2002 to February 2013 were retrospectively analyzed.It consisted of 10 atherosclerotic aneurysms and 3 pseudoaneurysms. CTA was finished in all of them. And they all undergone emergency surgery.All of the cases were successfully treated. During the perioperation , one suffered from contrast induced nephropathy and there were no deaths. During the follow-up, there were one case of type Ia endoleak treated by embolism and one case of rerupture pseudoaneurysm which abandoned treatment.Endovascular repair is the safe and effective treatment for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746079","annotations":[{"name":"Abdominal aortic aneurysm","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.829848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.807464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.746234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.382257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.274704,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.11514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Type Ia supernova","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova"},{"name":"Ia (genus)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ia_(genus)"},{"name":"List of Chicago Transit Authority bus routes","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chicago_Transit_Authority_bus_routes"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
