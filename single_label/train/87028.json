{"id":87028,"title":"Large number of imported chikungunya cases in mainland France, 2014: a challenge for surveillance and response.","abstract":"During the summer of 2014, all the pre-requisites for autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus are present in southern France: a competent vector, Aedes albopictus, and a large number of travellers returning from the French Caribbean islands where an outbreak is occurring. We describe the system implemented for the surveillance of chikungunya and dengue in mainland France. From 2 May to 4 July 2014, there were 126 laboratory-confirmed imported chikungunya cases in mainland France.","date":"2014-07-25","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060572","annotations":[{"name":"France","weight":0.747207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Caribbean","weight":0.671534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.244449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Tourism","weight":0.198881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism"},{"name":"Dengue fever","weight":0.131144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"},{"name":"Aedes","weight":0.126385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes"},{"name":"Aedes albopictus","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_albopictus"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Chikungunya","weight":0.0711346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikungunya"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.0381889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Island","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island"},{"name":"Metropolitan France","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_France"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0175445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"July 4","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_4"},{"name":"Jurisdiction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Large numbers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_numbers"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"2014 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"Southern France","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_France"},{"name":"French Caribbean","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Caribbean"}]}
