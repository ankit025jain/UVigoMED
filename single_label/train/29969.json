{"id":29969,"title":"Laboratory adverse events and discontinuation of therapy according to CD4(+) cell count at the start of antiretroviral therapy.","abstract":"Few data describe antiretroviral treatment (ART)-related adverse events when treatment is initiated at CD4(+) cell counts more than 350 cells/?l. We compared rates of laboratory-defined adverse events (LDAEs) according to CD4(+) cell count at ART initiation.Analysis of on-going cohort study.ART-naive persons initiating ART from 2000 to 2010 were included. Chi-square, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis tests compared characteristics among those starting ART with a CD4(+) cell count of 350 or less, 351-499 and at least 500 cells/?l. Time-updated Poisson regression compared rates of LDAE in the three CD4(+) cell strata. Cox proportional hazard models compared risk of ART discontinuation.Nine thousand, four hundred and six individuals were included: median age 37 years, 61% white, 80% men, median viral load 4.8 log copies/ml. Four hundred and forty-seven (4.9%) and 1099 (11.7%) started ART with a CD4(+) cell count at least 500 and 351-499 cells/?l, respectively. One thousand, two hundred and eighty-three (13.6%) patients experienced at least one LDAE. The rate of LDAE did not differ between those starting ART with a CD4(+) cell count 351-499 and less than 350 cells/?l [relative rate 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.09)], but an increased risk of ART discontinuation was observed (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.10-2.27). Those starting ART at CD4(+) cell count at least 500 cells/?l had an increased rate of LDAE (relative rate 1.44, 95% CI 1.13-1.82) but were not more likely to discontinue ART (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.64-2.09).This study demonstrates the need to consider ART-related toxicities when initiating therapy at CD4(+) cell counts at least 500 cells/?l. Whilst evidence from randomized controlled trials is awaited, the timing of ART initiation in terms of benefits and risks of ART remains an important question.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24583670","annotations":[{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.9065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.889037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.746519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.717633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.716905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.690903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.664792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.629021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.45027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.436965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.426066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Complete blood count","weight":0.423762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.303758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.303192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Logarithm","weight":0.267972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.202239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.189675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.123432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.121662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"White noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"David Cox (statistician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cox_(statistician)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
