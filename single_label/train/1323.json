{"id":1323,"title":"Burden of myocardial infarction attributable to road-traffic noise: a pilot study in Belgrade.","abstract":"The aim of this pilot study was to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) as a quantification of the burden of myocardial infarction (MI) attributable to road-traffic noise in Belgrade, Serbia. Exposure to road-traffic noise was estimated on a sample of almost 6000 adult inhabitants living in the central municipality Stari Grad in Belgrade, Serbia. Each participant was assigned to daytime noise levels for 16 h exposure measured on the street of current residence. Population-attributable fraction of MI due to road-traffic noise was calculated based on the distribution of the population in different noise exposure categories and the respective relative risk of MI compared to the reference level. DALYs due to noise-related MI were calculated as the sum of years of life lost and years with disability. The contribution of road traffic noise to the occurrence of MI for the population of the municipality Stari Grad in Belgrade equals 2.518%. Total DALY for MI due to road-traffic noise results in 176 years, that is, 115 years for men and 61 years for women. When adjusted for the present size of the population in Belgrade, total DALY due to road-traffic noise equals 107 years/million inhabitants that is, 70/million inhabitants for men and 37/million inhabitants for women. The burden of disease due to road-traffic noise in Belgrade is relatively small but noteworthy from the public health point of view.
