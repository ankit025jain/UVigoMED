{"id":30731,"title":"Hazardous alcohol use and intimate partner aggression among dating couples: the role of impulse control difficulties.","abstract":"To date, research identifying moderators of the alcohol-intimate partner aggression (IPA) relationship has focused almost exclusively on male-perpetrated aggression, without accounting for the dyadic processes of IPA. The current study examined hazardous alcohol use and impulse control difficulties as predictors of IPA among a sample of 73 heterosexual dating couples. Both actor and partner effects of these risk factors on physical and psychological aggression were examined. Results indicated that impulse control difficulties were an important actor and partner predictor of both physical and psychological aggression. Findings supported the multiple threshold model such that the interaction between impulse control difficulties and hazardous alcohol use significantly predicted physical aggression severity. These results suggest the importance of targeting impulse control difficulties and hazardous alcohol use in IPA treatment, as well as the advantages of examining risk factors of IPA within a dyadic rather than individual framework.","date":"2014-06-18","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24464403","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.579145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Heterosexuality","weight":0.496777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.430162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.395179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.33476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Intimate relationship","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_relationship"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Deferred gratification","weight":0.0509824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_gratification"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"International Phonetic Alphabet","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet"},{"name":"Partner effects","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partner_effects"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Presenter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenter"},{"name":"Domestic partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Threshold model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_model"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
