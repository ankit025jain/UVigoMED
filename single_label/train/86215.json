{"id":86215,"title":"Noncontrast perfusion single-photon emission CT/CT scanning: a new test for the expedited, high-accuracy diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.","abstract":"Standard ventilation and perfusion (V?/Q?) scintigraphy uses planar images for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). To evaluate whether tomographic imaging improves the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure, we compared noncontrast perfusion single-photon emission CT (Q?-SPECT)/CT scans with planar V?/Q?scans in patients at high risk for PE.Between 2006 and 2010, most patients referred for diagnosis of PE underwent both Q?-SPECT/CT scan and planar V?/Q?scintigraphy. All scans were reviewed retrospectively by four observers; planar scans were read with modified Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) II and Prospective Investigative Study of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PISA-PED) criteria. On Q?-SPECT/CT scan, any wedge-shaped peripheral perfusion defect occupying &gt; 50% of a segment without corresponding pulmonary parenchymal or pleural disease was considered to show PE. The final diagnosis was established with a composite reference standard that included ECG, ultrasound of lower-extremity veins, D-dimer levels, CT pulmonary angiography (when available), and clinical follow-up for at least 3 months.One hundred six patients with cancer and mean Wells score of 4.4 had sufficient follow-up; 22 patients were given a final diagnosis of PE, and 84 patients were given a final diagnosis of no PE. According to PIOPED II, 13 studies were graded as intermediate probability. Sensitivity and specificity for PE were 50% and 98%, respectively, based on PIOPED II criteria; 86% and 93%, respectively, based on PISA-PED criteria; and 91% and 94%, respectively, based on Q?-SPECT/CT scan. Seventy-six patients had additional relevant findings on the CT image of the Q?-SPECT/CT scan.Noncontrast Q?-SPECT/CT imaging has a higher accuracy than planar V?/Q?imaging based on PIOPED II criteria in patients with cancer and a high risk for PE.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798835","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Scintigraphy","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintigraphy"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Electrocardiography","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.772141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"CT pulmonary angiogram","weight":0.704696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_pulmonary_angiogram"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.689634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.620004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.591792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.545145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.472072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.425994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.41588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Tomographic reconstruction","weight":0.379962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomographic_reconstruction"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.363635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.303971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Composite material","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"},{"name":"Ventilation/perfusion scan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation/perfusion_scan"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.0168268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"}]}
