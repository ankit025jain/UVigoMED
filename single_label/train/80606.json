{"id":80606,"title":"Diagnosis of Trichomonous vaginalis by microscopy, latex agglutination, diamond's media, and PCR in symptomatic women, Khartoum, Sudan.","abstract":"Trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted disease. However, limited data are available on an effective technique for the diagnosis of Trichomonas vaginalis.A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of wet mount microscopy, latex agglutination, Diamond's media, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of T. vaginalis among symptomatic women who attended the gynecological clinic at Khartoum, Sudan.Of the 297 women studied, 252 (84.8%) were positive for T. vaginalis by wet mount microscopy, 257 (86.5%) by latex agglutination, 253 (85.2%) by Diamond's media, and 253 (85.2%) by PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of wet mount microscopy were 99.2% and 97.7%, respectively, compared with PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of latex agglutination and Diamond's media were 99.6% and 88.6%, and 100.0% and 86.4%, respectively, compared with PCR.In this study, wet mount microscopy, latex agglutination, and Diamond's media were found to be highly sensitive and specific. However, the availability and cost effectiveness might limit the use of Diamond's media and PCR in routine practice.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/7859723851211496.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602349","annotations":[{"name":"Trichomonas vaginalis","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichomonas_vaginalis"},{"name":"Sexually transmitted disease","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_disease"},{"name":"Trichomoniasis","weight":0.872134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichomoniasis"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.812148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.759622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.610423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.555683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.385045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.181069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Khartoum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum"},{"name":"Agglutination","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination"},{"name":"Sudan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"253","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/253"},{"name":"257","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/257"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"252","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/252"},{"name":"Siege of Khartoum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Khartoum"},{"name":"Trichomonas","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichomonas"},{"name":"Latex fixation test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex_fixation_test"},{"name":"Diamond","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"},{"name":"Sexual abuse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
