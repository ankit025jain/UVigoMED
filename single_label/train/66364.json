{"id":66364,"title":"Angiosarcoma arising in an arteriovenous fistula in a patient without kidney transplant.","abstract":"Angiosarcomas are relatively rare and account for only 1% of all sarcomas. They arise from endothelial cells of blood or lymph vessels. They are usually highly aggressive and long term outcome is poor with an overall 5-year survival rate of 10-20%. We report the case of a 80-year old man with an angiosarcoma arising in a non-functioning arteriovenous fistula. Angiosarcomas arising in an arteriovenous fistula are very rare and only eleven cases were found in the literature. In nine cases (82%) chronic immunosuppression, taken for renal transplant, was one of the causing factors. Our patient however did not receive a kidney transplant and was not on immunosuppressive therapy. Clinicians should be aware that an angiosarcoma can arise in an arteriovenous fistula even without chronic immunosuppression.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720144","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.786507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Angiosarcoma","weight":0.70518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiosarcoma"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Lymphatic vessel","weight":0.599018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_vessel"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.594297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.407031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Arteriovenous fistula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arteriovenous_fistula"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
