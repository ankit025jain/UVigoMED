{"id":78722,"title":"Nasal obstruction and unilateral chronic otitis media: evaluation by acoustic rhinometry.","abstract":"In a prospective study at Umraniye Research and Education Hospital, we aimed to evaluate the differences in acoustic rhinometric findings between the affected and nonaffected sides in patients with unilateral chronic otitis media (COM) and to investigate whether unilateral COM correlates with the side of nasal obstruction.Fifty-five consecutive patients with unilateral COM were involved in this study. All patients were evaluated with acoustic rhinometry, the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale, and measurement of their nasal mucociliary transport time.The mean cross-sectional area 1, mean cross-sectional area 2, volume 1, and volume 2 values were not different between the affected and nonaffected sides (p > 0.05). The NOSE score had a reverse correlation with the mean cross-sectional area 2 (p < 0.05) and volume 2 (p < 0.01) of the affected side. Saccharin time was not correlated with the acoustic rhinometric values of the affected side (p > 0.05).These findings do not support the hypothesis that unilateral COM is correlated with the side of nasal obstruction.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592575","annotations":[{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.540748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.282524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Saccharin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin"},{"name":"Spike-triggered average","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike-triggered_average"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Otitis media","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Acoustics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Scale model","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Nasal congestion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion"},{"name":"Otitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis"},{"name":"Human nose","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Component Object Model","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
