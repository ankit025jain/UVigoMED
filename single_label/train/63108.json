{"id":63108,"title":"Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma: a report from the German Hodgkin Study Group.","abstract":"Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (t-AML/MDS) represent severe late effects in patients treated for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Because more recent data are scarce, we retrospectively analyzed incidence, outcome, and risk factors for the development of t-AML/MDS after HL. A total of 11,952 patients treated for newly diagnosed HL within German Hodgkin Study Group trials between 1993 and 2009 were considered. At a median follow-up of 72 months, t-AML/MDS was diagnosed in 106/11,952 patients (0.9%). Median time from HL treatment to t-AML/MDS was 31 months. The median age of patients with t-AML/MDS was higher than in the whole patient group (43 vs 34 years, P < .0001). Patients who received 4 or more cycles of BEACOPP(escalated) had an increased risk to develop t-AML/MDS when compared with patients treated with less than 4 cycles of BEACOPP(escalated) or no BEACOPP chemotherapy (1.7% vs 0.7% vs 0.3%, P < .0001). The median overall survival (OS) for all t-AML/MDS patients was 7.2 months. However, t-AML/MDS patients proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a significantly better outcome with a median OS not reached after a median follow-up of 41 months (P < .001).","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478403","annotations":[{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.761812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Hodgkin's lymphoma","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.559514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.545798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.376807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.124614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"House of Lords","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
