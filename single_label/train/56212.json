{"id":56212,"title":"Relationship between macular bending and foveoschisis in myopic patients.","abstract":"To investigate factors associated with myopic foveoschisis and macular bending and to determine how the presence of macular bending affects the development of myopic foveoschisis.In a prospective study of 194 eyes of 105 patients with high myopia, we performed complete ophthalmic examinations, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and A-scan ultrasounds. Patients were divided into three groups according to the OCT results. Group 1 consisted of 25 eyes (17 patients) with myopic foveoschisis; group 2 consisted of 36 eyes (20 patients) with macular bending; and group 3 consisted of 135 eyes (68 patients) without macular bending, foveoschisis, or other diseases. Macular bending was defined as a smooth macular elevation observed upon OCT in patients with pathologic myopia. Age, sex, spherical equivalence, axial length (AXL), and OCT findings were obtained and compared to identify factors that are related to myopic foveoschisis and macular bending. Moreover, using the whole data set, we evaluated and correlated myopic foveoschisis with the presence or absence of macular bending to determine whether this bulge in the macular area influences the development of myopic foveoschisis.In group 1, all eyes presented posterior staphyloma and two factors were independently associated with a higher risk of having myopic foveoschisis: internal limiting membrane detachment (p < 0.001) and retinal arteriolar traction (p < 0.001). In group 2, only retinal arteriolar traction (p < 0.009) was independently associated with macular bending. Furthermore, macular bending was significantly correlated as a protective factor against myopic foveoschisis (adjusted odds ratio, 0.116; 95% confidence interval, 0.019 to 0.701; p < 0.019); the AXL of patients with the same spherical equivalence and macular bending was significantly shorter than that of patients without macular bending (p = 0.005).Intraocular and extraocular wall factors were associated with myopic traction maculopathy, which plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Moreover, macular bending might be a key factor in preventing myopic foveoschisis by decreasing AXL.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Eye
