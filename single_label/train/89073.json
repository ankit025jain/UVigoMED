{"id":89073,"title":"Switching suicide methods in order to achieve lethality: a study of Greek suicide victims.","abstract":"This article focused on the relation between the method of last attempted suicide and the method used during the subsequent completed suicide. Using the method of psychological autopsy, the authors studied all suicide cases from the Athens Greater Area during a 2-year period. Twenty-four percent of the victims had history of previous suicide attempts. The majority of the suicide attempters switched to a different method (p < 0.001) for their final act. This difference is primarily due to the individuals who had chosen self-poisoning or wrist cutting in their last attempted suicide. Both of these groups switched to hanging or jumping from a height for their final attempt. Individuals who attempted suicide by hanging or jumping became completers using mainly the same methods.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758213","annotations":[{"name":"Athens","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens"},{"name":"History","weight":0.522964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Autopsy","weight":0.432491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy"},{"name":"Greek language","weight":0.417959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.394998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.378001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"},{"name":"Jumping","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.114162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Suicide methods","weight":0.065579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_methods"},{"name":"Hanging","weight":0.0594293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Self-harm","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm"},{"name":"Parasuicide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasuicide"}]}
