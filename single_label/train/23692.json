{"id":23692,"title":"Fungemia due to Rhodotorula mucilaginosa in an immunocompetent, critically ill patient.","abstract":"Infections due to the yeast Rhodotorula are rare in humans. R. mucilaginosa is responsible for the majority of human cases, and immunocompromised individuals with central venous catheters are at greatest risk. There are few reports of bloodstream infections due to R. mucilaginosa in immunocompetent patients. We present a case report of fungemia due to R. mucilaginosa in an immunocompetent, critically ill patient, with good evolution with catheter removal and fluconazole therapy. We briefly review the spectrum of infections due to R. mucilaginosa and the management of bloodstream infections due to this yeast.","date":"2014-01-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475695","annotations":[{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.920976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Fungemia","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungemia"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.798123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.798092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.720804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.639067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.186224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Rhodotorula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodotorula"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"}]}
