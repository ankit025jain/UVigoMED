{"id":50197,"title":"Fasting whole blood fatty acid profile and risk of type 2 diabetes in adults: a nested case control study.","abstract":"to determine the association of fasting whole blood fatty acid concentrations with incidence of type 2 diabetes in adults.A nested case-control study of 187 subjects from a cohort of men and women aged 55-85 years from the Hunter Region, New South Wales, Australia. Fasting whole blood fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography and incidence of type 2 diabetes was ascertained by self-reported questionnaire at the study follow-up.After adjustment for potential confounding variables, positive associations with type 2 diabetes were seen for dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) (OR?=?1.04, 95% CI:1.01-1.07, P?=?0.01); arachidonic acid (ARA) (OR?=?1.01, 95% CI:1.00-1.01, P?=?0.002); alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (OR?=?1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.18, P?=?0.01); eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (OR?=?1.05, 95% CI:1.02-1.08, P?=?0.001); and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (OR?=?1.03, 95% CI:1.02-1.05, P<0.0001). Lignoceric acid is significantly associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk (OR?=?0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99, P?=?0.01).These data suggest that higher fasting whole blood concentrations of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6PUFA) (ARA and DGLA) as well as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3PUFA) (ALA, EPA, and DHA) are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, whereas increased fasting whole blood concentrations of lignoceric acid is inversely associated with diabetes risk.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816459","annotations":[{"name":"Eicosapentaenoic acid","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Docosahexaenoic acid","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fatty acid","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.837028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fat","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.758022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.693752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Alpha-Linolenic acid","weight":0.649908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Linolenic_acid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.633771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Case-control study","weight":0.490986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.488367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.425763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.223755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihomo-gamma-linolenic_acid"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.155323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"United States Environmental Protection Agency","weight":0.135219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency"},{"name":"New South Wales","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"},{"name":"South America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"South Wales","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Wales","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales"}]}
