{"id":17938,"title":"Decompression of peripheral nerve trunks in leprosy prevents the development and progression of deformities?","abstract":"Peripheral nerve involvement results in deformities formation in leprosy. High doses of (40-60 mg) steroids along with the anti-leprosy drugs is preferred even though the 70-75% cases develop deformity with the above treatment. 772 ulnar nerves, 120 median nerves and 108 posterior tibial nerves not responding to above medical treatment in 12 weeks, were undertaken for external and internal nerve trunk decompression. These cases were followed-up for 5-20 years at various intervals. The pain in nerves (neuritis) recovered in all cases of ulnar, median and posterior tibial nerves. Full sensory recovery with pin prick/feather or cotton wool touch was seen in 50% cases of all the three nerves. 20% cases maintain the pre-operative levels of sensory status. Plantar ulcers healed within 6 months after decompression of posterior tibial nerve. Only 6 cases showed reoccurrence. Overall motor recovery in ulnar nerve was seen 89% and 70% in median nerve. The sensory recovery restores protective sensation which prevents secondary injuries. The improvement of motor power gave better functional hands and improved the appearance which in absence of surgical intervention was not possible.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834637","annotations":[{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.810083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Ulnar nerve","weight":0.796632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Median nerve","weight":0.785117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_nerve"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.701314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Sensory system","weight":0.608749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_system"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.578218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Tibial nerve","weight":0.576276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibial_nerve"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.568822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.317957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.296524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Cotton","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton"},{"name":"Wool","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.10395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0720117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.0560487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Nerve plexus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_plexus"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Cotton wool","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_wool"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
