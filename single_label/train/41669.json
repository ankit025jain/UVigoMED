{"id":41669,"title":"Tacrolimus as a reasonable alternative in a patient with steroid-dependent and thiopurine-refractory autoimmune pancreatitis with IgG4-associated cholangitis.","abstract":"More recently, autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) in association with IgG4-positive cholangitis (IAC) has been recognised as a new and challenging entity. Currently, initiation of high dose steroids (e.g., prednisolone 0.5 - 1 mg/kg/day) followed by a steroid dose taper in combination with purine antagonists (e.g., azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) after resolution has been recommended as standard therapy.A 68-year-old male patient was referred to our institution in February 2012 for therapy evaluation of a steroid-dependent course of autoimmune pancreatitis type 1 with IgG4-associated cholangitis. Since the first diagnosis in March 2011, the patient was treated with high-dose steroids with good response. Whenever steroids were tapered down to a daily dose <20 mg, cholestatic liver enzymes increased dramatically despite concurrent immunosuppressive therapy primarily with azathioprine and 6-MP thereafter. Therefore, we restarted steroid therapy (1 mg/kg/day) in combination with tacrolimus achieving a target level of 5 - 7 ng/mL. During the down-tapering phase, follow-up examinations presented a patient in good general condition without jaundice. Moreover, liver and pancreatic enzymes and also immunoglobulins returned to normal values without any evidence of relapse up today (66 weeks).In this case, the combination of steroids with tacrolimus seems to be a reasonable alternative in a patient with steroid-dependent and thiopurine-refractory autoimmune pancreatitis with IgG4-associated cholangitis. To date, this is the first description of such a therapeutic approach for this entity.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24905108","annotations":[{"name":"Azathioprine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathioprine"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Prednisolone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisolone"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.826839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Mercaptopurine","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaptopurine"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Purine","weight":0.786293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine"},{"name":"Cholestasis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestasis"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.683457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.388064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.302246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Acute intermittent porphyria","weight":0.115869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_intermittent_porphyria"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Digestive enzyme","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_enzyme"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0289708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Cholangitis","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangitis"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"}]}
