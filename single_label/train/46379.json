{"id":46379,"title":"Novel fundoplication for esophagogastrostomy after proximal gastrectomy.","abstract":"Stapled esophagogastrostomy is simple and safe reconstruction after proximal gastrectomy. However, this reconstruction is often concomitant with severe reflux esophagitis because of the loss of cardiac function; simple esophagogastrostomy is not preferred reconstruction after proximal gastrectomy. To prevent reflux esophagitis, we established the fundoplication under the endoscopic stent after proximal gastrectomy.After proximal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection, end-to-side esophago-gastrostomy was done with circular suturing instrument. To prevent gastric juice reflux from the remnant stomach, the stomach was rolling around the abdominal esophagus and tightly under the endoscopical stenting. To make renewal His angle and fornix, the stump of greater curvature was fixed to the left side of diaphragmatic crus with some sutures.We performed this type of fudplication for 18 patients with early gastric cancers and gastric submucosal tumors. Almost all patients postoperative course was uneventful. Three patients needed an endoscopic dilatation for the stricture of esophago-gastrostomy. One case revealed asymptomatic reflux esophagitis because of the looseness of the anastomosis. Weight loss was limited, almost all patients recovered preoperative weight.Simple esophagogastrostomy plus this fundoplication with endoscopic stent is safe and satisfactory reconstruction procedure after proximal gastrectomy.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634949","annotations":[{"name":"Gastrectomy","weight":0.910318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrectomy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Esophagitis","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.831315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Esophageal dilatation","weight":0.831158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_dilatation"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Gastric acid","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.706273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Thoracic diaphragm","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.430793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Submucosa","weight":0.346175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submucosa"},{"name":"Nissen fundoplication","weight":0.21018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissen_fundoplication"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.117418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0311489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.0267211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Reflux","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Juice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Greater curvature of the stomach","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_curvature_of_the_stomach"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
