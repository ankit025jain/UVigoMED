{"id":47490,"title":"Periportal CD4+ cell infiltration increases in HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients commencing ART, whereas CD8+ cells clear from the liver.","abstract":"Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common in Asia, but the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are unclear. Histopathological changes in the liver are described in a prospective study of HCV-seropositive HIV-infected patients at Cipto Mangunkusomo Hospital (Jakarta, Indonesia). Liver biopsy specimens were collected at baseline (n = 48) and 48 weeks (n = 34). Ishak scores showed mild but detectable inflammation and/or fibrosis. Levels of portal inflammation declined during ART (P = .03), whereas fibrosis remained (P = .11). Portal infiltration of CD4(+) cells increased during ART (P < .0001), whereas infiltration of CD8(+) cells subsided. Numbers of CD4(+) cells in the liver at baseline correlated with circulating CD4(+) T-cell counts (P = .03-.05). Numbers of liver-infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells at baseline were not associates with subsequent experience of an immune restoration disease, which is defined by a rise in alanine transaminase levels during ART.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585895","annotations":[{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Hepatitis C","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Hepatitis C virus","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Liver biopsy","weight":0.754569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_biopsy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.529272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.513243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.512908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.406674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.37894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Indonesia","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.144919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Jakarta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"},{"name":"Book of Numbers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Assisted reproductive technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_reproductive_technology"}]}
