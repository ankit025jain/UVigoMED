{"id":68639,"title":"[Effects of SIPL1 screened by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) on biological function and drug resistance of renal cell carcinoma cells].","abstract":"To screen the differentially expressed genes in human renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCC) cells using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), and to explore their biological function and underlying mechanism in RCC cells.Total RNAs were extracted from human renal clear-cell carcinoma cell line RLC-310 and human normal renal cell line HK-2 cells, and SSH technology was used to construct a RCC cell library of differential expression genes and to screen the most differentially expressed genes. RNA interference vector was constructed to silence the expression of the differentially expressed gene SIPL1 in human renal cell lines RLC-310 and GRC-1. Proliferation index was estimated by cell counting, MTT and tumor xenograft assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Drug resistance potential to adriamycin was assessed by MTT.A subtractive cDNA library of highly expressed genes in the RCC cells was constructed and 12 differentially expressed genes were screened from the subtractive library, in which SIPL1 was the most differently expressed gene in the RCC cell line. SIPL1 overexpression in the RCC cells and clinical samples was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. The shRNA expression plasmid targeting to SIPL1 gene was constructed and transfected into RLC-310 and GRC-1 cells, resulting in downregulation of SIPL1. SIPL1 knockdown inhibited the cell proliferation (P < 0.05) and tumorgenesis. The tumor weights formed by RLC-310 cells transfected with SIPL1 shRNA was (0.22 ± 0.07)g and that of negative control vector was (0.85 ± 0.06)g. The tumor weight formed by GRC-1 cells was (0.32 ± 0.07)g and that of control vectors was (1.21 ± 0.11)g (P < 0.05). SIPL1 shRNA-transfected RLC-310 cells showed that more cells were arrested at G0/G1 phase [(71.13 ± 4.58)%] than that in the negative control RLC-310 cells [(53.27 ± 3.34)%, P < 0.05]. The proportion of G0/G1 phase in the SIPL1 shRNA transfected GRC-1 cells was (73.83 ± 3.97)%, significantly higher than that of (59.33 ± 3.03)% in the negative control GRC-1 cells (P < 0.05), and enhanced their sensitivity to adriamycin (P < 0.05). Silence of SIPL1 caused inactivation of AKT signaling and up-regulated expression of P27(Kip1) and P21(Cip1) proteins.A differentially expressed gene SIPL1 in the renal clear-cell carcinoma is successfully screened using SSH technology. SIPL1 functions as an oncogene in RCC, and may become a novel molecular target for RCC diagnosis and therapy.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital
