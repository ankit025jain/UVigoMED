{"id":47973,"title":"Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive ?-fetoprotein decline after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma predicts survival.","abstract":"Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive ?-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) is a fucosylated fraction of AFP that is highly specific for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We studied the relationship between AFP-L3 response and treatment outcome in terms of radiologic response and overall survival in patients undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).We retrospectively analyzed 152 patients with advanced HCC undergoing TACE. Serum AFP-L3 and AFP levels were measured simultaneously with a novel lectin dual-label time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (lectin dual-label TRFIA). AFP-L3 response was defined as a ?20% reduction in AFP-L3 level after a minimum of 2 cycles of chemotherapy.A total of 47 AFP-L3 responders had improved median overall survival of 42.9 months compared with 15.4 months in nonresponders (P<0.0001), and AFP-L3 response was strongly associated with radiologic response (P<0.0001). The combination of AFP-L3 response and serum AFP response provided further prognostic information. On multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of AFP-L3 response was independent of maximum tumor diameter and BCLC stage.A significant reduction in AFP-L3 in patients with advanced HCC is an important predictor of survival. Achieving an AFP-L3 response should be one of the therapeutic intents of TACE.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565960","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.897423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.718253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.631257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.477993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.329545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.325228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.161574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lectin","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectin"},{"name":"Chemoembolization","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoembolization"},{"name":"Alpha-fetoprotein","weight":0.110746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-fetoprotein"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Fucose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucose"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Aladdin Free Public License","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_Free_Public_License"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Lentil","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentil"},{"name":"Lens (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"RC Lens","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_Lens"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
