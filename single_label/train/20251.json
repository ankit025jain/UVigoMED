{"id":20251,"title":"Non-response to the intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment in children: evaluation and outcome [Short Communication].","abstract":"The present study evaluates the causes for the persistence of symptoms and radiological signs after at least 2 months of intensive anti-tuberculosis treatment in children. In this prospective observational study, 26 paediatric patients with partial or no response to anti-tuberculosis treatment after the 2-month intensive phase were enrolled. After a detailed history and workup, it was found that 9 (34.6%) patients had a wrong initial diagnosis, while 12 (46.2%) had either received inadequate treatment or had complications requiring prolonged treatment; 5 (19.2%) failed to respond. Failure to respond to anti-tuberculosis treatment in paediatric tuberculosis seems to be over-diagnosed.
