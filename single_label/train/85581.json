{"id":85581,"title":"Pharmacological treatment of depression in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: impact on the course of the disease and health outcomes.","abstract":"Over 40 % of older chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients suffer from clinically significant depressive symptoms, which may interfere with their daily activities. Untreated depression may increase physical disability, social isolation, hopelessness and healthcare utilization. This review examined the impact of depression on the course of COPD, and the efficacy of antidepressant drug therapy and its implications for clinical practice. The efficacy of antidepressants in published trials in patients with COPD has been inconclusive. Specifically, there has been no clear evidence that antidepressants can induce remission of depression or ameliorate dyspnoea or physiological indices of COPD. Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) studies conducted in depressed COPD patients have been significantly limited by methodological weaknesses including small sample size, sample heterogeneity and variability in the scales used to diagnose and monitor the treatment of depression. For this reason, it remains unclear which SSRIs or TCAs should be favoured in the treatment of depressed COPD patients and what are appropriate dosages and duration ranges. Simply offering antidepressant drugs to older depressed COPD patients is unlikely to improve their condition. Promising treatment strategies such as a collaborative treatment approach and cognitive behavioural therapy should be considered for depressed COPD patients, with or without antidepressant drug therapy. Further studies are needed, including large, randomized, controlled trials with long-term follow-up, to examine the efficacy of antidepressants in patients with COPD.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902934","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary
