{"id":23508,"title":"[Thoracic nocardiosis with thoracic manifestations in two immunocompetent patients].","abstract":"Nocardiosis is a rare infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus nocardia, which causes considerable morbidity and mortality. We report two unusual cases of nocardiosis in young, immunocompetent patients; the first case involved a nocardia farcinica pulmonary and chest-wall infection, while the second was an anterior mediastinal nocardia asiaticum infection mimicking a mediastinal tumor. These cases reflect the need for a broad differential diagnosis during exploration of thoracic findings, white the potentially ambiguous presentation of nocardiosis must be considered.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482994","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.793624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Differential diagnosis","weight":0.749348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_diagnosis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.722721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Mediastinum","weight":0.659673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.633355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.51033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Nocardia","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocardia"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0881311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Nocardiosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocardiosis"},{"name":"Mediastinal tumor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinal_tumor"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
