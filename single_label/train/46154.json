{"id":46154,"title":"[Analyse related factors of impact and prognosis of 73 cases of severe hepatitis].","abstract":"A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the clinical features and prognostic factors of 73 cases of severe hepatitis.To summarize clinical features of 73 cases of severe hepatitis, grouping by etiology and pathogenesis. A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between biochemical characteristics (liver function, renal function, electrolytes, PTA, etc) and complications (hepatic encephalopathy, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome, ascites, abdominal infections, etc) and prognosis.(1) HBV infection alone accounted for 65.75%. Alcoholic liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis E, autoimmune hepatitis, overlapping causes and other factors were five cases (6.85%), six cases (8.22%), two cases (2.74%), two cases (2.74%), seven cases (9.59%) and three cases (4.11%) respectively. According to the incidence rate, severity and underlying liver condition, subacute hepatitis, cases based on chronic hepatitis and on cirrhosis were 12 cases (16.43%), 11 cases (15.07%), 50 cases (68.49%) respectively. Clinical manifestations with or without hepatic encephalopathy accounted for 58.90% or 41.10%. (2) The highest mortality of severe hepatitis was alcoholic liver disease and patients on the basis of overlapping factors (66.67%), followed by autoimmune liver disease (50%). The mortality of HBV-related hepatitis was 18.75%. Overall mortality of 73 cases of severe hepatitis was 28.77%, of which cirrhosis group was higher than non-cirrhotic group (40% vs 4.3%, P = 0.002). The difference was statistically significant. Patients without hepatic encephalopathy had lower mortality than with hepatic encephalopathy (3.33% vs 46.51%). The mortality of patients with hepatic encephalopathy Stage III and IV was 72.73%. (3) Independent samples t test filtered nine factors associated with death, namely cirrhosis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, serum creatinine, total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), albumin (ALB) and serum sodium. The results of multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis indicated that hepatic encephalopathy, serum creatinine levels were risk factors for death, whereas ALB as a protective factor.Hepatic encephalopathy, serum creatinine levels were risk factors for severe hepatitis death, But ALB was protective factor. Nucleotide analogs using was the main reason why the mortality of hepatitis B was as low as 18.75%.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System
