{"id":67671,"title":"Transplantation: early hospital readmissions after kidney transplantation.","abstract":"A new study reports that 30.5% of kidney transplant recipients have an early hospital readmission (EHR; defined as within 30 days of discharge). As EHR is a strong independent risk factor for allograft loss and mortality, efforts should be made to implement and improve systems to minimize risk of EHR in these patients.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595039","annotations":[{"name":"Death","weight":0.537146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.470794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Kidney transplantation","weight":0.334485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_transplantation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.197134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Independent school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Electronic health record","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record"}]}
