{"id":70349,"title":"Sono-photodynamic combination therapy: a review on sensitizers.","abstract":"Cancer is characterized by the dysregulation of cell signaling pathways at several steps. The majority of current anticancer therapies involve the modulation of a single target. A tumor-targeting drug-delivery system consists of a tumor detection moiety and a cytotoxic material joined directly or through a suitable linker to form a conjugate. Photodynamic therapy has been used for more than 100 years to treat tumors. One of the present goals of photodynamic therapy research is to enhance the selective targeting of tumor cells in order to reduce the risk and extension of unwanted side-effects, caused by normal cell damage. Sonodynamic therapy is a promising new treatment for patients with cancer. It treats cancer with ultrasound and sonosensitive agents. Porphyrin compounds often serve as photosensitive and sonosensitive agents. The combination of these two methods makes cancer treatment more effective. The present review provides an overview of photodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, sono-photodynamic therapy and the four sensitizers which are suitable candidates for combined sono-photodynamic therapy.
