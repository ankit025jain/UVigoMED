{"id":84049,"title":"Recognition and treatment of life-threatening events in the community setting-part 1: the journey.","abstract":"Community-based care provision and the associated workload for health professionals working in the community are on the increase. In recent years, in particular, there has been a greater requirement for the acute aspect of care. It is of the utmost importance that patient deterioration is recognised, and that staff can escalate care in an appropriate and timely way. Of the 576 potentially avoidable deaths reported to the National Patient Safety Agency in 2005, 64 were related to patient deterioration not being recognised or acted upon. The community-specific 'Acute Life-threatening Events Recognition and Treatment' (CSA) course enables practitioners (both registered and non-registered) to identify deteriorating patients and to take appropriate action to ensure that safe, quality care is maintained through early recognition and improved clinical decision-making. North Somerset Community Partnership is the first community area in the UK to facilitate the CSA course. This article is the first of a two-part series on the course. It details the journey from the start, identifying the challenges that were overcome and the success that has followed.
