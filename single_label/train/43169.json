{"id":43169,"title":"[Two cases of colonic diverticular bleeding in which the combination of a planned marking clip and dynamic computed tomography was useful for identification of the bleeding site].","abstract":"We experienced two cases of shock secondary to colonic diverticular bleeding. Both patients showed signs of shock after each episode of melena; however, the bleeding site could not be initially identified because multiple diverticula were present and the bleeding spontaneously ceased during each examination. Therefore, we subsequently performed planned clipping and dynamic computed tomography scanning of the area surrounding the potential bleeding sites to look for signs of vascular leakage and to determine the clip location. The use of this method enabled us to successfully identify the bleeding site in both cases. Thus, this method can be useful in identifying the site of colonic diverticular bleeding that may cause shock.
