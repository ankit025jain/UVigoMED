{"id":71864,"title":"[Big osteoma of ethmoid sinus].","abstract":"Sinus osteoma is a common nasal and sinus disease, while the clinical cases of osteoma with a diameter greater than 30 millimeter are rarely seen. This paper reports a case of a 39-years-old male patient discovered with one-year long swelling pain in the right eye. The patients' right eye was mildly prominent and he suffered from hypopsia and diplopia. After CT scanned, he have ethmoid osteoma been discovered, besides, the right media rectus compression and orbital apex compression and consequent pathologically were diagnosed. The solid tumor ranged widely from the anterior skull base to the superior and interior orbital walls,and thus deprived the patient's complete surgical resection. As an attempt to prevent complications, most parts of the tumors were sur gically removed.","date":"2014-07-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026835","annotations":[{"name":"Diplopia","weight":0.852679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.787712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Ethmoid sinus","weight":0.764717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethmoid_sinus"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.702375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Ethmoid bone","weight":0.69374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethmoid_bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.666594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.613776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.540779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Osteoma","weight":0.535257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoma"},{"name":"Orbit (anatomy)","weight":0.483031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.370796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.223648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.192892,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Base of skull","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_of_skull"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0812996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Sinus (anatomy)","weight":0.0193971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Nasal bone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"},{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"}]}
