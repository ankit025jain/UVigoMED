{"id":72909,"title":"Significance of 18?F-FDG PET and immunohistochemical GLUT-1 expression for cardiac myxoma.","abstract":"Cardiac tumours are relatively rare and are difficult to diagnose merely with imaging techniques. We demonstrated an unusual case of left atrial myxoma, displaying the successful detection by positron emission tomography using 2-deoxy-2-[18?F] fluoro-D-glucose (18?F-FDG PET), correlated closely to more intense and enhanced immunoreactivity with glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) in a substantial number of cardiac myxoma cells. Further prospective studies are needed to validate the significance of 18?F-FDG PET findings for cardiac myxoma and the association with immunohistochemical GLUT-1 expression in its tumour cells, after collecting and investigating a larger number of surgical cases examined with both of them.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/2991481941253449.","date":"2014-07-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934577","annotations":[{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.744813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.66819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.637633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.564559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.486326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.400215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Glucose transporter","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_transporter"},{"name":"Atrium (heart)","weight":0.234722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Left atrium","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_atrium"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Atrial myxoma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_myxoma"},{"name":"Myxoma","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxoma"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Virtual reality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality"}]}
