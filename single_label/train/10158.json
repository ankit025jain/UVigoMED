{"id":10158,"title":"Rapid and real-time detection of Porcine Sapelovirus by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay.","abstract":"The present study describes the development and validation of a one-step, single-tube, and real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) detecting Porcine Sapelovirus. RT-LAMP characterized by one strand displacement reaction with the specific stem-loop structure and Bst DNA polymerase could be finished in 60 min under isothermal condition at 63 Â°C. RT-LAMP assay showed higher sensitivity with 10(1) copies/?L than RT-PCR for the detection of Sapelovirus. The specificity of RT-LAMP assay was validated by the absence of any cross-reaction with other closely related virus in Picornaviridae group and other common virus causing porcine diarrhea. 7 positive Sapelovirus infection out of 63 fecal samples were identified using RT-LAMP, while 5 positive samples were determined by a conventional RT-PCR. A cost-effective method for Saplovirus detection with high sensitivity and specificity was developed and evaluated.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667302","annotations":[{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Reverse transcription","weight":0.656238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.610561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.590604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Picornavirus","weight":0.519897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picornavirus"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.352433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.339153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.144691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Bacillus stearothermophilus","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_stearothermophilus"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0789213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Isothermal process","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothermal_process"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Obverse and reverse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"}]}
