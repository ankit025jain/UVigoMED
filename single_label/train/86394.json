{"id":86394,"title":"The ruthenium complexes cis-(dichloro)tetramineruthenium(III) chloride and cis-tetraammine(oxalato)ruthenium(III) dithionate overcome resistance inducing apoptosis on human lung carcinoma cells (A549).","abstract":"Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world, and non-small cell lung carcinoma accounts for approximately 75-85 % of all lung cancers. In the present work, we studied the antitumor activity of the compound cis-(dichloro)tetramineruthenium(III) chloride {cis-[RuCl2(NH3)4]Cl} against human lung carcinoma tumor cell line A549. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between the expression of MDR1 and CYP450 genes in human lung carcinoma cell lines A549 treated with cisCarboPt, cisCRu(III) and cisDRu(III). The ruthenium-based coordinated complexes presented low cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities, with high IC50 values, 196 (±15.49), 472 (±20.29) and 175 (±1.41) for cisCarboPt, cisCRu(III) and cisDRu(III), respectively. The tested compounds induced apoptosis in A549 tumor cells as evidenced by caspase 3 activation, but only at high concentrations. Results also revealed that the amplification of P-gp gene is greater in A549 cells exposed to cisCarboPt and cisCRu(III) than cisDRu(III). Taken together all these results strongly demonstrate that MDR-1 over-expression in A549 cells could be associated to a MDR phenotype of these cells and moreover, it is also contributing to the platinum, and structurally-related compound, resistance in these cells. The identification and characterization of novel mechanisms of drug resistance will enable the development of a new generation of anti-cancer drugs that increase cancer sensitivity and/or represent more effective chemotherapeutic agents.","date":"2014-05-09","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781824","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.814491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Chloride","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.772261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"P-glycoprotein","weight":0.75467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.727605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.718009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Chlorine","weight":0.710784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.620228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.543912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"},{"name":"Caspase 3","weight":0.493058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase_3"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.482717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.478623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.440975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.402246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.364981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.36082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.313149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Human lung","weight":0.268286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_lung"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.200046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Ruthenium","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenium"},{"name":"List of causes of death by rate","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Ammonium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"}]}
