{"id":67341,"title":"Clinico-pathological study of glomerular diseases in patients with significant proteinuria in North India.","abstract":"Proteinuria is a common manifestation of renal disease. The present study was carried out to analyze the clinic-pathological correlation, assess the value of histopathology and immunofluorescence (IF) as well as note the spectrum of renal diseases in patients with significant proteinuria. Fifty consecutive patients having proteinuria >1 g/24 h underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy. Clinical information was correlated with the pathological findings and the results were analyzed. The patients were in the age range of 12-79 years. Males (60%) outnumbered females (40%) in all the disease categories except lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy. The most common clinical presentation was the nephrotic syndrome, seen in 31 cases (62%). Primary glomerular diseases (72%) were more common than secondary glomerular diseases (24%) and tubulointerstitial diseases (4%). Overall, the most common pathological diagnosis was focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (20%), followed by membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) (18%). In young patients (age <20 years), minimal change disease (36.4%) was the most common diagnosis while in adults it was MGN (23.5%) and in elderly patients (age >60 years) it was FSGS (60%). IF modified the diagnosis in 12% of the cases. The concordance between clinical diagnosis and pathological diagnosis was 66%. The difference between clinical diagnosis and final diagnosis was statistically significant. Our study further reinforces the knowledge that renal biopsy helps in accurate diagnosis and, thus, helps in appropriate management of the patients. IF provides additional information that can make the morphologic diagnosis considerably more precise.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626024","annotations":[{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.873654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"IgA nephropathy","weight":0.871875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgA_nephropathy"},{"name":"Nephritis","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephritis"},{"name":"Glomerulonephritis","weight":0.826996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.823556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.772147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Lupus nephritis","weight":0.731565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_nephritis"},{"name":"Membranous glomerulonephritis","weight":0.692949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membranous_glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Minimal change disease","weight":0.442393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_change_disease"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.377256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"India","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Renal biopsy","weight":0.268065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_biopsy"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.256089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.235804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.166125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis","weight":0.0588112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"}]}
