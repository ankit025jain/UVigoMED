{"id":13098,"title":"Anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic activities of capillarisin via suppression of inflammatory signaling in animal model.","abstract":"Artemisia capillaris has widespread traditional and pharmacological applications such as analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, enhance immunity and anti-tumor activity properties. To evaluate the pharmacological activities of this plant, capillarisin, one of the potent constituent of Artemisia capillaris was studied based on anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic effects with detailed mechanism. It can be assumed that measurement of anti-nociceptive effects of capillarisin is one of the parameter for the evaluation of this herb. Capillarisin has extensive pharmacological properties and has been considered to have promising ant-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activities. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of capillarisin and underlying molecular mechanisms of action in preventing acute and subchronic inflammatory pain.The inflammatory pain was induced after 40 min or 1h of administration of vehicle, 70% EtOH extract of Artemisia capillaris (100mg/kg) or capillarisin (20 and 80 mg/kg) by intraplantar (i.p.l.) injections of CFA and carrageenan in ICR mice, respectively. Mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were evaluated in both acute and subchronic models. Further analysis was performed in CFA-induced mice exploring various molecular and signaling pathways such as NF-?B, AP-1, and ERK-CREB involved in the persistent pain sensations.In acute model, mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were evaluated after every 2h until 6h of CFA and after 4h of carrageenan injections. Whereas, in subchronic inflammatory pain model, mechanical hyperalgesia and paw edema were measured after 4h of CFA injection and every day after 4h of daily treatment until 5 days with interval of day four in order to assess the tolerance effect of capillarisin. Further analysis was performed in CFA-induced mice exploring various molecular and signaling pathways such as NF-?B, AP-1 and ERK-CREB involved in the persistent of pain sensations. Pre-treatment of capillarisin strongly inhibited NF-?B mediated genes (iNOS, COX-2), involved in pain. The plasma leading nitrite production was significantly reduced by capillarisin. Moreover, i.p. administration of capillarisin markedly suppressed the adenosine 5?-triphosphate (ATP) in plasma and substance P in CFA-induced paw tissue.The present study indicates that capillarisin possessed promising anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic effects through the inhibition of various inflammatory pain signaling, suggesting that capillarisin constitutes a significant component for the treatment of inflammatory pain.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495472","annotations":[{"name":"Substance
