{"id":87865,"title":"[Percutaneous fixation for the treatment of un-displaced scaphoid fractures with herbert cannulated screws through volar approach].","abstract":"To summarize the experience of percutaneous fixation of scaphoid fractures with Herbert screws through volar approach, and provide a reliable and efficient treatment method for scaphoid fractures.From April 2008 to September 2012,15 patients with scaphoid fractures were treated by percutaneous fixation with Herbert cannulated screws through volar approach including 14 males and 1 female with an average age of 35 years ranging from 25 to 45 years old. Among them, 10 cases were on left side and 5 cases were on right side. Durations from injury to operation ranged from 3 to 10 days with an average of 5 days. All these cases were identified as B2 type according to the Herbert classification based on X-ray and CT scan. In order to assess the function of wrist, all patients were calculated according to Krimmer's score postoperatively.The follow-up period were from 5 to 18 months with an average of 10 months. At 3 months after operation,X-ray was re-checked every month. All the patients achieved bone union with a mean time of 10 weeks (ranged from 7 to 14 weeks) postoperatively. According to Krimmer's score, 14 cases gained 100 scores as perfect and one case got 90 scores as good. The small volar incision of all patients were union at the first period. No operation complications such as infection and nonunion occurred.Percutaneous fixation with Herbert cannulated screws through volar approach is a reliable and efficient treatment method for scaphoid fractures with small invasion, high bone union rate, and fewer complications.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974417","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.418098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.40316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.275382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Timothy Herbert","weight":0.0506365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Herbert"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Scaphoid bone","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphoid_bone"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0177821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Perfect (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Nitrogen fixation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
