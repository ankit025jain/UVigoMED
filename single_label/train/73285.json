{"id":73285,"title":"A phase I study of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and temsirolimus in patients with refractory solid malignancies.","abstract":"This study aimed to determine the maximum-tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in combination with temsirolimus (T) in patients with refractory solid tumors. Using a standard \"3+3\" dose escalation design, 23 patients were enrolled in three dosing cohorts in this phase I study. The starting dose level was PLD at 30 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks and T at 20 mg weekly. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of doxorubicin were evaluated for patients in the expansion cohort. The most common treatment-related adverse events of all grades were mucositis/stomatitis (69.6%), anorexia (52.2%), thrombocytopenia (52.2%), and fatigue (47.8%). The recommended doses of this combination for phase II studies are 25 mg/m(2) PLD and 25 mg T. PK analyses suggested increased exposure of doxorubicin in this combination regimen compared to doxorubicin administered as a single agent, possibly due to PK drug interactions. Out of 18 patients evaluable for a treatment response, two had partial responses (PR) (breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma) and six had stable disease (SD). Two patients remained on treatment for more than 1 year. The combination of PLD and T is tolerable, and the treatment resulted in clinical benefit. The combination regimen should be further explored in appropriate tumor types.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916546","annotations":[{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.731362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.706065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.678583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Temsirolimus","weight":0.626629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temsirolimus"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.582909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Drug interaction","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.483756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"PEGylation","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGylation"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0961829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Phospholipase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phospholipase"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Public relations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations"}]}
