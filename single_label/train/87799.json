{"id":87799,"title":"Strain distribution due to propagation of tears in the anterior supraspinatus tendon.","abstract":"Rotator cuff tears are a significant clinical problem. Tears in the anterior supraspinatus might behave differently compared to central tears due to differences in regional structural properties. The objective of this study was to determine strain distributions for anterior supraspinatus tendon tears and the relationship to tear propagation during cyclic loading. It was hypothesized that highest maximum principal strain would be posterior to the tear, and tears would propagate in the direction of the maximum principal strain. Eight human cadaveric supraspinatus tendons with surgically created small tears in the anterior third were tested with increasing levels of cyclic loads. The position of strain markers was recorded on the bursal surface of the tendon to calculate strain. Tendons reached a 2?cm critical tendon retraction at 580?±?181?N. Largest strains were found medial and posterior to the tear (26.1?±?9.4%). In five tendons, the strain direction for the initial (114?±?28°) and final loading sets (86?±?20°) indicated the strain direction shifted from an anterior to posterior orientation (p?<?0.01), corresponding to the direction of tear propagation. Based on the results, anterior supraspinatus tears would remain isolated to the supraspinatus tendon during activities of daily living.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24985532","annotations":[{"name":"Human","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Chemical structure","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_structure"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Rotator cuff","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff"},{"name":"Supraspinatus muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraspinatus_muscle"},{"name":"Strain (materials science)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(materials_science)"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0254237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0173619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Sexual orientation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tears","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Synovial bursa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_bursa"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Cuff","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff"},{"name":"Deformation (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Rotator (album)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_(album)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Set (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Object (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
