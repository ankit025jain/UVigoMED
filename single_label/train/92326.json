{"id":92326,"title":"Carbohydrate beverages attenuate bone resorption markers in elite runners.","abstract":"We evaluated the effects of carbohydrate (CHO) supplementation on markers of bone turnover in elite runners.Twenty-four male runners were randomly assigned to two groups--a CHO and a control (CON) group--using a double-blind design. The participants were submitted to an overload training program (days 1-8), followed by a high-intensity intermittent running protocol (10×800 m) on day 9. They received a maltodextrin solution (CHO group) or a placebo solution as the CON equivalent, before, during, and after these protocols.After 8 days of intensive training, baseline levels of osteocalcin (OC) decreased in both CHO and CON groups (before: 28.8±3.6 and 26.6±2.4 ng/ml, after: 24.8±3.0 and 21.9±1.6 ng/ml, respectively, p<0.01). On day 9, at 80 min of the recovery period, carboxy-terminal of telopeptide type I collagen (CTX) serum concentration was suppressed in the CHO group (0.3±0.1 ng/ml) vs. 0.6±0.0 ng/ml for the CON group (p<0.01). CHO supplementation was effective in decreasing CTX levels from baseline to recovery (0.5±0.1 ng/mL to 0.3±0.1 ng/mL, p<0.001), while an increase from 0.4±0.0 ng/mL to 0.6±0.0 ng/mL (p<0.001) was observed in the CON group.CHO beverage ingestion attenuated the exercise-induced increase in CTX concentration, suggesting that CHO supplementation is a potential strategy to prevent bone damage in athletes.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239216","annotations":[{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.768905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Placebo","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.478664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.474715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"Osteocalcin","weight":0.427867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteocalcin"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.155952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Drink","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.143833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Maltodextrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltodextrin"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Running","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"10000 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10000_(number)"},{"name":"Strength training","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Cholet Basket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholet_Basket"},{"name":"Stream","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream"},{"name":"Type-I collagen","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-I_collagen"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Elite","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite"}]}
