{"id":28377,"title":"Substance use and sexual risk among at-risk adolescents in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.","abstract":"We examined the difference in prevalence of substance use and sexual risk behaviors among at-risk youth participants in programs offered by community-based organizations in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, by gender and organization type (governmental vs. non-governmental). 388 adolescents were recruited from 25 intervention-based organizations servicing at-risk youth between the ages of 12 and 17 in Juiz de Fora. Participants completed a 15-item survey assessing substance use and sexual risk behaviors, along with socio-demographic predictors of these behaviors. Males were more likely to report drug and alcohol use associated with homelessness and abandonment. Females were more likely to report sexual risk taking associated with neighborhood crime. Participants from non-governmental organizations were less likely to engage in all measured risk behaviors. The present analysis points to the need to understand how Brazil's Child and Adolescent Act is being applied and the implications this has for intervention and the promotion of positive health outcomes for young people.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896054","annotations":[{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Crime","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.711625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Homelessness","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.549876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.543471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Organization","weight":0.539742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.526731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.461225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Neighbourhood","weight":0.369795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.358033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.225655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Minas Gerais","weight":0.183635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0968837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Child abandonment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abandonment"},{"name":"Peacekeeping","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping"},{"name":"Recklessness (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recklessness_(psychology)"}]}
