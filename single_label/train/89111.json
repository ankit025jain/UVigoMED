{"id":89111,"title":"[Case-control study on therapeutic effects between modified Weaver-Dunn surgery and clavicular hook plate fixation in the treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation].","abstract":"To study therapeutic effects between hook plate fixation and modified Weaver-Dunn surgery for the treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation.Forty patients with fresh acromioclavicular joint dislocations of type III according to Rockwood classification were reviewed. All the patients were divided into two groups: hook plate fixation group and modified surgery group. There were 20 patients in hook plate fixation group, including 13 males and 7 females, with an average age of (37.45 +/- 14.29) years old; 12 patients had injuries in the left and 8 patients had injuries in the right; preoperative Constant-Murley score was 40.75 +/- 10.40. And there were 20 patients in modified surgery group,including 11 males and 9 females, with an average age of (41.65 +/- 14.83) years old; 11 patients had injuries in the left and 9 patients had injuries in the right; preoperative Constant-Murley score was 42.75 +/- 8.18. The Lazzcano standard, Constant-Murley score and imaging changes were used to evaluate shoulder joint function before and after surgery.All the patients were followed up,and the duration ranged from 7 to 32 months,with an average of 24 months. According to Lazzcano evaluation, 16 patients got an excellent result,3 good and 1 poor in modified surgery group with no re-dislocation, and 1 patient had pain more than middle degree; while in hook plate fixation group, 9 patients got an excellent result, 7 good and 4 poor, 1 patient had re-dislocation, and 3 patients got pain more than middle degree. The therapeutic effects of modified surgery group were better than those of hook plate fixation group. Constant-Murley scores:preoperative 42.75 +/- 8.18 vs 93.40 +/- 4.04 at the latest follow-up in modified surgery group; preoperative 40.75 +/- 10.40 vs postoperative 88.40 +/- 4.81 and 92.05 +/- 4.49 at the latest follow-up in hook plate fixation group. The postoperative scores all improved compared to preoperative scores in two groups. And there was no statistical difference of scores at the latest follow-up between two groups.The surgery of allograft tendon transplantation combined with anchor fixation to strengthen coracoclavicular ligament, as well as part transposition of acromiocoracoid ligament and resection at the distal part of clavicle may got safety fixation and less postoperative complications compared with hook plate internal fixation.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24754135","annotations":[{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Clavicle","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.859224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Acromioclavicular joint","weight":0.630976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromioclavicular_joint"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.58328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.410274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"},{"name":"Coracoacromial ligament","weight":0.356138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoacromial_ligament"},{"name":"Separated shoulder","weight":0.301208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separated_shoulder"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.296534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.187836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Coracoclavicular ligament","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoclavicular_ligament"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Anchor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"The Metamorphosis (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis_(The_O.C.)"}]}
