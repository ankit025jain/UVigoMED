{"id":4523,"title":"[Radiological study on the n-HA/PA66 cage used in the transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion].","abstract":"To explore the effects of nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide 66 (n-HA/PA66) cage on recovering and maintaining lumbar curvature, lumbar heights and fusion rate when used in the transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion.From February to July 2012, 50 patients with degenerative lumbar disease(lumbar disc herniation in 32 cases and lumbar spondylolisthesis in 18 cases) were treated with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using the n-HA/PA66 cage, and their preoperative and postoperative clinical outcomes were analyzed. The patients were followed up for 2, 4, 6 and 8 months after operation, during which the CR and CT film of lumbar vertebra were checked to get relative height of vertebral space, Taillard index,index of lumbar spinal curvature,angle of segmental and full lumbar lordosis. The data were analyzed respectively with pair t-test, analysis of variance or LSD-t-test.All the patients were followed up, and the duraion ranged from 8 to 13 months, with a mean of 11.32 months. There were significant differences in relative height of vertebral space, Taillard index, index of lumbar spinal curvature, angle of segmental and full lumbar lordosis after surgery, but there were no significant differences in different periods after operation. The fusion time of lumbar ranged from 4 to 8 months.The n-HA/PA66 cage can recover and maintain lumbar normal stability with higher rate of fusion and less complications.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464590","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.862711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.742218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.740989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.646195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.558698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.436637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.405797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Spondylolisthesis","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylolisthesis"},{"name":"Lordosis","weight":0.209824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordosis"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Lumbar","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0562683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis of variance","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"name":"Topographic prominence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence"},{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Curvature","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature"},{"name":"Cage (enclosure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_(enclosure)"},{"name":"Mexican general election, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_general_election,_2012"},{"name":"Stability","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"},{"name":"Segmentation (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology)"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"}]}
