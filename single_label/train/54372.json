{"id":54372,"title":"High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment of late-stage pancreatic body carcinoma: optimal tumor depth for safe ablation.","abstract":"Objective criteria are currently not available for assessing the extent of ablation by high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). A retrospective review was conducted in Chinese patients with late-stage pancreatic body carcinoma treated with 1 h/d intermittent HIFU at a single center. Clinical and procedure-related characteristics were examined in relation to tumor posterior depth. Clinically, tumor ablation was negatively correlated with posterior tumor depth, with a 1-cm increase in depth decreasing ablation by 30.7%. At a computed tomography (CT)-determined 7-cm posterior tumor depth (considered the critical value for the procedure), ablation sensitivity and specificity were 77.8% and 72.7%, respectively. Tumor ablation >30% in patients with a CT-determined posterior tumor depth ?7 cm was 9.333 times better than that in patients with a CT-determined posterior tumor depth >7 cm. Adverse effects did not affect the efficacy of HIFU. Tumors with posterior depths <7 cm may effectively be treated with HIFU-induced ablation with minimal adverse events.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462161","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.834801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.759622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"High-intensity focused ultrasound","weight":0.73452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_focused_ultrasound"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.280229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.227476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.152012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"China","weight":0.140815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Body of pancreas","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_pancreas"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Hadad","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Critical value","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_value"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"}]}
