{"id":41865,"title":"Management of postoperative bilomas and biliary injuries associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intrabiliary ethanol ablation and micro-coil embolization.","abstract":"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the treatment of choice for gallbladder stones. One of the major complications associated with LC is bile duct injury; ligation or cutting of a bile duct can result in significant segmental biliary obstruction with cholangitis or bile leak, which can progress to bile peritonitis or biliary fistula. Most postoperative bilomas and bile leaks can be treated by percutaneous drainage and decompression of the biliary system by endoscopic stent placement or nasobiliary drainage. When conservative methods fail despite prolonged drainage, selective intrahepatic biliary ethanol and micro-coil embolization may be an alternative treatment. We report three successful cases where postoperative bilomas associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been managed with intrabiliary ethanol ablation and micro-coil embolization.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24895788","annotations":[{"name":"Peritonitis","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritonitis"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.811212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.792364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Jaundice","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.624408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Cholangitis","weight":0.532932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholangitis"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.513024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.510706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ethanol","weight":0.419337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.384057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.311792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.25119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.191043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Biliary fistula","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biliary_fistula"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"}]}
