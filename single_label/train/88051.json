{"id":88051,"title":"[The choice of optimal method of the closure of soft tissue defects in the deep injuries of the extremities].","abstract":"Comparative analysis of the treatment results in 52 patients, suffering deep defects of the coverage tissues of extremities, was done, basing on applying of flaps with temporary and constant nutrent pedicle. The extremity functional state and the patient's quality of life were determined, using SF-36 and EUROQOL-5D questionnaire. The method of plasty, using the flap on a constant nutrient pedicle, have appeared the optimal one for closure of defects in the coverage tissues of the extremities.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923154","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.463144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.262707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.160085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.0546142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
