{"id":77469,"title":"Prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among bank employees in urban Puducherry, India.","abstract":"There is paucity of information on the prevalence of hypertension and its risk factors among bank employees at global level.To assess the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among bank employees in Puducherry, India.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 192 (128 male and 64 female) bank employees from 12 nationalized banks in urban Puducherry, India. Blood pressure was measured and classified according to the Joint National Committee (JNC) VII criteria. Data on risk factors of hypertension, including consumption of extra salt while dining, eating high-salt food, junk food, servings of fruits and vegetables, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and body mass index, were obtained for each participant using a standard questionnaire. Stress level was assessed by Cohen's Perceived Stress scale. Data was analyzed by Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis.The mean±SD age of the participants was 39.5±10.6 years. The prevalence of hypertension and pre-hypertension was 44.3% (95% CI: 37.2%-51.3%) and 41.1% (95% CI: 34.1%-48.1%), respectively. Of 85 participants with hypertension, 47 (55%) was known case and 38 (45%) were newly diagnosed. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that living in the 4th (OR: 3.13) or 6th (OR: 3.11) decade of life, consumption of extra salt (OR: 2.49), and physical activity ?2 hours per day (OR: 0.21) were associated with hypertension among bank employees.Prevalence of hypertension is high among bank employees. There is a need for strengthening adoption of certain interventional measures in lifestyle such as reducing salt intake and promoting physical activity among this vulnerable group.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Occupational
