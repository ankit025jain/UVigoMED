{"id":92154,"title":"Biomechanical testing of a hybrid locking plate fixation of equine sesamoid osteotomies.","abstract":"To compare the biomechanical properties of a hybrid locking compression plate (LCP) construct with the compression screw technique as a treatment for transverse mid-body proximal sesamoid bone fractures.Ten paired forelimbs from abattoir horses were used. The medial proximal sesamoid bone of each limb was osteotomized transversely and randomly assigned, to either repair with a two-hole 3.5 mm LCP or a 4.5 mm cortical screw placed in lag fashion. Each limb was tested biomechanically by axial loading in single cycle until failure. The point of failure was evaluated from the load-displacement curves. Then a gross evaluation and radiographs were performed to identify the mode of failure.The loads to failure of limbs repaired with the hybrid LCP construct (4968 N ± 2167) and the limbs repaired with the screw technique (3009 N ± 1091) were significantly different (p <0.01). The most common mode of failure was through a comminuted fracture of the apical fragment of the proximal sesamoid bone.The LCP technique has potential to achieve a better fracture stability and healing when applied to mid-body fractures of the proximal sesamoid bone. Further testing, particularly fatigue resistance is required to corroborate its potential as a treatment option for mid-body fractures of the proximal sesamoid bone.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441589","annotations":[{"name":"Sesamoid bone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesamoid_bone"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.794813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.659216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.536657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.438568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.260136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Horse","weight":0.252541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.232183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Transverse plane","weight":0.0635195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.0481093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.0424933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Slaughterhouse","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"1091","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1091"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"31st century BC","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31st_century_BC"},{"name":"Stress (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(mechanics)"},{"name":"TRS connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector"},{"name":"Failure causes","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_causes"},{"name":"Mode (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"2160s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2160s"},{"name":"Random assignment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Common-mode signal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-mode_signal"},{"name":"Lag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Fashion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fatigue (material)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(material)"}]}
