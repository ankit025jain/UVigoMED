{"id":18771,"title":"Direct identification of bacteria in positive blood cultures: comparison of two rapid methods, FilmArray and mass spectrometry.","abstract":"We evaluated the accuracy and performance of the FilmArray Direct from Positive Blood Culture system (BCID) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and the VITEK Mass Spectrometry System (Vitek MS; bioMerieux, Durham, NC, USA) to identify bacterial isolates from 161 positive blood culture bottles. The BCID uses multiplex PCR to identify 90-95% of common isolates to the genus or species/complex level as well as mecA, Van A/B, and bla(KPC) genes in approximately 1 hour. Of 151 monomicrobic isolates, the FilmArray correctly identified 48/49 (98%) to the genus and 84/84 (100%) to the species/complex level, while 18/151 (12%) gave no identification, as expected from the database. Mass spectrometry correctly identified 142/151 (94%) monomicrobic cultures to the genus level, 137/151 (91%) to the species level, with only 8/151(5%) giving no identification. Although mass spectrometry has a much larger database, the filtration system was cumbersome in contrast to the 3-5 minutes hands-on-time for the BCID.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767683","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.736901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.697592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.672292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.616127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Salt Lake City","weight":0.551568,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.464734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.457549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.331648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.197796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Durham, North Carolina","weight":0.166553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina"},{"name":"Bottle","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle"},{"name":"Utah","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"North Carolina","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Multiplex polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Van, Turkey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van,_Turkey"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"Air purifier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_purifier"},{"name":"Multiplexing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing"},{"name":"Master of Science","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science"}]}
