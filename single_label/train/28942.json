{"id":28942,"title":"Costs of a motivational enhancement therapy coupled with cognitive behavioral therapy versus brief advice for pregnant substance users.","abstract":"To determine and compare costs of a nurse-administered behavioral intervention for pregnant substance users that integrated motivational enhancement therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy (MET-CBT) to brief advice (BA) administered by an obstetrical provider. Both interventions were provided concurrent with prenatal care.We conducted a micro-costing study that prospectively collected detailed resource utilization and unit cost data for each of the two intervention arms (MET-CBT and BA) within the context of a randomized controlled trial. A three-step approach for identifying, measuring and valuing resource utilization was used. All cost estimates were inflation adjusted to 2011 U.S. dollars.A total of 82 participants received the MET-CBT intervention and 86 participants received BA. From the societal perspective, the total cost (including participants' time cost) of the MET-CBT intervention was $120,483 or $1,469 per participant. In contrast, the total cost of the BA intervention was $27,199 or $316 per participant. Personnel costs (nurse therapists and obstetric providers) for delivering the intervention sessions and supervising the program composed the largest share of the MET-CBT intervention costs. Program set up costs, especially intervention material design and training costs, also contributed substantially to the overall cost.Implementation of an MET-CBT program to promote drug abstinence in pregnant women is associated with modest costs. Future cost effectiveness and cost benefit analyses integrating costs with outcomes and benefits data will enable a more comprehensive understanding of the intervention in improving the care of substance abusing pregnant women.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760017","annotations":[{"name":"Cognitive behavioral therapy","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.793129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.725549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Motivation","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.479993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.399255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.397453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Prenatal care","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_care"},{"name":"Bachelor of Arts","weight":0.274118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.256917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Inflation","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation"},{"name":"Cost-benefit analysis","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis"},{"name":"Domestic violence","weight":0.118004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Behaviour therapy","weight":0.0628681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_therapy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cost-effectiveness analysis","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-effectiveness_analysis"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Abstinence","weight":0.018968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
