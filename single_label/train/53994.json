{"id":53994,"title":"Improved survival among patients with complicated type 2 diabetes in Denmark: a prospective study (2002-2010).","abstract":"It is unclear to what extent recent advances in diabetes care have reduced the excess mortality in patients with complicated type 2 diabetes.The aim of this study was to estimate time trends in mortality among patients with complicated type 2 diabetes at the Steno Diabetes Center relative to the general Danish background population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND STUDY PARTICIPANTS: We performed a longitudinal follow-up study from 2002 to 2010 of 5844 patients with type 2 diabetes at the Steno Diabetes Center, Denmark. All-cause and cause-specific mortality was identified from the national death register.Poisson regression was used to model mortality rates by sex, age, age of diabetes onset, and calendar time.A total of 1341 deaths occurred (802 men and 539 women) during 32,913 person-years of follow-up. Total mortality rates in the diabetes population decreased by 5.5% (95% confidence interval 2.9%-8.0%) per year in men and by 3.3% (0.0%-6.4%) per year in women. Among men but not women, this decline was significantly steeper than the decline in mortality in the Danish background population (men, -3.0% [-5.6% to -0.4%]; women, -1.4 [-4.6% to 2.0%]). The decline in overall mortality was explained by a decline in cardiovascular mortality for both men and women.Overall and cardiovascular mortality have decreased during the last decade among Danish patients with complicated type 2 diabetes, and for men, the decline in mortality was more pronounced than in the general population.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483155","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.886823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.760555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.695352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.682679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.476424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.318978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Calendar","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar"},{"name":"Rough-toothed dolphin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough-toothed_dolphin"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Steno Diabetes Center","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steno_Diabetes_Center"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Calendar date","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_date"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"802","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"1341","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1341"},{"name":"913","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/913"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Ordination of women","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination_of_women"},{"name":"Decade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Register (sociolinguistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
