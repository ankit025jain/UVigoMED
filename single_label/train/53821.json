{"id":53821,"title":"Biochemical and radiological relationships in patients with pheochromocytoma: lessons from a case control study.","abstract":"An elevation of fractionated plasma or urinary metanephrine (MN) or nor-metanephrine (NMN), collectively called metanephrines (MN and NMN), >4-fold above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is usually considered to be diagnostic for pheochromocytoma (PHEO). There are a greater number of false positive results when the elevations are more modest.To identify biochemical and radiological features in PHEOs with modest elevations (<4-fold above ULN) of metanephrines.We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 112 patients with PHEO (10% extra-adrenal) and 208 patients with a non-PHEO adrenal mass operated from 1997-2011, who had metanephrines measured pre-operatively. We divided PHEO into group 1 (n = 90) with metanephrines ?4-fold ULN and group 2 (n = 22) with metanephrines <4-fold ULN. The non-PHEO group was designated as group 3.The median (range) tumour size in group 1 and group 2 was 4·8 cm (1·7-22) and 3·0 cm (1·7-5) respectively (P < 0·001). All patients with PHEO in group 2 had a tumour <5 cm in size. The MN fraction was elevated in about 65% of groups 1 and 2; only 2 (1%) patients in group 3 had an elevated urinary MN fraction, and none were associated with an elevated plasma MN fraction. All PHEOs had a pre-contrast attenuation ?17 Hounsfield Units (HU).Modest elevations (<4-fold ULN) of the NMN fraction in an adrenal mass >5 cm are almost always falsely positive. Elevations in plasma and urinary MN fraction are less likely to be false positive. The CT pre-contrast attenuation of PHEOs is >10 HU.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494743","annotations":[{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.700903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.646195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.397996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.390125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Pheochromocytoma","weight":0.38724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.335411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"False positive","weight":0.291579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Metanephrine","weight":0.257569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanephrine"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.221817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Hounsfield scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounsfield_scale"},{"name":"Normetanephrine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normetanephrine"},{"name":"Blood plasma fractionation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma_fractionation"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Hungary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"},{"name":"Minnesota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"1722","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1722"},{"name":"208","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/208"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Nomeansno","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomeansno"},{"name":"Case-control study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Range (particle radiation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(particle_radiation)"},{"name":"Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modest_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky"},{"name":"Godfrey Hounsfield","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_Hounsfield"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
