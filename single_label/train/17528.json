{"id":17528,"title":"Adherence in the treatment of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV in South Africa: a prospective cohort study.","abstract":"Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB)/HIV coinfection is difficult to treat with frequent adverse drug reactions and associated with high mortality. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ARV) and second-line TB medications may reduce mortality, prevent amplification of drug resistance, and improve outcomes.Prospective cohort study of XDR-TB patients on treatment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Adherence to ARV and TB medications was assessed separately at baseline and monthly. Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were assessed at baseline. Optimal adherence was defined as self-report of taking all pills in the previous 7 days; missing any pills was defined as suboptimal adherence. Primary outcome was optimal adherence 6 months after initiation of XDR-TB treatment to TB medications, ARV, and both (\"dual adherence\").One hundred four XDR-TB patients (79.8% HIV coinfected, 84.3% on ARV at enrollment) were enrolled and followed monthly (median 8 visits; interquartile range: 4-12). Six-month optimal adherence was higher for ARV (88.2%) than TB medications (67.7%) (P < 0.001). Low educational attainment, male gender, and year of enrollment were independently associated with dual suboptimal adherence. At baseline, participants indicated that XDR-TB was curable (76.0%), HIV and TB were linked (81.7%), and ARV improves TB outcomes (72.1%). Baseline knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs did not predict subsequent adherence.Medication adherence was significantly higher for ARV than for TB medications in this cohort. Short-course treatment regimens for drug-resistant TB with lower pill burden may increase adherence and improve outcomes in XDR-TB/HIV. Programmatic support for dual adherence is critical in the treatment of drug-resistant TB and HIV.","date":"2014-08-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872138","annotations":[{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"South Africa","weight":0.810842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.809779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.682824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.64351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.642762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.537563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.526826,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.509317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"KwaZulu-Natal","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.442027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Polypharmacy","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypharmacy"},{"name":"Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis","weight":0.222756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensively_drug-resistant_tuberculosis"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Pill (pharmacy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Coinfection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinfection"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"HIV/AIDS in South Africa","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_South_Africa"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
