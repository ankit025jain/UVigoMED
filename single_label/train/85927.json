{"id":85927,"title":"Evaluation of automated attenuation-based tube potential selection in combination with organ-specific dose reduction for contrast-enhanced chest CT examinations.","abstract":"To evaluate the influence of attenuation-based tube potential selection (ATPS) in combination with organ-specific dose reduction (OSDR) on radiation dose and image quality of contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) examinations.Seventy consecutive patients (59.2 ± 16.1 years; 49 men; 21 women) were randomized into two groups and underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT using a 128 section CT scanner. CT examinations were performed as standard protocol in group A (n = 35) and with the activated novel dose-saving devices, OSDR and ATPS, in group B (n = 35). Objective [signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)] and subjective image quality (five-point scale; 1 = non diagnostic; 5 = excellent) as well as radiation dose (CTDIvol) were analysed.CTDIvol of the protocol using OSDR and ATPS was significantly lower than in standard chest CT examinations (3.4 ± 1 versus 6.1 ± 2.3 mGy; p < 0.001). Although the level of noise was slightly elevated in group B (14.1 ± 1.7 versus 11.4 ± 1.9 HU; p < 0.01), no significant differences in SNR (17.1 ± 5 versus 16.3 ± 4.7) or subjective image quality (mean score of 4.6 versus 4.4) were observed between both imaging protocols.Attenuation-based tube potential selection in combination with organ-specific dose reduction essentially reduces the dose of chest CT in patients with normal body mass index (BMI) in clinical routine while maintaining subjective and objective image quality.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Respiratory Tract
