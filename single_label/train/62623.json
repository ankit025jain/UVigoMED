{"id":62623,"title":"Arm lymphoedema after axillary surgery in women with invasive breast cancer.","abstract":"The primary aim was to compare arm lymphoedema after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in women with node-negative and node-positive breast cancer. The secondary aim was to examine the potential association between self-reported and objectively measured arm lymphoedema.Women who had surgery during 1999-2004 for invasive breast cancer in four centres in Sweden were included. The study groups were defined by the axillary procedure performed and the presence of axillary metastases: SLNB alone, ALND without axillary metastases, and ALND with axillary metastases. Before surgery, and 1, 2 and 3?years after operation, arm volume was measured and a questionnaire regarding symptoms of arm lymphoedema was completed. A mixed model was used to determine the adjusted mean difference in arm volume between the study groups, and generalized estimating equations were employed to determine differences in self-reported arm lymphoedema.One hundred and forty women had SLNB alone, 125 had node-negative ALND and 155 node-positive ALND. Women who underwent SLNB had no increase in postoperative arm volume over time, whereas both ALND groups showed a significant increase. The risk of self-reported arm lymphoedema 1, 2 and 3?years after surgery was significantly lower in the SLNB group compared with that in both ALND groups. Three years after surgery there was a significant association between increased arm volume and self-reported symptoms of arm lymphoedema.SLNB is associated with a minimal risk of increased arm volume and few symptoms of arm lymphoedema, significantly less than after ALND, regardless of lymph node status.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24536010","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Lymphedema","weight":0.743283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphedema"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.632144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.57298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Axillary lymph nodes","weight":0.454135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axillary_lymph_nodes"},{"name":"Sweden","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Axilla","weight":0.110231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axilla"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.0815385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Mixed model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model"},{"name":"Estimating equations","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimating_equations"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Sentinel (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_(comics)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Estimation theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory"},{"name":"Mean difference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_difference"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"}]}
