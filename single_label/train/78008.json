{"id":78008,"title":"A boy with mild mental retardation, mild sensorineural hearing loss and mild facial dysmorphism caused by a 19p13.2 deletion: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"The investigation of patients with congenital anomalies and/or intellectual disability with modern genetic methods allows the recognition of an increasing number of cases with these chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we present a mildly mentally retarded boy with mild facial dysmorphism, language development delay, mild sensorineural hearing loss due to a deletion of 1,14 Mb on chromosome 19p 13.2. The deletion was de novo and familial history negative for this disorder. To our knowledge this is the first description of a patient with symptoms mentioned above associated with a 19p13.2-p13.2 deletion.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814572","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Mental retardation","weight":0.830255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_retardation"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Sensorineural hearing loss","weight":0.648901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.634744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.575476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.512882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.509952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.409786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.380684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.269972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Language development","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_development"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.130186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Dysmorphic feature","weight":0.121183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmorphic_feature"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Chromosome 19 (human)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_19_(human)"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Intelligence","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence"},{"name":"De novo","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_novo"}]}
