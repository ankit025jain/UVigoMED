{"id":70886,"title":"[Expression of G-CSFR IV isoform in adult acute myeloid leukemia and its clinical significance].","abstract":"This study was aimed to investigate the expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor IV(G-CSFR IV) in adult acute leukemia patients and its clinical significance. The bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells from healthy persons were used as controls. The real-time RT-PCR was used to determine the expression level of G-CSFR I-IV in 99 AML, 34 ALL patients and 19 healthy persons. The results showed that the relative expression level of G-CSFR IV/G-CSFR I in AML patients was obviously elevated, as compared with that in ALL patients and controls, while the relative expression level of G-CSFR IV/G-CSFR I in ALL patients showed no statistical difference from controls. The analysis of clinical features and chemotherapeutic efficacy demonstrated that the clinical remission rate in patients with high expression of G-CSFR IV/G-CSFR I was lower than that in patients with low expression. The relative expression level of G-CSFR IV/G-CSFR I was not related with risk stratification from sex, age, blast ratio, FAB typing, chromosome and fusion gene. It is concluded that the abnormal high expression of G-CSFR IV relates with poor prognosis of AML.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130800","annotations":[{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Fusion gene","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_gene"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.761812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.729067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.709046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.669087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.464585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.390916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.357838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"French-American-British classification","weight":0.148225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French-American-British_classification"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"}]}
