{"id":84138,"title":"Deletion of prostaglandin E2 synthesizing enzymes in brain endothelial cells attenuates inflammatory fever.","abstract":"Fever is a hallmark of inflammatory and infectious diseases. The febrile response is triggered by prostaglandin E2 synthesis mediated by induced expression of the enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (mPGES-1). The cellular source for pyrogenic PGE2 remains a subject of debate; several hypotheses have been forwarded, including immune cells in the periphery and in the brain, as well as the brain endothelium. Here we generated mice with selective deletion of COX-2 and mPGES1 in brain endothelial cells. These mice displayed strongly attenuated febrile responses to peripheral immune challenge. In contrast, inflammation-induced hypoactivity was unaffected, demonstrating the physiological selectivity of the response to the targeted gene deletions. These findings demonstrate that PGE2 synthesis in brain endothelial cells is critical for inflammation-induced fever.
