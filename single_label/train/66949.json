{"id":66949,"title":"ABLATE: a renal ablation planning algorithm.","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to present the ABLATE renal ablation planning algorithm (Table 1), which is based on anatomic renal tumor characteristics critical to ablation. [Table: see text].ABLATE provides a systematic method for reviewing cross-sectional imaging of renal masses for ablation planning purposes. The goal of this system is to help proceduralists anticipate and manage potential technical challenges of renal ablations to maximize oncologic outcomes and minimize complications.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660722","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.710232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.618237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.545849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.38272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Automated planning and scheduling","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Superconducting magnetic energy storage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_magnetic_energy_storage"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"}]}
