{"id":70104,"title":"Nevus-associated melanomas: clinicopathologic features.","abstract":"The clinical significance of nevus-associated melanoma compared with de novo melanomas remains controversial. It has been suggested that nevus-associated melanomas have a higher Breslow thickness and therefore worse prognosis. Over a 10-year period, this study evaluated the incidence of nevus-associated melanoma and its prognostic significance related to clinicopathologic features.Cross-sectional study from 1995 through 2004 in a dermatopathology referral center. With available data, we evaluated sex, primary location, histologic subtype, Breslow thickness, Clark level, presence of ulceration, associated lesion, and histologic subtype of the associated lesion.Of 135,653 pathologic records from skin biopsy specimens over a 10-year period, 1,190 melanoma records were selected. Nevus-associated melanomas corresponded to 390 (32.8%) melanomas, with thin melanomas having a nevus 1.52 times the association observed with thick melanomas (>1.01 mm; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.99; P < .001). Superficial spreading melanoma was the most frequent, while no lentigo maligna melanoma was associated with nevi. The median Breslow thickness of nevus-associated melanomas was lower than that of de novo melanomas.Nevus-associated melanomas, which represent one-third of the melanomas in southeast Brazil, are associated with intermittent sun exposure, superficial spreading melanomas, and lower Breslow thickness. This is one of the largest series describing nevus-associated melanomas in Latin America.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239415","annotations":[{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.830629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.809335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.767467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Skin biopsy","weight":0.736455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_biopsy"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.726497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.617472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.567336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Latin America","weight":0.419897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"},{"name":"Sunburn","weight":0.389409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburn"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.358882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.301841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Lentigo maligna melanoma","weight":0.215579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentigo_maligna_melanoma"},{"name":"Dermatopathology","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatopathology"},{"name":"Nevus","weight":0.208121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevus"},{"name":"Lentigo","weight":0.189045,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentigo"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Superficial spreading melanoma","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superficial_spreading_melanoma"},{"name":"Lentigo maligna","weight":0.0435896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentigo_maligna"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
