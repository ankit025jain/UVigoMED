{"id":61103,"title":"[Expression and clinical significance of miR-21 in diffuse large B cell lymphoma].","abstract":"This study was aimed to investigate the expression of microRNA-21 and its correlation with PTEN in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) paraffin-embedded tissues, and evaluate its potential relevance with clinical characteristics. The expression levels of miR-21 in 26 primary DLBCL and 10 normal lymph node tissue specimens were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of PTEN was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The results indicated that the expression of miR-21 was significantly higher in tumor tissues [6.586(1.10,38.22)] than that in normal tissues [0.791 (0.35,2.87)] (P < 0.05). Among 26 patients with DLBCL the expression of PTEN protein was positive in 6 patients (23%), and was negative in 20 patients (77%). In patients with DLBCL, the expression level of miR-21 was negatively correlated with the level of PTEN protein. The high expression of miR-21 was positively correlated with the level of serum LDH. The expression level of miR-21 in patients with Ann Arbor III-IV stage was obviously higher than that of patients with Ann Arbor I-II stage, but did not correlate with the subtype of patients in clinic (P > 0.05). It is concluded that the expression of miR-21 is high in DLBCL and its overexpression may be related with poor prognosis of DLCBL. These findings suggest that PTEN is possibly one of the targets of miR-21 in DLBCL.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24763002","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.689941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.655992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.488739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.431438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.389178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.349522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.32212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.114558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Ann Arbor, Michigan","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
