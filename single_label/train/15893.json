{"id":15893,"title":"Utilization of ethyl cyanoacrylate and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate adhesives for autogenous bone graft fixation: histomorphometric study in rats.","abstract":"The present study analyzes the repair process of autogenous bone graft in a block fixed with ethyl cyanoacrylate and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate adhesives in rat calvaria. Forty-eight rats, divided into 3 groups, received round osteotomies at the right parietal bone for the attainment of autogenous bone graft fragment, which was fixed at the opposite side to the donor site with ethyl cyanoacrylate (ethyl group) and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (octyl group) adhesives. In the control group, bone fragment was only juxtaposed at the parietal bone surface without any fixation material. The animals were euthanized after 10 and 60 postoperative days. The calvariae were processed in a laboratory for the attainment of slides stained through the hematoxylin and eosin technique for histological and histometric analysis. The qualitative analysis showed a discrete inflammatory infiltrate in the control group and moderate inflammatory infiltrate in the ethyl and octyl groups at the 10-day period, which remained at the 60-day period, mainly in the octyl group. The bone fragment remained bonded to the recipient site through the adhesive, but graft incorporation was not observed in any of the specimens. Resorption was higher in the octyl group followed by the ethyl and control groups, both at the 10- and 60-day periods, but with no statistical significance (P < .05). Although promoting graft fixation and its maintenance at the recipient site, both studied adhesives did not allow the graft incorporation, producing a localized and discrete inflammatory reaction, which persisted at 60 days, being more intense in the octyl cyanoacrylate group.
