{"id":44726,"title":"Polymorphisms of interferon gamma gene and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Korean patients with chronic hepatitis B viral infection.","abstract":"Increasing evidence supports the contribution of the pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance and genetic factors to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated whether genetic interferon gamma polymorphisms were associated with HCC in Korean patients with chronic hepatitis B.We genotyped a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs2430561, +874A/T) and a microsatellite (rs3138557, (CA) (n) repeat), located in the first intron of the interferon gamma gene, by direct sequencing and the gene scan method. A population-based case-control study of HCC was conducted and included 170 patients with chronic hepatitis and HCC, and 171 with chronic hepatitis B patients without hepatocellular carcinoma in a Korean population.Genotype and allele distributions of the interferon gamma gene SNP were associated with HCC. The frequencies of the AA genotype and the A allele were significantly increased in hepatocellular carcinoma subjects (p < 0.05). Combined analysis using the genotype of rs2430561 and the number of microsatellites revealed that the frequencies of AT-CA12, and TT-CA12 increased significantly in hepatocellular carcinoma subjects (p < 0.0001).Our results suggest that the interferon gamma gene may be a susceptibility gene and a risk factor for HCC in the Korean population.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719951","annotations":[{"name":"Intron","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Interferon-gamma","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon-gamma"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Microsatellite (genetics)","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Gamma ray","weight":0.0703685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"}]}
