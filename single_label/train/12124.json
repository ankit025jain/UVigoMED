{"id":12124,"title":"The comparison of sensitivity of motion sickness between retinal degeneration fast mice and normal mice.","abstract":"Recent studies report that a conflict between information from the visual system and vestibular system is one of the main reasons for induction of motion sickness (MS). We may be able to clarify the integration mechanism of visual and vestibular information using an animal model with a visual defect, the retinal degeneration fast (rdf) mouse, and the role of vestibular information in the pathogenesis of MS. The rdf mice and wild-type Kunming mice were subjected to rotary stimulation to induce MS. Conditioned taste anorexia to saccharin solution and behavior score were used to observe the differences in MS sensitivity between two types of mice. The decrease in intake of saccharin solution and the behavior score in rdf mice were greater than those in normal mice. After rotatory stimulation, the reduction of intake mass and the behavior score were greater in rdf mice compared to those of normal mice. The rdf mice were more sensitive to rotation than normal mice. We conclude that visual information plays a role in the pathogenesis of MS. Visual information and vestibular information impact each other and integrate through certain channels in the central nervous system in mice.
