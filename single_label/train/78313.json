{"id":78313,"title":"Investigational drugs for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.","abstract":"Allergic rhinitis is characterized by paroxysms of sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction. Its prevalence is increasing in industrialized countries worldwide and imposes a significant economic burden as a result of reduced school performance, work productivity and medical expenses. Allergic rhinitis impairs the quality of life of those affected, and current treatment regimens are inadequate for those whose symptoms are severe or refractory to standard drug therapies. They mainly include symptom control with intranasal glucocorticoids, oral and intranasal antihistamines.This article provides a review of the most current literature on research that has focused on improving the efficacy of current treatment regimens and developing new drugs. It also provides the reader with an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis, including the inflammatory mediators and cell types involved, which has led to novel treatment options that are under investigation. These new drugs aim to alter the immunologic response to allergens in order to achieve greater clinical efficacy.It is our opinion that despite developments in new therapies, a multidrug approach is vital for successful treatment of allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, immunotherapy in the form of sublingual immunotherapy is a promising additional therapeutic approach that will potentially make immunotherapy available to a wider selection of eligible patients with allergic rhinitis.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
