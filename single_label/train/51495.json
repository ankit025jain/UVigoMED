{"id":51495,"title":"[Clinical features of familial non-medullary thyroid cancer patients].","abstract":"To analyze the clinical features of familial non-medullary thyroid cancers, and to discuss their management.Sixty thyroid cancer patients with familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) history during Sep. 2003 to Sep. 2012 were collected as study group, and another 60 sporadic thyroid cancer patients were randomly chosen as control. We compared the differences of their clinical features.All the patients were diagnosed as thyroid papillary carcinoma. The study group included 40 female and 20 male patients. There were 16 cases in stage T1, 37 in stage T3, and 7 in stage T4. The patients were 21-66-year old ( median age 42-years). The control group included 49 female and 11 male patients. The patients were 24- to 78-year old, and the median age was 45.5 years. 43.3% of the patients in the study group and 18.3% of the patients in the control group had bilateral carcinomas (P = 0.003). There were multifocal lesions in 53.3% of the patients in the study group and 35.0% of the control group, local invasion in 73.3% of the patients in the study group and 55.0% of the control group, and coexisting benign thyroid diseases in 81.7% of the patients of the study group and 50.0% of the control group (P < 0.05 for all). There were cervical lymph node metastases in 60.0% of the patients in the study group and 38.3% in the control group (P = 0.018). In the study group, 32 cases were of parent-offspring type and 28 cases of sibling type. Among the parent-offspring type patients, the median onset age of the first generation offsprings was 58 years, and that of the second generation offsprings was 32 years (P < 0.001).Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer, especially in parent-offspring type patients, is more aggressive than sporadic nonmedullary thyroid cancer, and often involves bilateral lobes, has multifocality, and combines with benign thyroid diseases. We recommend a total thyroidectomy for treatment, and to screen all the family members >20 years old, with ultrasonography for early diagnosis and treatment.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24685091","annotations":[{"name":"Thyroidectomy","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroidectomy"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.804589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.803027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.777439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.629198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.605951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Papillary thyroid cancer","weight":0.55757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.555832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.488739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Triiodothyronine","weight":0.070741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"},{"name":"Thyroid disease","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_disease"},{"name":"Thyroxine","weight":0.0344035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Thoracic vertebrae","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae"},{"name":"Generation","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation"},{"name":"Bilateral symmetry","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_symmetry"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Sibling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
