{"id":84815,"title":"[Recurrent implantation failure: gamete and embryo factors].","abstract":"Despite the immense achievement in the field of IVF in recent years, many patients still suffer from recurrent implantation failure. Therefore, much attention has been drawn to its etiology and treatment. Chromosomal abnormality, sperm DNA damage, zona hardening, and inappropriate culture conditions are important factors that lead to recurrent implantation failure. Results of studies suggest that preimplantation genetic screening does not improve the rate of implantation or live birth. Comparative genomic hybridization array and single nucleotide polymorphism array could offer a more comprehensive screening of chromosomes. Assisted hatching may help to solve the problem of zona hardening in some situations. Co-culture and blastocyst transfer could be conducive to the improvement of the rates of implantation and pregnancy. Cytoplasmic transfer may give a solution to ooplasmic composition anomalies.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029863","annotations":[{"name":"Chromosome abnormality","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality"},{"name":"Gamete","weight":0.88473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Blastocyst","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.862887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"In vitro fertilisation","weight":0.831245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Genomics","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Implantation (human embryo)","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantation_(human_embryo)"},{"name":"Comparative genomic hybridization","weight":0.662401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_genomic_hybridization"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.623933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.566554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.55184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.396339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"DNA damage","weight":0.320392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.271842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.0175647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Vivipary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivipary"}]}
