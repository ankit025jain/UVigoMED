{"id":30917,"title":"The dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist YQA14 that inhibits the expression and drug-prime reactivation of morphine-induced conditioned place preference in rats.","abstract":"Increasing evidence suggests that the mesolimbic dopamine system plays a critical role in opioid addiction. However, there is currently no standard drug treatment for opioid addiction. Growing preclinical evidence indicates that the dopamine D(3) receptor antagonists are the potential anti-addiction pharmacotherapeutic agents based on animal models of multiple drug addiction. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of YQA14, a novel dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist with a high affinity and selectivity for dopamine D(3) receptor, using morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. The results suggested that YQA14 (6.25-25 mg/kg; intraperitoneal, i.p.) decreased the expression of morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced CPP in a dose-related manner but did not influence the acquisition of morphine-induced CPP. At a 25 mg/kg dose of YQA14, it also notably inhibited the reactivation of morphine-priming CPP. These findings suggest that YQA14 is a potential agent for anti-opioid addiction which warrants further study and development.","date":"2014-01-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24436985","annotations":[{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Opioid","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.77358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Animal model","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_model"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Dopamine receptor D3","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D3"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Mesolimbic pathway","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolimbic_pathway"},{"name":"Affinity (pharmacology)","weight":0.632953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.621221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Opioid dependence","weight":0.616108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_dependence"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Antagonist","weight":0.603633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Classical conditioning","weight":0.352618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.283971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Subcutaneous injection","weight":0.152786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection"},{"name":"Conditioned place preference","weight":0.139423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditioned_place_preference"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Drug development","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}]}
