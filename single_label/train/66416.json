{"id":66416,"title":"Kidney protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury by myofibrillogenesis regulator-1.","abstract":"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is characterized by cytoskeletal reorganization and loss of polarity in proximal tubule epithelial cells. Previously, we showed that myofibrillogenesis regulator (MR)-1 promoted actin organization in cardiomyocytes. MR-1 is also expressed in the kidney.In this study, we investigated MR-1 expression in acute renal failure induced by I/R in Sprague-Dawley rats. We determined the MR-1 expression and the ratio of fibrous actin (F-actin) to globular actin (G-actin). HK-2 cells were treated with or without hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), and MR-1 levels were increased by adenoviral overexpression or silenced by RNA interference.I/R and H/R resulted in cellular injury and decreases of MR-1, the F-/G-actin ratio, and myosin light chain (MLC)-2. MR-1 overexpression attenuated H/R-induced cell injury and loss of surface membrane polarity of actin. MR-1 overexpression also increased the expression and phosphorylation of MLC-2 and MLC kinase, which were decreased in MR-1-silenced and H/R-treated cells.Together, these data show that MR-1 promoted actin polarity on the membrane surface and protected HK-2 cells from H/R injury. The mechanism might involve the rapid organization of F-actin through the upregulation and phosphorylation of MLC-2.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714450","annotations":[{"name":"RNA interference","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference"},{"name":"Actin","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin"},{"name":"Myosin","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosin"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.812028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.781748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cytoskeleton","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoskeleton"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Adenoviridae","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Chemical polarity","weight":0.621707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_polarity"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.602214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Proximal convoluted tubule","weight":0.557917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_convoluted_tubule"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.39545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.36328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Globular protein","weight":0.359055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_protein"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.288149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Tubule","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubule"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin light chain","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0214857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"}]}
