{"id":51841,"title":"Care of type 2 diabetes in unresourced general practice: current practice in the Mid-West.","abstract":"It is estimated that 4.5% of the Irish population have type 2 diabetes. The HSE intends to move the care of uncomplicated type 2 diabetes to General Practice (GP). The study reviewed current General Practice diabetes care in the Irish Mid-West. The files of randomly selected patients from 12 GP teaching practices attached to the University of Limerick were audited. 842 patients were identified (62% male, 38% female). The mean age was 66 years. 75% were GMS patients. A practice protocol was used in 71% of patients. Average Cholesterol (4.3 mmol/l), creatinine (85.3 mmol/l), HbA1c (56.7 mmol/mol) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (134 mmHg) measurements were well documented and controlled. However the rates of and mean intervals for foot review (60.2%), BMI measurement (52.3%), retinopathy screening (62.0%) and influenza vaccination (63.0%) were unacceptably low. Current management of type 2 diabetes in unresourced general practices is suboptimal although some biochemical parameters are well controlled.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654481","annotations":[{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.784929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.723718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.710287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.676915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.662401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.570603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.403481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.320833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.301974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"Influenza vaccine","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.270553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.269419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.196135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.111393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.107346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.0825297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0473969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0320573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Limerick","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick"},{"name":"University of Limerick","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Limerick"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Computer file","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"842","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/842"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Irish people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Mid West (Western Australia)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_West_(Western_Australia)"},{"name":"Schlaich Bergermann & Partner","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlaich_Bergermann_&_Partner"}]}
