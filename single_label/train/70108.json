{"id":70108,"title":"Transforming growth factor ?-mediated suppression of antitumor T cells requires FoxP1 transcription factor expression.","abstract":"Tumor-reactive T cells become unresponsive in advanced tumors. Here we have characterized a common mechanism of T cell unresponsiveness in cancer driven by the upregulation of the transcription factor Forkhead box protein P1 (Foxp1), which prevents CD8? T cells from proliferating and upregulating Granzyme-B and interferon-? in response to tumor antigens. Accordingly, Foxp1-deficient lymphocytes induced rejection of incurable tumors and promoted protection against tumor rechallenge. Mechanistically, Foxp1 interacted with the transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3 in preactivated CD8? T cells in response to microenvironmental transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), and was essential for its suppressive activity. Therefore, Smad2 and Smad3-mediated c-Myc repression requires Foxp1 expression in T cells. Furthermore, Foxp1 directly mediated TGF-?-induced c-Jun transcriptional repression, which abrogated T cell activity. Our results unveil a fundamental mechanism of T cell unresponsiveness different from anergy or exhaustion, driven by TGF-? signaling on tumor-associated lymphocytes undergoing Foxp1-dependent transcriptional regulation.","date":"2014-09-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25238097","annotations":[{"name":"Myc","weight":0.914388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.836623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.827099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2","weight":0.800454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothers_against_decapentaplegic_homolog_2"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.744719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3","weight":0.737514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothers_against_decapentaplegic_homolog_3"},{"name":"CD8","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD8"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cytotoxic T cell","weight":0.709663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Clonal anergy","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonal_anergy"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.581894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.363121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Repressor","weight":0.338047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressor"},{"name":"FOX proteins","weight":0.336452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOX_proteins"},{"name":"SMAD (protein)","weight":0.318153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMAD_(protein)"},{"name":"Transcriptional regulation","weight":0.270845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_regulation"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.269966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Coma","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0863578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Adenosine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_receptor"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}]}
