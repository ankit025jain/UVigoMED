{"id":90707,"title":"Support for partial lesions of the flexor tendons of the fingers: a retrospective study of 36 cases.","abstract":"The treatment of traumatic partial injuries of the flexor tendons of the fingers is seldom published. The only published clinical series states that the therapeutic approach depends on the existence or absence of a preoperative trigger. We hypothesized that the therapeutic attitude mainly depends on the percentage of the injured cross-section. Our retrospective series included 36 partial lesions of 31 fingers in 29 patients. The average age was 42 years, there were 19 men. We noted 8 lesions in zones I, 21 in zone II and 2 in zone III. The average percentage of the injured cross-section was 35% and ranged from 10% to 90%. If the lesion was less than 50% (29 tendons), a tangential resection was performed. If the lesion exceeded 50% (seven tendons), a direct suture was performed, supplemented by a running suture. At a follow-up of 34 months, the average pain on a visual analogue scale was 0.7. The average percentage of strength compared to the contralateral side was 93%. The Quick DASH score was 6.2. The range of motion averaged 214° with extremes ranging from 90° to 260°. We observed no cases of hypertrophic callus, neither through the MRI nor through the ultrasonography. Complications such as trigger finger, pseudoblocage or rupture were not observed. Based on our results, in case of partial injury of a flexor tendon, we propose to perform a tangential resection in cross-section lesions up to 50%, and a suture for those which exceeded 50%.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582157","annotations":[{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.785244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.737689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.662436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.43674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.295631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.237582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.197202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0347418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.026362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Tangent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent"},{"name":"260","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/260"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Trigger finger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_finger"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Trigger (firearms)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)"},{"name":"Annular ligaments of fingers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_ligaments_of_fingers"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"The Quick (US band)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quick_(US_band)"}]}
