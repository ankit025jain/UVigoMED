{"id":68972,"title":"Bladder and bowel symptoms in cervical and endometrial cancer survivors.","abstract":"Previous studies likely underestimate the prevalence of bowel and bladder symptoms in gynecologic cancer survivors. We sought to estimate the prevalence of these symptoms in cervical and endometrial cancer survivors who had completed treatment 1?year previously compared with non-cancer controls, and to examine factors associated with more severe symptoms in survivors.As part of a larger quality of life study, survivors who were 1-year posttreatment for cervical or endometrial cancer (n?=?104) completed measures of bladder and bowel symptoms. An age-matched and race/ethnicity-matched sample of women with no history of cancer was recruited for comparison purposes.Survivors reported a higher prevalence of bladder symptoms, specifically storage and incontinence symptoms, than non-cancer controls. Prevalence rates for bowel symptoms in survivors were higher than those reported in previous studies. Greater symptom severity was associated with younger age, lower annual incomes, and less education. Other correlates included higher body mass index and history of smoking. As hypothesized, more severe symptoms were associated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic radiation.Bladder and bowel symptoms are more prevalent in cervical and endometrial cancer survivors than non-cancer controls. Future research should replicate these findings in a larger, prospective study.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481859","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.862063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.680243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.657598,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.574672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.287979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Endometrial cancer","weight":0.269444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_cancer"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.111487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Gynecologic oncology","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecologic_oncology"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Cancer survivor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
