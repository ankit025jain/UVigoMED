{"id":37316,"title":"[De Vivo disease. GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome: a case report].","abstract":"GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome is a rare genetic disease where the specific glucose transporter through the brain barrier is deficient. GLUT-1 deficiency causes an array of symptoms that may vary considerably from one patient to another. Signs and symptoms may include seizures, movement disorders, speech and language disorders, and developmental delays. We report a case of an infant who presented myoclonic events often occurring prior to meals, associated with developmental delay. The diagnosis was made before the discovery of hypoglycorrhachia associated with normal plasma glucose, proven biochemically by DNA analysis. Treatment with a ketogenic diet proved to be successful in controlling the epilepsy.
