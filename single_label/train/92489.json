{"id":92489,"title":"Asymmetry of the knee extension deficit in standing affects weight-bearing distribution in patients with bilateral end-stage knee osteoarthritis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate weight-bearing distribution in patients with bilateral end-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to clarify the gait parameters affecting the weight-bearing distribution during both standing and walking using gait analysis.Twenty-five patients (averaged 71 years) with symptomatic bilateral end-stage medial knee OA participated in this study. They performed relaxed standing, placing one foot on a force plate and thereafter, level walking. First, knee resultant force was calculated on bilateral knees during standing. The knees in each patient were divided into Higher and Lower force side for the definition of dominant side limb. Second, gait parameters in each subject were compared between both sides.Each patient had large weight-bearing asymmetry, though passive range of motion, subjective pain level, femorotibial angle and radiographic disease severities were not significantly different between both sides. In standing, knees on Higher force side were significantly extended (11.2 ± 6.5°) than on Lower force side (14.4 ± 7.3°, P = 0.0086). Similarly, knees on Higher force side were also significantly extended at heel strike during gait. Besides, peak values of extension moment, knee adduction moment, knee adduction moment impulse and vertical force during gait were significantly greater on Higher force side.Ability to extend the knee in standing was considered to be an essential factor to decide loading condition. It is clinically important to examine the ability to extend the knee in standing when considering loading asymmetry during gait in patients with bilateral knee OA.III.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23397422","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Gait analysis","weight":0.86965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_analysis"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.823856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.769557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.550955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.541137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.519435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.422874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Adduction","weight":0.346332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduction"},{"name":"Knee osteoarthritis","weight":0.23318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Force platform","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_platform"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.114781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Heel","weight":0.0176724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Strike action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Net force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_force"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Resultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resultant"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Heel strike (gait)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_strike_(gait)"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"}]}
