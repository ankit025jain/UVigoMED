{"id":16601,"title":"Prostatic and testicular parameters in lepromatous patients.","abstract":"To evaluate PSA (Prostate-specific antigen) parameters in patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL).In a retrospective study, 23 male patients with LL were evaluated. PSA parameters (serum total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), free-to-total PSA ratio (f/tPSA), PSA Density (PSAD)) were assessed. PSA parameters were compared with a control group.The mean tPSA, fPSA, f/tPSA, prostate volume, and PSAD values of the patient group with LL were 1.87 +/- 0.81 ng/ml, 0.67 +/- 0.29 ng/ml, 0.36 +/- 0.11, 41.08 +/- 23.65 ml and 0.055 +/- 0.037, respectively. The mean tPSA, fPSA, f/tPSA, prostate volume, and PSAD values of the control group were 2.71 +/- 0.91 ng/ml, 0.80 +/- 0.34 ng/ml, 0.30 +/- 0.08, 65.0 +/- 28.73 ml and 0.049 +/- 0.028, respectively. The mean tPSA and prostate volume values were found to be significantly lower in the patient group with LL (p = 0.002 and 0.004, respectively). No significant difference was found between two groups in terms of mean fPSA and PSAD values (p = 0.18 and 0.5, respectively). The mean f/tPSA value was found to be significantly higher in the patient group with LL (p = 0.02). Testes in 16 (69%) patients with LL were bilaterally atrophic.Serum tPSA values and prostate volumes in the patients with LL were significantly reduced and f/tPSA values were significantly increased. Testicular atrophy in the lepromatous cases might be due to leprosy-related orchitis and associated with a reduction in prostatic volume.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974442","annotations":[{"name":"Testicular atrophy","weight":0.880674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicular_atrophy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.829799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.732949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Testicle","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.634441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.616491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Orchitis","weight":0.516509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchitis"},{"name":"Leprosy","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.227383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.165412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Lepromatous leprosy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepromatous_leprosy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
