{"id":18863,"title":"Quantification of dermatophyte viability for evaluation of antifungal effect by quantitative PCR.","abstract":"Dermatophytosis is a common disease caused by dermatophyte fungi such as Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. A method of quantifying fungal viability in the lesions of dermatophytosis is indispensable for understanding the therapeutic process and outcome; however, no such method has yet been developed. The aim of this study was to develop a method for quantifying dermatophyte viability by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and D1/D2 regions, including each of rRNA and rDNA, were chosen as the targets, and dermatophyte-specific primer pairs were designed corresponding to ITS and D1/D2 regions. The amounts of target RNA and DNA after heat or antifungal treatment were measured by qPCR and compared with colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. RNA and DNA could extract from dermatophytes by mechanical pulverization of conidia using a Multi-Beads Shocker cell disruptor. Our method was sufficiently sensitive to detect 10 copies by qPCR using both ITS and D1/D2 primer pairs. The most sensitive target was ITS-cDNA after heat or antifungal treatment, and essentially consistent with CFU counts. On the other hands, ITS-DNA and D1/D2-DNA were not decreased soon after heat or antifungal treatment, but those were decreased significantly and reflected the CFU counts after 48Â h of antifungal treatment. We conclude that ITS-cDNA is useful mainly for quantifying dermatophyte viability at early responses, but ITS-DNA and D1/D2-DNA are also available for evaluation, which does not need an early response.
