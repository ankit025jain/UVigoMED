{"id":82051,"title":"Oral health promotion in early childhood: age of joining preventive program and behavioral aspects.","abstract":"To analyze the interference of age in the entrance into a public dental care program for infants as well as family behavioral aspects about tooth decay experience in children 0 to 4 years old.Cross-sectional study involving 465 children who were divided into 3 groups: infants whose mothers joined the program during pregnancy (n=50); infants enrolled in the program during the first year of life (n=230); and infants enrolled in the program between 13 and 18 months old (n=185). The ?(2) and Kruskal-Walis tests (95% confidence interval) were used to assess the relationship among variables.There was an association between the age of entrance in the programs and dental caries (p<0.001). A lower prevalence was seen in infants whose mothers joined the program during pregnancy, and among those infants enrolled in the program during the first year of life. The same low prevalence occurred in relation to mothers' commitment to attend follow-up visits with their infants, cariogenic diet, nighttime oral care, duration of night feeding and parents' educational level (p<0.001). Unfavorable socioeconomic conditions (p>0.05) and daily oral care (p=0.214) were common variables in the groups with 99% of occurrence. Commitment to attend follow-up visits, nighttime oral care and parents' educational level (p>0.05) were considered protective factors for dental caries. Cariogenic diet and night feeding were determinant factors to the appearance of dental caries.To promote children oral health it is essential to enroll children in oral health programs and adopt healthy habits as early as possible, besides the adherence of the child to their parents' advice.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728238","annotations":[{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.826984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.698919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.694254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.687247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.563355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.544551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.484601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.377373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Health promotion","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_promotion"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Determinant","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Habit (psychology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit_(psychology)"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"214","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/214"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Early childhood","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Oral medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_medicine"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
