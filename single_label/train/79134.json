{"id":79134,"title":"Tracheal diverticulum: a rare cause of hoarseness of the voice.","abstract":"Tracheal diverticulum is a rare benign disease also known as paratracheal air cyst. Mostly these are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on radiologic examination of the chest. Common symptoms are cough, recurrent respiratory tract infections, and sometimes dysphagia. Herein we report a rare case of hoarseness of voice caused by tracheal diverticulum. Computed tomography scan of neck revealed a large tracheal diverticulum, probably compressing the recurrent laryngeal nerve as bronchoscopy showed impaired right vocal cord movement. Two weeks after diverticulectomy, the patient's voice returned to normal.
