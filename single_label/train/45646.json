{"id":45646,"title":"[Clinical efficacy observation of heat-sensitive moxibustion with different doses for irritable bowel syndrome].","abstract":"To compare differences of clinical therapeutic effect of heat-sensitive moxibustion with different doses for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).Sixty cases of IBS were randomly divided into a saturated-dose group (30 cases) and a traditional-dose group (30 cases). Heat-sensitive moxibustion was applied in both groups. The acupoints that had the strongest heat-sensitive feeling were selected and treated by warm and suspended moxibustion with moxa stick. Disappearance of heat-sensitive feeling was taken as the sign of treatment time in the saturated-dose group, while the traditional-dose group was treated for 15 min each time. The treatment in both groups was given twice a day for first 5 days, and from the sixth day it was given once a day for continuous 25 times, totally 30 days. Clinical symptom scores and therapeutic effect before and after treatment in two groups were observed.After the treatment, the cured and markedly effective rate was 75.0% (21/28) in the saturated-dose group, which was inferior to 44.4% (12/27) in the traditional-dose group (P < 0.05). The clinical symptom scores, including diarrhea, abdominal distension and pain, were obviously reduced in two groups compared with those before the treatment (all P < 0.05). Compared with the traditional-dose group, the symptom scores of diarrhea and abdominal distension in the saturated-dose group were obviously decreased (0.87 +/- 0.13 vs 1.27 +/- 0.21, P < 0.01; 1.12 +/- 0.41 vs 1.32 +/- 0.26, P < 0.05).The moxibustion featured with disappearance of heat-sensitive feeling and saturated dose has better therapeutic effect than that with traditional-dose for treatment of IBS. As individual dynamic amount of moxibustion, disappearance of heat-sensitive and quantitation varies from person to person, which is one of the key factors to obtain the best curative effect.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673056","annotations":[{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.75335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.54493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.363889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.289465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.277966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"1227","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1227"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Gastric distension","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_distension"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Detection limit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_limit"},{"name":"2120s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2120s"},{"name":"Psychodynamics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics"},{"name":"Disappearance (film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_(film)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"}]}
