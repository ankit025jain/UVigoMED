{"id":57559,"title":"Reference values for placental growth factor (PlGF) concentration and uterine artery doppler pulsatility index (PI) at 11-13(+6) weeks of gestation in the Polish population.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to determine placental growth factor (PIGF) concentration and uterine artery (UtA) Doppler pulsatility index (PI) at 11-13(+6) weeks of gestation in the Polish population.A prospective study was performed in pregnant women who underwent routine ultrasound scan at 11-13(+6) weeks of gestation. All participants completed a questionnaire about their medical history demographics and current pregnancy. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated. Gestational age was confirmed by CRL and mean UtA PI was calculated. Blood samples were taken to measure beta HCG, PAPP-A and P/GF concentrations.Out of the 577 analyzed participants, 60 (10.4%) were found to have abnormal placentation disorders (20 -hypertensive disorders and 40-IUGR). The patients were subdivided into two groups, depending on pregnancy outcome: unaffected (n = 517) and affected (n = 60). The study did not confirm the anticipated correlation between maternal BMI and PIGF, but the concentration of PIGF was significantly increased in smokers. UtA PI values were not statistically significantly different depending on maternal age, BMI, method of conception, smoking or parity The study confirms that both, UtA PI and PIGF concentrations are CRL-dependent. Median MoM values for PIGF and UtA PI were obtained for each set of CRL measurements. Median PIGF MoM was decreased in pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disorders and IUGR as compared to the unaffected group.The established reference ranges for UtA PI and PIGF at 11-13(+6) weeks of gestation may be of clinical value in predicting placenta-associated diseases in early stages of pregnancy in the Polish population.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases
