{"id":68422,"title":"Impact of renal function in patients with multi-vessel coronary disease on long-term mortality following coronary artery bypass grafting compared with percutaneous coronary intervention.","abstract":"Comorbidities, such as diabetes, affect revascularization strategy for coronary disease. We sought to determine if the degree of renal impairment affected long-term mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with multi-vessel coronary disease (MVD).8970 patients with MVD undergoing revascularization between 2004 and 2008, in two multi-center parallel PCI and CABG Australian registries were assigned to three groups based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)?60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=1678:839), 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=452:226) and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=74:37). We used 2:1 propensity matching to compare 3306 patients undergoing primary CABG versus PCI. Shock, myocardial infarction (MI)<24 h, previous CABG, valve surgery or PCI were exclusions. Long-term mortality (mean 3.1 years) was compared with Cox-proportional hazard-adjusted modeling. Observed long-term mortality rates (CABG vs. PCI) were 4.5% vs. 4.3% p=0.84, 12.8% vs. 17.3% p=0.12, and 23.0% vs. 40.5% p=0.05 in the three strata, respectively. In patients with eGFR?60 mL/min/1.73 m2, long-term mortality between PCI and CABG (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65-1.49, p=0.95) was similar. However, amongst patients with eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2, there was a significant mortality hazard with PCI (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.32-3.04, p=0.001). In patients with eGFR<30 mL/min/1.73 m2, there was a trend for hazard with PCI (HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.80-3.46, p=0.17).Long-term mortality in MVD patients with preserved renal function was very low and similar between PCI and CABG. However there was a long-term mortality hazard associated with PCI amongst patients with moderate renal impairment.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521692","annotations":[{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.938866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.881767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Percutaneous coronary intervention","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_coronary_intervention"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.832981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.799312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Coronary disease","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.712922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.673249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.425681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0361946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Human leukocyte antigen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"United States House of Representatives","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
