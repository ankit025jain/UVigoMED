{"id":14612,"title":"[Cystic echinococcosis in the Mersin province (119 cases)].","abstract":"This study was made to emphasize the importance of cystic echinococcosis in the Mersin province and to contribute to informarion regarding the geographic distribution of infection in Turkey.Seven different pathology laboratory records in the Mersin province between the period 2011-2012 were evaluated according to age, sex and organ involvement.In study period, a total of 119 cases of cystic echinococcosis were determined. Male patients constituted 52.94% of the cases, and female, 47.05%. The age distribution of these cases was between 5 and 76 years. Most of the cases appeared in 41-50 (22.68%) year old patients. The most common localizations for cystic echinococcosis was determined in the liver (n: 53, 44.53%) and lung (n: 39, 32.77%), followed by the kidney (n: 4, 3.36%), spleen (n: 3, 2.52%) and gall bladder (n: 3, 2.52%). In 3 cases (2.52%), multiorgan involvement was seen.Cystic echinococcosis is an important health problem in Turkey. The stray dogs, which play an important role in the contagiousness of the disease, should be kept under control and treated. Also, slaughtering of animals must be preformed under the supervision of veterinary surgeons and destruction of infected organs should be carried out under proper conditions in slaughterhouses.","date":"2014-01-13","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412865","annotations":[{"name":"Gallbladder","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.638131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Veterinarian","weight":0.532454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.52031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.487328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Echinococcosis","weight":0.385456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.356322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.305285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Bile","weight":0.20368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile"},{"name":"Geography","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography"},{"name":"Slaughterhouse","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Animal slaughter","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_slaughter"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Feral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
