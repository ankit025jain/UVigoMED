{"id":42615,"title":"Gastric cancer cell adhesion to laminin enhances acquired chemotherapeutic drug resistance mediated by MGr1-Ag/37LRP.","abstract":"Adhesion of cancer cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) causes a novel acquired chemotherapeutic drug?resistant phenotype, referred to as cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Our previous studies suggested that the adhesion molecule MGr1-Ag/37LRP may promote multidrug resistance in gastric cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated MGr1-Ag/37LRP binding-induced adhesion, and its role in CAM-DR. Initial studies revealed that, after adhesion to the ECM, the multidrug-resistant gastric cancer cell lines SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901/ADR showed significantly higher mean adhesive cell numbers than non?resistant SGC7901 cells. We then investigated expression of MGr1-Ag/37LRP in gastric cancer cells adhering to laminin. Western blotting, RT-PCR and dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that laminin induced MGr1-Ag/37LRP expression and activity. In vitro and in vivo assays revealed that small interfering RNA against MGr1-Ag/37LRP significantly reduced CAM-DR in SGC7901/VCR cells. In vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that binding of MGr1-Ag/37LRP decreased intracellular drug accumulation by increasing P-glycoprotein and multidrug-associated protein expression, and inhibited drug-induced apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2 and Bax expression. These results indicate that MGr1-Ag/37LRP contributes to laminin-mediated CAM-DR in gastric cancer cells, and is a potentially effective target for reversing this phenomenon in gastric cancer.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24840404","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.89669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Laminin","weight":0.829674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminin"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.803296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.795511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.749083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.730912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.72565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.666424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.655978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.627861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.589214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.560235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.508618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.508055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.45683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.16028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Blot (biology)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blot_(biology)"},{"name":"Bcl-2-associated X protein","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2-associated_X_protein"},{"name":"Bioaccumulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaccumulation"},{"name":"Matrix (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(biology)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}]}
