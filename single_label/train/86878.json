{"id":86878,"title":"[Structure and function of 3'- untranslated region in picornavirus].","abstract":"Both sides of the picornavirus genome have 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) and 3'- untranslated region (3'UTR). This study demontrated that both the 5'-and 3'-UTR can form complex structures, such as stem-loop, clover and pseudoknot structure, These structures play an important role in the regulaton of the replication and translation of the viruses. This article reviewed the progress of research on the structure and function of picornavirus' 3'-UTR over recent years.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272604","annotations":[{"name":"Genome","weight":0.807009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Pseudoknot","weight":0.74413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoknot"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.685161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.619257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Picornavirus","weight":0.0989124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picornavirus"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Clover","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clover"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
