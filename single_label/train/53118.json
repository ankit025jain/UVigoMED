{"id":53118,"title":"Myocardial protection by remote ischaemic pre-conditioning is abolished in sulphonylurea-treated diabetics undergoing coronary revascularisation.","abstract":"Remote ischaemic pre-conditioning attenuates myocardial injury. Because sulphonylurea drugs interfere with ischaemic and anaesthetic pre-conditioning, we assessed whether remote ischaemic pre-conditioning effects are altered in sulphonylurea-treated diabetics.Remote ischaemic pre-conditioning in non-diabetic patients evoked a 41% decrease in the troponin I concentration area under curve (514 ng/ml × 72 h ± 600 vs. 302 ± 190, P = 0.001) but no change (404 ng/ml × 72 h ± 224 vs. 471 ± 383, P = 0.62) in sulphonylurea-treated diabetics. There was no significant correlation between the troponin I concentration area under curve and arterial glucose concentrations, and the latter was not an independent confounder.Cardioprotection by remote ischaemic pre-conditioning during isoflurane anaesthesia is abolished in sulphonylurea-treated diabetics.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548338","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.770938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.674841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.645747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.629021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.627284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Troponin","weight":0.509643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.499321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.464852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Isoflurane","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflurane"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Confounding","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding"},{"name":"Sulfonylurea","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonylurea"},{"name":"Revascularization","weight":0.0503109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revascularization"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Troponin I","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin_I"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/224"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Preconditioner","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preconditioner"}]}
