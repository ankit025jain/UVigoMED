{"id":76911,"title":"Associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with quality of life and self-rated health in an older population.","abstract":"Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with impaired physical functioning, depression, and several chronic diseases and might thereby affect quality of life and self-rated health.The aim of this study was to assess relationships of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] with quality of life and self-rated health and to examine whether physical performance, depressive symptoms, and number of chronic diseases mediate these relationships.We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, an ongoing population-based cohort study of older Dutch individuals.Serum 25(OH)D was classified into the following categories: less than 25, 25-50, and 50 nmol/L or greater. We assessed quality of life (QOL) using the Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12; n = 862) and self-rated health (SRH) with a single question, dichotomized into good vs poor SRH (n = 1248).Individuals with serum 25(OH)D less than 25 nmol/L scored lower on the physical component score of the SF-12 and had a lower odds on good SRH score compared with individuals with serum 25(OH)D greater than 50 nmol/L (? (95% confidence interval) -3.9 (-6.5 to -1.3) for SF-12, and odds ratio [95% confidence interval) 0.50 (0.33-0.76) for SRH]. Physical performance, depressive symptoms, and the number of chronic diseases were associated with vitamin D status, QOL, and SRH. Adding all these potential mediators to regression models attenuated associations of 25(OH)D less than 25 nmol/L with QOL with 78% and SRH with 32%.Lower 25(OH)D status is related to lower scores on QOL and SRH. A large part of the association with QOL can statistically be explained by physical performance, depressive symptoms, and the number of chronic diseases.","date":"2014-09-06","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885628","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.762877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Vitamin D","weight":0.711662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.653015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.632136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.619035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.548177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.515908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.360127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.154348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.134085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Amsterdam","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam"},{"name":"Dichotomy","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Mediation (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_(statistics)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
