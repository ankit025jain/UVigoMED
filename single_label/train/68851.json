{"id":68851,"title":"[Relationship between dendritic cell and microvessel density in clear cell renal cell carcinoma].","abstract":"To investigate the relationship between the number and maturation of dendritic cell (DC) and microvessel density (MVD) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC).CCRCC paraffin-embedded tissues and surrounding normal tissues were collected from 30 cases of CCRCC who underwent operations in No. 307 hospital of PLA during July, 2010 to January, 2013. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expressions of CD11c, MHC-II, and CD34 to analyze the relationship among them.The positive expression rate of CD11c in CCRCC tissues [(93.08±66.14)%] was higher than that in the surrounding tissues [(25.91±12.29)%]. MVD in CCRCC tissues (26.31±11.05) was significantly higher than that in the surrounding tissues (12.78±5.49). The permillage of MHC-II positive DC in CCRCC tissues [(9.65±3.61)%] was significantly lower than that in the surrounding tissues [(17.60±6.26)%]. There was a negative correlation between the MVD value and the expression of MHC-II; there was no correlation between the MVD and the expression of CD11c. Positive expressions of various indicators in CCRCC tissues were not related to patients' age, sex, and TNM classification.In CCRCC tissues, there were higher MVD and more DCs than in the surrounding tissues, yet there were less mature DCs. There was a negative correlation between the MVD and the maturation of DC.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491063","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.861098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.836937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.825137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.613073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.321426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.231211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_(Russia)"},{"name":"Per mil","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_mil"},{"name":"CD34","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"CD11c","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD11c"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"785","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/785"},{"name":"653","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/653"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Direct current","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current"},{"name":"Facial expression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"},{"name":"Negative relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_relationship"},{"name":"People's Liberation Army","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
