{"id":67295,"title":"Renal artery embolization in a gross kidney neoplasm. Case report.","abstract":"To demonstrate the utility of the renal artery embolization (RAE) in the dissection of gross neoplasms and the reduction in blood loss and operative time.We report a case of a gross left renal neoplasm (with the diameter of about 12 cm) in a 45 years old Caucasian female who underwent to renal artery embolization 24 hours before left nephroureterectomy. This procedure has determined a reduction in operative times (about 90 minutes) because of the ligature of the renal vein was facilitated. Intraoperative blood loss was of about 100 ml and the patient didn't need of blood transfusions; the abdominal drain was removed in third postoperative day (daily drained serous fluid was about 20 ml). The patient was discharged 7 days later.RAE facilitates the dissection of gross neoplasms (diameter> than 10 cm), so causing a reduction in intraoperative blood loss and in blood transfusion. The operative times are lower because the ligature of the renal vein is less difficult and the dissection is facilitated for the presence of tissue oedema. The disadvantages are the incomplete hembolyzation, coil migration, hematomes, post-infarction syndrome (nausea, vomit, abdominal pain, leucocytosis, hyperpyrexia, hematoma); other risks include the possibility of pulmonary embolism, intestinal infarction and infections. Its reduced utilization could be due to the lack of randomized prospective studies showing its potential benefits.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629812","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary embolism","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism"},{"name":"Renal vein","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_vein"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.858933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.81338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.781345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.772104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Embolism","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolism"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.677836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Leukocytosis","weight":0.484724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.467669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.336368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.286167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.249403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.239044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.112973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Bowel infarction","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_infarction"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Gross examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_examination"}]}
