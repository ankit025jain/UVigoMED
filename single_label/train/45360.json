{"id":45360,"title":"A recurrence of benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma treated through laparoscopic excision: a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare cystic tumor with approximately 140 cases reported to date. It is found mainly in women of reproductive age and is commonly attached to the serosal surface of pelvic viscera. The pathogenesis is uncertain and debate regarding its neoplastic or reactive nature exists. The presenting symptoms are often nonspecific and most commonly include vague lower abdominal pain and fullness. Imaging studies are used to identify the lesion, but histologic studies with the aid of immunohistochemical techniques are needed for definitive diagnosis as the differential diagnosis is quite extensive. Surgical resection is the primary form of treatment, and follow-up is important due to the high rate of recurrence and the rare possibility of malignant transformation. Here, we present a case of a 50-year-old female with a recurrence of benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma treated through laparoscopic excision and also a review of the literature.
