{"id":67296,"title":"Prevalence and risk of cancer of incidental uptake in prostate identified by fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography.","abstract":"The objective was to investigate the prevalence of incidental fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography/computed tomography.A total of 11,239 male nonprostate disease patients were included retrospectively.The prevalence of incidental prostate FDG uptake was approximately 1.8%. Among 198 incidental lesions, 100 patients had further examinations; 20 lesions were confirmed to be malignant, while 80 lesions were benign. After logistic regression analysis, age, site, and the maximum standard uptake value were the potent predictors for differentiation of malignant prostate lesions.When focal FDG uptake in the peripheral zone of prostate is detected, especially in elderly men, further clinical evaluation is recommended.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629790","annotations":[{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.611063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.598602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.440918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.408333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.361358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.295474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.273195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.194179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.145517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.113056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Positron","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Fluorine","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"239","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/239"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Positron emission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Air pollution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"}]}
