{"id":88961,"title":"Unusual presentation of a type 1 Monteggia equivalent lesion: simultaneous medial humeral condyle fracture with ipsilateral anterior dislocation of the radial head and acute plastic bowing of the ulna.","abstract":"The authors describe a case of simultaneous anterior dislocation of the radial head with plastic deformation of the ulna and an ipsilateral medial humeral condyle fracture in a 6-year-old boy after a fall on an outstretched hand. This rare combination of injuries has not been described previously in the literature. Closed reduction of the dislocated radial head and percutaneous K-wire fixation of the medial humeral condyle fracture achieved an excellent result with full function. This rare combination of injuries is considered to be an unusual subtype of the Bado type I Monteggia equivalent lesion. The case emphasizes that when a fracture is detected around an elbow, other injuries in the region should be suspected.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769777","annotations":[{"name":"Ulna","weight":0.888095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.802046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Plasticity (physics)","weight":0.730444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.691531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.674364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"Head of radius","weight":0.414334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_radius"},{"name":"Monteggia fracture","weight":0.347232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteggia_fracture"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.326876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.0703369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Reduction (orthopedic surgery)","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(orthopedic_surgery)"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Subtype polymorphism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtype_polymorphism"},{"name":"Osteogenesis imperfecta","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Undescribed taxon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undescribed_taxon"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
