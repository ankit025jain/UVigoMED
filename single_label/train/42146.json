{"id":42146,"title":"Recycling of jejunal effluent to enable enteral nutrition in short bowel syndrome.","abstract":"A 41-year-old woman developed severe abdominal pain, distension and faeculent vomiting. CT of abdomen and pelvis revealed small bowel malrotation with a right paraduodenal hernia. At emergency laparotomy, a right paraduodenal hernia containing jejunum and ileum was identified. She had a viable duodenum with 50?cm of ischaemic proximal jejunum which was exteriorised as an end jejunostomy; 180?cm of infarcted jejunum and ileum was resected. The proximal end of 150?cm of healthy ileum was exteriorised as a closed mucous fistula and 50?cm distally a feeding ileostomy was constructed. On day 5 postoperatively, jejunal effluent began to be recycled via her feeding ileostomy and she never required parenteral nutrition. Despite having only 50?cm of jejunum proximal to her stoma, recycling of effluent enabled her electrolytes to remain normal. She put on weight postoperatively and proceeded to closure of her stomas at 6?months, not requiring laparotomy.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872491","annotations":[{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Duodenum","weight":0.903192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.881237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Ileum","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileum"},{"name":"Short bowel syndrome","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_bowel_syndrome"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Stoma","weight":0.821218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.813725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Electrolyte","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Nasogastric intubation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.68384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Ileostomy","weight":0.631609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileostomy"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Intestinal malrotation","weight":0.577993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_malrotation"},{"name":"Parenteral nutrition","weight":0.537356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.522162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Medical emergency","weight":0.429215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.28405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Abdominal distension","weight":0.211135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_distension"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0370354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Jejunostomy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunostomy"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"}]}
