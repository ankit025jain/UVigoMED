{"id":37113,"title":"Surgical treatment of hand vascular anomalies--a case report.","abstract":"Vascular anomalies in the hand do not occur frequently. Their presence in the metacarpal region can cause different functional disorders. The extent of such disorders directly depends on the localization and size of vascular anomalies, duration and the nature of the anomaly growth as well as on eventual secondary complications such as ulceration or bleeding. The aim of this case report was to show the specifics in the clinical picture, pathogenesis and evolution of such anomalies, applied diagnostic procedures (radiography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance, electromyography) and surgical treatment as well as postoperative functional results.In the Clinic for Plastic Surgery and Burns, Military Medical Academy Belgrade, two patients were treated surgically for vascular anomalies of the middle palmar region of the hand. The first patient, a 36-year-old male, a former active sportsman (professional handball player) was treated for acute increase in the vascular anomaly of hand in the metacarpal region and proximal phalange of III and IV fingers of his right hand. The anomaly was detected 6 months prior to his hospitalization while two weeks before the hospitalization there was a sudden growth and increase in the change. The second case, a 15-year-old male patient actively pursuing a career in professional basketball was treated for a tumor localized in the metacarpal zone of his left hand. According to the information provided by his parents, the anomaly had been present since his birth. Initially, the anomaly manifested itself as a discoloration of the skin with a marked capillary drawing, gradually increasing throughout the last five years to the present dimension. The growth of the malformation was noticed to coincide in both patients with more active pursuit of their professional sports career.The clinical picture of hand vascular anomalies is dominated by the symptoms of compression of neurovascular structures (paresthesia, intense hand pain, swollen fingers). If it is a chronic progressive process, signs of ischemic intrinsic muscle fibrosis with corresponding functional deficit, as well as tissue defect (usura) of bone and joint structures represent the basic pathological findings. Acute increase is accompanied by compartment syndrome symptoms and ischemic fibrosis of intrinsic hand musculature and development of irreversible dysfunction of the hand. In the presented cases rapid response implies accurate diagnostic methods followed by surgical extirpation in order to treat compartment syndrome.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Congenital
