{"id":88473,"title":"Effects of perioperatively administered dexamethasone on surgical wound healing in patients undergoing surgery for zygomatic fracture: a prospective study.","abstract":"The aims of the study were to clarify the occurrence of disturbance in surgical wound healing (DSWH) after surgery of zygomatic complex (ZC) fractures and to determine whether perioperatively applied dexamethasone increases the risk for DSWH.Of 64 patients who were included in a single-blind prospective trial, 33 perioperatively received a total dose of 10 mg or 30 mg of dexamethasone. The remaining 31 patients served as controls.DSWH occurred in 9 patients (14.1%). Occurrence of DSWH was 24.4% in patients who received dexamethasone and 3.2% in controls. The association between DSWH and dexamethasone was significant (P = .016). Intraoral approach also was associated with DSWH significantly (P = .042). No association emerged between DSWH and age, gender, time span from accident to surgery, or duration of surgery.DSWH occurred significantly more frequently in patients who received perioperative dexamethasone. Because of increased risk of DSWH, perioperative dexamethasone cannot be recommended in open reduction and fixation of ZC fractures.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842445","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.587655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.391724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.172483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.165507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Accident","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident"},{"name":"Dexamethasone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Span (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_(architecture)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Riot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Radiation hardening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_hardening"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"}]}
