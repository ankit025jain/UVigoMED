{"id":91475,"title":"[Effectiveness of long segment fixation combined with vertebroplasty for severe osteoporotic thoracolumbar compressive fractures].","abstract":"To study the effectiveness of long segment fixation combined with vertebroplasty (LSF-VP) for severe osteoporotic thoracolumbar compressive fractures with kyphosis deformity.Between March 2006 and May 2012, a retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 48 cases of severe osteoporotic thoracolumbar compressive fractures with more than 50% collapse of the anterior vertebral body or more than 400 of sagittal angulation, which were treated by LSF-VP in 27 cases (LSF-VP group) or percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in 21 cases (PKP group). All patients suffered from single thoracolumbar vertebral compressive fracture at T11 to L2. There was no significant difference in gender, age, spinal segment, and T values of bone mineral density between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The effectiveness of the treatment was appraised by visual analogue scale (VAS), Cobb angle of thoracolumbar kyphosis, height of anterior/posterior vertebral body, and compressive ratio of vertebrae before and after operations.The LSF-VP group had longer operation time, hospitalization days, and more bone cement injection volume than the PKP group, showing significant differences (P < 0.05). Intraoperative blood loss in LSF-VP group ranged from 220 to 1,050 mL (mean, 517 mL). No pulmonaryor cerebral embolism or cerebrospinal fluid leakage was found in both groups. Asymptomatic bone cement leakage was found in 3 cases of LSF-VP group and 2 cases of PKP group. The patients were followed up for 16-78 months (mean, 41.1 months) in LSF-VP group, and 12-71 months (mean, 42.1 months) in PKP group. No fixation failure such as loosened or broken pedicle screw was found in LSF-VP group during the follow-up, and no re-fracture or adjacent vertebral body fracture was found. Two cases in PKP group at 39 and 56 months after operation respectively were found to have poor maintenance of vertebral height and loss of rectification (Cobb angle was more than 40 degrees) with recurrence of pain, which were treated by second surgery of LSF-VP; another case had compressive fracture of the adjacent segment and thoracolumbar kyphosis at 16 months after operation, which was treated by second surgery of LSF-VP. There were significant differences in the other indexes between each pair of the three time points (P < 0.05), except the Cobb angle of thoracolumbar kyphosis, and the height of posterior vertebral body between discharge and last follow-up in LSF-VP group, and except the Cobb angle of thoracolumbar kyphosis and compressive ratio of bertebrae between discharge and last follow-up in PKP group (P > 0.05). After operation, the other indexes of LSF-VP group were significantly better than those of PKP group at each time point (P < 0.05), except the VAS score and the height of posterior vertebral body at discharge (P > 0.05).The effectiveness of LSF-VP is satisfactory in treating severe osteoporotic thoracolumbar compressive fractures with kyphosis deformity. LSF-VP can acquire better rectification of kyphosis and recovery of vertebral body height than PKP.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Wounds and
