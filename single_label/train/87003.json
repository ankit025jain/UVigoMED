{"id":87003,"title":"A PCR-based microwell-plate hybrid capture assay for high-risk human papillomavirus.","abstract":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with cervical cancer. In this study, we developed a high-throughput microwell-plate hybrid capture (MPHC) method for epidemiological studies of high-risk HPV (HRHPV). The results with 1238 cervical specimens from female outpatients showed a concordance rate of 94.3 % between the MPHC and Hybrid Capture II assay. The MPHC assay showed an average HRHPV rate of 29.3 % for high-risk populations in populous cities of China. The established MPHC assay could sensitively and specifically detect 13 types of HRHPV and is suitable for large-scale screening, especially in areas where real-time PCR or fluorescence equipment is unavailable.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091742","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.810982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"China","weight":0.760937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.725218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.673041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.50138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.426477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.391104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.365308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"1238","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1238"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"List of cities in China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_China"}]}
