{"id":37014,"title":"Laparoscopic approach for rectosigmoidian resection in children.","abstract":"Abdominoperineal approach for rectosigmoidian resection,first imagined and performed in 1948 by Orwar Swenson,was the surgical technique that opened the pathway in the treatment of congenital megacolon (1). B. Duhamel (1956) and F. Soave (1964) intended to correct the postoperative complications appeared after the Duhamel technique and proposed surgical procedures that keep the aganglionic rectum in transit (2,3). In 1994 K. Bax reproduces the Duhamel procedure using laparoscopic approach (4). K.Georgeson, in 1995, reproduced the Swenson technique for rectosigmoidian resection using minimal invasive surgery (5).Today, this approach represents the most frequently used procedure for the radical treatment of congenital megacolon.","date":"2014-02-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524481","annotations":[{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.780784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.741901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.614257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.611136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.565257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.526233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Megacolon","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacolon"},{"name":"Soave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soave"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"1964","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964"},{"name":"1948","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948"},{"name":"1995","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995"},{"name":"1956 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Today (NBC program)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(NBC_program)"},{"name":"Keep","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep"},{"name":"Duhamel, Alberta","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhamel,_Alberta"},{"name":"1994","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994"},{"name":"Public transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Reproduction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Swenson, Texas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swenson,_Texas"}]}
