{"id":16581,"title":"The effects of LPS-induced endotoxemia on the expression of adiponectin and its receptors in female rats.","abstract":"Adiponectin (APN), secreted by white adipose tissue (WAT), acts as a protective factor against inflammatory conditions. However, the changes in the expression levels of endogenous APN and the two types of APN receptor (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) induced by acute inflammatory conditions have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the changes in peripheral and/or central APN and AdipoR expression caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis were examined in gonadal-intact (Sham) and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. As it has been reported that APN and AdipoR suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines to prevent excessive inflammation, the mRNAs of these molecules were also examined. LPS injection induced increases in visceral WAT APN mRNA without affecting the serum APN level in both the Sham and OVX rats. OVX rats exhibited higher serum APN levels than Sham rats. LPS injection increased the subcutaneous WAT APN mRNA in OVX rats. In both Sham and OVX rats, LPS injection led to a decrease in hepatic AdipoR2 mRNA and an increase in hypothalamic AdipoR2 mRNA. Hypothalamic AdipoR2 mRNA was upregulated 24 h after LPS injection in OVX but not Sham rats. Serum TNF-? level at 6 h after LPS injection and hypothalamic and hepatic IL-6 and TNF-? mRNA at 24 h after LPS injection were significantly higher in Sham than OVX rats. These results suggest that APN and AdipoR play roles in modulating inflammation under septic conditions in female rats.
