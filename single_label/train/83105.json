{"id":83105,"title":"Relation between the expression of mitotic centromere-associated kinesin and the progression of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.","abstract":"Mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) is a microtubule depolymerase indispensable for microtubule binding during spindle formation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of MCAK expression with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT).Immunohistochemistry was used in 47 cases of SCCOT. Determination of proliferation and migratory capabilities was performed with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Transwell chamber assay, respectively, on cells from the human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line Tca8113 that were transfected with MCAK small interfering RNA (siRNA).MCAK expression level in oral tongue cancer tissue is significantly higher (P < .01) than that of corresponding normal tissue. In addition, high expression of MCAK is significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P < .05) and tumor staging (P < .01). Moreover, gene silencing of MCAK suppresses proliferation and migration of Tca8113 cells (P < .05; P < .01).The expression of MCAK may be associated with the progression of SCCOT.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24445227","annotations":[{"name":"Small interfering RNA","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_interfering_RNA"},{"name":"Microtubule","weight":0.911436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.897309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.875885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Spindle apparatus","weight":0.770567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_apparatus"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Oral cancer","weight":0.634837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.522945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.474663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Kinesin","weight":0.457443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesin"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.270331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.154924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Bromide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide"}]}
