{"id":51301,"title":"The secretory deficit in islets from db/db mice is mainly due to a loss of responding beta cells.","abstract":"We used the db/db mouse to determine the nature of the secretory defect in intact islets.Glucose tolerance was compared in db/db and wild-type (WT) mice. Isolated islets were used: to measure insulin secretion and calcium in a two-photon assay of single-insulin-granule fusion; and for immunofluorescence of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins (SNAREs).The 13-18-week-old db/db mice showed a diabetic phenotype. Isolated db/db islets showed a 77% reduction in insulin secretion induced by 15 mmol/l glucose and reductions in the amplitude and rise-time of the calcium response to glucose. Ionomycin-induced insulin secretion in WT but not db/db islets. Immunofluorescence showed an increase in the levels of the SNAREs synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) in db/db islets, but reduced syntaxin-1A. Therefore, db/db islets have both a compromised calcium response to glucose and a compromised secretory response to calcium. Two-photon microscopy of isolated islets determined the number and distribution of insulin granule exocytic events. Compared with WT, db/db islets showed far fewer exocytic events (an 83% decline at 15 mmol/l glucose). This decline was due to a 73% loss of responding cells and, in the remaining responsive cells, a 50% loss of exocytic responses per cell. An assay measuring granule re-acidification showed evidence for more recaptured granules in db/db islets compared with WT.We showed that db/db islets had a reduced calcium response to glucose and a reduction in syntaxin-1A. Within the db/db islets, changes were manifest as both a reduction in responding cells and a reduction in fusing insulin granules per cell.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705605","annotations":[{"name":"Immunofluorescence","weight":0.891656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.729272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.724649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Beta cell","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_cell"},{"name":"Membrane protein","weight":0.629262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_protein"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.599778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.582824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.540761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.445995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.414333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.347706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Islets of Langerhans","weight":0.0449185,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"SNAP25","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAP25"},{"name":"Syntaxin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntaxin"},{"name":"SNARE (protein)","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNARE_(protein)"},{"name":"Granule (cell biology)","weight":0.0200776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granule_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Beta decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Nuclear fusion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"}]}
