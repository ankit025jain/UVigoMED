{"id":53691,"title":"Expression of DNA-repair proteins and their significance in pancreatic cancer and non-cancerous pancreatic tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats.","abstract":"To establish a model of pancreatic cancer induced by 7,12-dimethylbenzantracene (DMBA) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and detect the expression of DNA-repair proteins (MGMT, ERCC?, hMSH?, and hMLH?) and their significance in pancreatic cancer and non-cancerous pancreatic tissues of SD rats.DMBA was directly implanted into the parenchyma of rat pancreas (group A and group B), and group B rats were then treated with trichostatin A (TSA). The rats in both groups were executed within 3 to 5 months, and their pancreatic tissues were observed by macrography and under microscopy. Meanwhile, the rats in the control group (group C) were executed at 5 months. Immunohistochemistry was used to assay the expression of MGMT, ERCC?, hMSH?, and hMLH?.The incidence of pancreatic cancer in group A within 3 to 5 months was 48.7% (18/37), including 1 case of fibrosarcoma. The incidence of pancreatic cancer in group B was 33.3% (12/36), including 1 case of fibrosarcoma. The mean of maximal diameters of tumors in group A was higher than that in group B (P <0.05). No pathological changes were found in pancreas of group C and other main organs (except pancreas) of group A and group B. No statistical differences were found among the positive rates of MGMT, ERCC?, hMSH?, and hMLH? in ductal adenocarcinoma and non-cancerous pancreatic tissues of group A (P >0.05). The positive rates of MGMT, ERCC?, hMSH?, and hMLH? were significantly lower in ductal adenocarcinoma than those in non-cancerous tissues of group B (P ?0.05). All pancreas of group C had positive expression of MGMT, ERCC?, hMSH?, and hMLH? and two cases of fibrosarcoma showed a negative expression.DMBA, directly implanted into the parenchyma of pancreas, creates an ideal pancreatic cancer model within a short time. TSA might restrain DNA damage related to the genesis and growth of pancreatic cancer in rats. The DNA-repair proteins, including MGMT, ERCC?, hMSH?, and hMLH?, might play an important role in the genesis of pancreatic cancer induced by DMBA in rats.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502441","annotations":[{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.863773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.767518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.746322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.712706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Fibrosarcoma","weight":0.699764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosarcoma"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.420984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.334987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mammary ductal carcinoma","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_ductal_carcinoma"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Trichostatin A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichostatin_A"},{"name":"MGMT","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGMT"},{"name":"7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ideal (ring theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"1837","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1837"},{"name":"1236","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1236"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"}]}
