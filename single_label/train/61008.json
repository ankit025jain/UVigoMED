{"id":61008,"title":"The association between inherited thrombophilia and recurrent pregnancy loss in Turkish women.","abstract":"To investigate the relation between recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, and C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutations.A case-control study was conducted on 95 consecutive cases with RPL, and 40 age-matched controls who had no history of pregnancy loss and had at least one successful pregnancy. After application of exclusion criteria, 60 patients in the study group and 40 control cases were compared for thrombophilic factors.Thirteen out of 60 RPL cases and one out of 40 in the control group were carriers of factor V Leiden mutation. While six patients were carriers of prothrombin G20210A gene mutation, none in the control group carried this mutation. Twenty-nine out of 60 RPL cases and 17 out of 40 control cases had MTHFR mutation.The authors found a positive correlation between RPL and FVL and FII gene mutations, but no significant association between RPL and MTHFR gene mutation.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779247","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.754207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.719721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.557954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Leiden","weight":0.27987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden"},{"name":"Habitual abortion","weight":0.234541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitual_abortion"},{"name":"Factor V","weight":0.225141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_V"},{"name":"Factor V Leiden","weight":0.209541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_V_Leiden"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.185869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Thrombin","weight":0.0695851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombin"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Turkey","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Institutional investor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"}]}
