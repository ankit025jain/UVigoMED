{"id":81945,"title":"Stromal transforming growth factor-beta 1 is crucial for reinforcing the invasive potential of low invasive cancer.","abstract":"Tumour cells alter the characteristics of the adjacent stroma to create a supportive microenvironment during cancer progression. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to verify the role of stromal TGF-?1 in reinforcing of the invasive potential in low invasive cancer.Isolated NF or CAF was co-cultured with low invasive HSC-2 cells to evaluate whether stromal TGF-?1 induced PDPN expression by Transwell invasion and influenced tumour growth in orthotopic xenografts.Stimulation by TGF-?1 promoted PDPN expression and Transwell invasion through SMAD signalling as well as activation of Src, P38 mitogen activated protein kinase and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2. PDPN induction was T?RII-dependent. Tumour growth of HSC-2 OSCC in a mouse xenograft was intensified in the tumour CAF microenvironment.Stromal TGF-?1 signalling promoted PDPN expression in cancer cells, thereby enhancing tumour growth and leading to a more invasive phenotype.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769314","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.800257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.779432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Src (gene)","weight":0.736869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Src_(gene)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.711112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.668418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Mitogen","weight":0.532646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen"},{"name":"Protein kinase","weight":0.481475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.455848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.30868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.064482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"SMAD (protein)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMAD_(protein)"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Enzyme induction and inhibition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition"},{"name":"Heart transplantation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_transplantation"},{"name":"Confederation of African Football","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_of_African_Football"},{"name":"Reinforcement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"},{"name":"Walther P38","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_P38"}]}
