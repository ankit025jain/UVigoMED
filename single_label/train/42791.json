{"id":42791,"title":"Prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating FoxP3+ T cells in gastrointestinal cancers: a meta analysis.","abstract":"Tumor-infiltrating FoxP3+ T cells have been reported in various human tumors, which impaired cell-mediated immunity and promoted disease progression. However, its prognostic value for survival in patients with different gastrointestinal cancers [hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (GC)] remains controversial.Relevant literature was searched using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Ovid Medline and Chinese wanfang databases. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate pooled survival and recurrence ratios. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated employing fixed- or random-effects models depending on the heterogeneity of the included trials.For HCC and GC, the overall survival at 1, 3 and 5-year of high FoxP3+ T cells infiltration patients were lower than low FoxP3+ T cells infiltration patients (P<0.05). The recurrences at 1, 3 and 5-year of high FoxP3+ T cells infiltration patients were higher than low FoxP3+ T cells infiltration patients (P<0.001). But for CRC, the overall survival at 1, 3 and 5-year of high FoxP3+ T cells infiltration patients were higher than low FoxP3+ T cells infiltration patients (P<0.001). There were no differences in 1, 3 and 5-year recurrences between high and low FoxP3+ T cells infiltration patients (P>0.05).Our findings suggested that tumor-infiltrating FoxP3+ T cells were a factor for a poor prognosis for HCC and GC, but a good prognosis for CRC.","date":"2014-05-15","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24827118","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.928595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.809173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.772698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.717325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.665631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.592802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.53479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.458165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.369099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"China","weight":0.364223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.286805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.262524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Ovid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Costa Rica","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Gas chromatography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"}]}
