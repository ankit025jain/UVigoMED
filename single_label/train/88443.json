{"id":88443,"title":"I.v. contrast administration with dual source 128-MDCT: a randomized controlled study comparing 18-gauge nonfenestrated and 20-gauge fenestrated catheters for catheter placement success, infusion rate, image quality, and complications.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of a 20-gauge fenestrated catheter with an 18-gauge nonfenestrated catheter for i.v. contrast infusion during MDCT.Two hundred five adult outpatients imaged on a dual-source 128-MDCT scanner with arterial phase body CT (flow rates, 5.0-7.5 mL/s) were randomized to either an 18-gauge nonfenestrated or 20-gauge fenestrated catheter. After randomization, any 18-gauge nonfenestrated subjects whose veins were deemed insufficient for that catheter gauge were assigned to a third cohort for placement of a 20-gauge fenestrated catheter. Catheter placement success, infusion rate, contrast volume, maximum pressure, complications, and aortic enhancement levels were recorded.Catheters were placed on the first attempt in 97% (100/103) for 18-gauge nonfenestrated and 94% (96/102) for 20-gauge fenestrated placements and in two or fewer attempts in 99% of both groups. Mean infusion rates (5.74 mL/s for 18-gauge nonfenestrated and 5.58 mL/s for 20-gauge fenestrated placements) and aortic enhancement levels were not significantly different. Maximum pressure was higher with 20-gauge fenestrated catheters (mean ± SD, 230.5 ± 27.6 pounds per square inch [psi]) than 18-gauge nonfenestrated catheters (mean ± SD 215.6 ± 32.8 psi) (p = 0.002). One subject with an 18-gauge nonfenestrated catheter had a high-pressure alarm. In the third cohort, a 20-gauge fenestrated catheter was successfully placed in two or fewer attempts in 85% (28/33), with one minor extravasation attributed to vein insufficiency.A 20-gauge fenestrated catheter performs similarly to an 18-gauge nonfenestrated catheter with respect to i.v. contrast infusion rates and aortic enhancement levels and can be placed in most subjects whose veins are deemed insufficient for an 18-gauge catheter.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848812","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.651394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.559219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.366305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Pound (mass)","weight":0.235758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"},{"name":"Pounds per square inch","weight":0.203316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pounds_per_square_inch"},{"name":"Inch","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.149266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.0522101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Volumetric flow rate","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Extravasation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravasation"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"230","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230"},{"name":"Alarm devices","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_devices"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Track gauge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Square (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(geometry)"},{"name":"Square inch","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_inch"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Image quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 20","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_20"},{"name":"Window","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window"}]}
