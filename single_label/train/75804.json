{"id":75804,"title":"Delays in time to surgery for minorities with temporal lobe epilepsy.","abstract":"To determine whether adult minority patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) experience significantly longer times to anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) following presurgical evaluation.A retrospective cohort study of 223 adult patients with epilepsy (PWE) and unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis who completed presurgical evaluation in the epilepsy monitoring unit at University of California, San Francisco, between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 2010, with follow-up through December 31, 2012. Log-rank test was performed for Kaplan-Meier survival curves of time to ATL stratified by race/ethnicity and by limited English proficiency (LEP). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards and Weibull modeling.African Americans (AAs) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (Asian/PIs) experienced significantly longer times to surgery than whites in Kaplan-Meier plots (log-rank test p = 0.02 and p = 0.005, respectively). AAs and Asian/PIs also had longer times to surgery after adjusting for frailty, LEP, sex, age, mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) laterality, and nonconcordant ictal electroencephalography (EEG) (adjusted HR = 0.22, p = 0.006; adjusted HR = 0.25, p = 0.003, respectively). Patients with LEP experienced significantly longer times to surgery than patients proficient in English (log-rank test p = 0.0085; adjusted HR = 0.48, p = 0.041). In Cox modeling, nonconcordant ictal EEG studies (adjusted HR = 0.47, p = 0.01), left-sided MTS (adjusted HR = 0.69, p = 0.023), and female sex (adjusted HR = 0.72, p = 0.048) were risk factors for longer times to surgery.AA and Asian/PI patients as well as those with LEP have significantly longer times to ATL following presurgical evaluation. Future studies should be aimed at identifying the source of these disparities and developing targeted interventions to address them.
