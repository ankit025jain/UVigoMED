{"id":85311,"title":"Interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathway genetics affect disease susceptibility, serum immunoglobulin E levels, and gene expression in asthma.","abstract":"Asthma is a common immune disorder characterized by increased IgE levels. The interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 pathway is central for IgE regulation, and previous studies have reported many genetic variants of IL-4/IL-13 signaling in relation to asthma, but few have focused on the gene-to-gene interactions that are likely to contribute to disease complexity.To assess the combined effects of 7 functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on asthma susceptibility, total serum IgE levels, and gene expression in children.Seven SNPs (rs2243250, rs1800925, rs1805010, rs324011, rs2251746, rs2494262, and rs2427837) were genotyped children with asthma (n = 500) and a control group (n = 523), and total serum IgE levels and gene expressions were measured in children with asthma.Children with asthma had a likelier possibility of carrying more risk genotypes. Mean IgE levels increased from the minimum of 71.07 KU/L in children with no tested polymorphisms to a maximum of 901.7 KU/L in children carrying 7 risk genotypes. Gene expression analysis showed that patients with 4 SNPs (rs2243250, rs1800925, rs1805010, and rs3224011) had higher expression levels of IL-4, IL-13, and STAT6. Moreover, serum IgE level generally correlated well with IL-4 (r = 0.236, P = .011) and IL-13 (r = 0.211, P = .021) expressions; IL-4 expression correlated positively with IL-13 (r = 0.962, P = .000) and STAT6 (r = 0.190, P = .022) expressions, and STAT6 expression correlated with IL-4RA expression (r = 0.904, P = .000).These data suggest that combinations of multiple SNPs might magnify the impact on disease risk. Only a combined analysis of the variants in the IL-4/IL-13 pathway could show the functional interplay of multiple genes in asthma.","date":"2014-07-28","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24980391","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.858805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.817584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.761989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.743313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.707463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.623117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Interleukin 13","weight":0.603433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_13"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.598877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.584906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"STAT6","weight":0.305556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT6"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.287637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.239606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.124145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Polygene","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygene"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0970692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"STAT protein","weight":0.0266043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT_protein"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"}]}
