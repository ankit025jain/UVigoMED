{"id":62169,"title":"Genistein protects hematopoietic stem cells against G-CSF-induced DNA damage.","abstract":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been used to treat neutropenia in various clinical settings. Although clearly beneficial, there are concerns that the chronic use of G-CSF in certain conditions increases the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The most striking example is in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Patients with SCN develop MDS/AML at a high rate that is directly correlated to the cumulative lifetime dosage of G-CSF. Myelodysplastic syndrome and AML that arise in these settings are commonly associated with chromosomal deletions. We have demonstrated in this study that chronic G-CSF treatment in mice results in expansion of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. In addition, primitive hematopoietic progenitors from G-CSF-treated mice show evidence of DNA damage as demonstrated by an increase in double-strand breaks and recurrent chromosomal deletions. Concurrent treatment with genistein, a natural soy isoflavone, limits DNA damage in this population. The protective effect of genistein seems to be related to its preferential inhibition of G-CSF-induced proliferation of HSCs. Importantly, genistein does not impair G-CSF-induced proliferation of committed hematopoietic progenitors, nor diminishes neutrophil production. The protective effect of genistein was accomplished with plasma levels that are attainable through dietary supplementation.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614013","annotations":[{"name":"Genistein","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genistein"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.90973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.783564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.739852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Isoflavones","weight":0.725231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflavones"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.573213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.510971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.484519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.444867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.403867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.358193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.35351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Soybean","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
