{"id":4681,"title":"Interventional sialoendoscopy for treatment of obstructive sialadenitis.","abstract":"This follow-up study documents the overall success rate of interventional sialoendoscopy; it is a novel, less invasive treatment for obstructive sialadenitis.This was a retrospective follow-up study of 189 patients who underwent a sialoendoscopic procedure at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2004 through 2013. Included were patients who underwent sialoendoscopic treatment for symptoms and clinical findings consistent with obstructive sialadenitis. Four different interventional sialoendoscopic techniques were used: dilation of stricture and irrigation, stone retrieval by basket, stone fragmentation with lithotripsy or laser, and stone removal by endoscopic-assisted \"cutdown\" operation using the \"modified McGurk\" technique. The outcome assessed was whether the patient was asymptomatic at 6 months postoperatively.Interventional endoscopic navigation was accomplished in 164 of 189 patients (87%). In 17 cases, the duct orifice was inaccessible owing to scarring, so the duct could not be navigated. Symptomatic relief was achieved in 148 of 164 patients (90%). Dilatation and lavage for sialadenitis without a stone was accomplished in 52 of 189 patients (28%). Sialoliths were retrieved or fragmented in 137 of 164 cases (84%).The results of this study show a high success rate in the treatment of obstructive sialadenitis using interventional sialoendoscopy.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25438275","annotations":[{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.806209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Massachusetts General Hospital","weight":0.742506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Hospital"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.674419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.431511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.206422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Massachusetts","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.180374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.151817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.140536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0539708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0479091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_shock_wave_lithotripsy"},{"name":"Sialadenitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialadenitis"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Rock (geology)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"189","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/189"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"2004 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Basket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Cutdown","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutdown"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Therapeutic irrigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_irrigation"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Habitat fragmentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation"},{"name":"General Hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital"}]}
