{"id":82633,"title":"Role of type I- and type II-interferon in expression of melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 in HSC-3 oral squamous carcinoma cells.","abstract":"Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)are members of DExH family of proteins, and known to play important roles in antiviral responses to induce type I interferons (IFNs). MDA-5 has been thought to sense RNA virus with long(>1 kb) double-stranded RNA. However, MDA-5 is also induced by type II IFN that is involved in acquired immunity, suggesting that role of MDA-5 remains to be elucidated. In addition, no study regarding MDA-5 in oral region has been performed. Here we investigated the role of MDA-5 in HCS-3 squamous carcinoma cells derived from oral epithelial cells. Treatment of HCS-3 cells with IFN-?2b or IFN-? significantly induced MDA-5 as well as RIG-I. IFN-?2b exerted anti-proliferative effect in HSC-3 cells while no such effect was observed in the cells treated with IFN-?. MDA-5 is known to be associated with tumor cell growth in melanoma. However, overexpression of MDA-5 did not alter the proliferation in HSC-3 cells, indicating that MDA-5 is unrelated to the cell growth in this type of cells. We conclude that MDA-5 is induced by both type I- and type II-IFNs in HSC-3 cells, and this suggests MDA-5 may play a role in immune responses in oral cavity.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573197","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.852356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"RNA virus","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.769984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Adaptive immune system","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Base pair","weight":0.669644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.51977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.329805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Protein family","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_family"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Interferon type I","weight":0.121652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I"},{"name":"IFIH1","weight":0.0640699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFIH1"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
