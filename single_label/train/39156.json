Timely establishing of indications for surgery, based on developed criteria, permit to increase the primary reconstructive interventions rate, that promote to improvement of the long-term results and social and occupational rehabilitation. The combination of radical and satisfactory functional results of surgery, we believe the most likely option in the reservoir ileoanal anastomosis formation without traumatizing the anal sphincter and the anorectal area transition. If not perform this operation in one or more stages the method of choice is coloproctectomy and ileostomy.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252408","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anus","weight":0.649408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ileostomy","weight":0.459122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileostomy"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.446188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Ulcerative colitis","weight":0.334541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.263867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.187094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Ulcer (dermatology)","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer_(dermatology)"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.119567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"Sphincter","weight":0.109236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Timely Comics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timely_Comics"},{"name":"Anorectal anomalies","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectal_anomalies"},{"name":"Transitioning (transgender)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitioning_(transgender)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"}]}
