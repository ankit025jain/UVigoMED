{"id":60784,"title":"Anosmia and hypogeusia in Churg-Strauss syndrome.","abstract":"Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare disorder that is often misdiagnosed. In this report we describe a 57-year-old man with Churg-Strauss syndrome who presented with symptoms of lessened smell and taste function that occurred approximately 3 months before the onset of his neurological symptoms. Psychophysical testing using a battery of well-validated smell and taste tests revealed that the patient had total anosmia and marked hypogeusia. While one anecdotal report exists in the Spanish literature that alludes to the presence of anosmia in a single case of this syndrome, no further confirmation of such dysfunction has appeared in the literature. These findings support the concept that smell and taste loss may be an early sign of this disorder.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825557","annotations":[{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.739708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.383217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.359066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.288159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Olfaction","weight":0.252656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"},{"name":"Anecdotal evidence","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence"},{"name":"Anosmia","weight":0.137801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosmia"},{"name":"Medical error","weight":0.127776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error"},{"name":"Spanish language","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.0508378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Rare disease","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_disease"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Spanish literature","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_literature"},{"name":"Hypogeusia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogeusia"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"}]}
