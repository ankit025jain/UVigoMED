{"id":63491,"title":"The levels of adhesion molecules in essential thrombocythemia.","abstract":"It is known that thrombocytosis is closely related to vascular complications and particularly thrombosis in essential thrombocytemia (ET) cases. The aim of this study is to investigate a possible correlation between adhesion molecules and vascular attacks as well as the relation of these molecules to the platelet count.The study group consisted of 30 ET patients and 30 healthy controls subjects. Serum intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), serum vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and serum E-selectin levels were determined by ELISA method according to manufacturer's instructions.There were no significant differences between two groups with respect to levels of sICAM-1 and sE-selectin (P>0.05). The VCAM-1 levels and platelets were significantly higher in patients with ET compared to controls (P=0.000). Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that sVCAM-1 levels were correlated with platelet counts (r=0.574, P<0.001) CONCLUSION: High VCAM-1 level in ET and its correlation with the platelet count suggest that these may be a factor in vascular complications and thrombocytosis.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434346","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Essential thrombocytosis","weight":0.841175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.717121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.625791,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Cell adhesion molecule","weight":0.614156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.489279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.482015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Thrombocytosis","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytosis"},{"name":"ICAM-1","weight":0.350039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAM-1"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.310454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.285378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"VCAM-1","weight":0.13109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCAM-1"},{"name":"Platelet count","weight":0.0934771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet_count"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Canonical correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Intercellular adhesion molecule","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercellular_adhesion_molecule"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"}]}
