{"id":46392,"title":"Octreotide stimulates somatostatin receptor-induced apoptosis of SW480 colon cancer cells by activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3?, A Wnt/?-catenin pathway modulator.","abstract":"Peptide hormone somatostatin and its receptors (SSTRs) have a wide range of physiological functions and play a role in the treatment of numerous human diseases, including colorectal cancer. Octreotide, a somatostatin-analog peptide, inhibits growth of colonic cancer SW480 cells through Wnt/?-catenin pathway modulation. However, the specific octreotide-stimulating SSTR subtypes and the signal-transduction mechanism responsible for the negative regulation of Wnt/?-catenin pathway by octreotide have not been fully elucidated.Octreotide-induced apoptosis in SW480 colon cancer cells mediated by SSTR2,SSTR5-dependent regulation of the Wnt/?-catenin pathway components GSK-3? and ?-catenin was investigated. Cell apoptosis of SW480 cells was measured by apoptosis-DNA ladder assay. SSTR1, SSTR2, SSTR3, SSTR4, and SSTR5 mRNA expression levels were confirmed by RT-PCR; ?-catenin, TCF-4, cyclin D1, c-Myc, and GSK-3? protein levels were examined by Western blot. The distribution of ?-catenin in the cell was analyzed with immunocytochemistry.Octreotide treatment increased SSTR2,SSTR5-induced apoptosis of SW480 colon cancer cells, promoted the plasma membrane accumulation of ?-catenin, inactivated T-cell factor-dependent transcription, and downregulated Wnt target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Further, octreotide treatment mediated the activation of GSK-3.These preliminary findings showed the negative regulation of the Wnt/?-catenin pathway by peptide hormone G protein-coupled receptors SSTRs.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System
