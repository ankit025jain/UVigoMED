{"id":61690,"title":"[Henoch-Schönlein recurrent purpura: case report].","abstract":"A 15-year old patient presented several episodes of uncontrollable vomiting with abdominal pain caused by a recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Renal impairment was demonstrated through the achievement of urinary test strips. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common vasculitis in children. The clinical picture may include palpable purpura despite normal coagulation, arthralgia, abdominal pain and some degree of renal impairment. Most often, symptomatic treatment is effective. In some severe cases, corticosteroids are required. A control of hematuria and measure of blood pressure are recommended during the 6 to 12 months following the initial episode.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683839","annotations":[{"name":"Arthralgia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia"},{"name":"Hematuria","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematuria"},{"name":"Vasculitis","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.75769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Abdominal pain","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"},{"name":"Vomiting","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Purpura","weight":0.3941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Symptomatic treatment","weight":0.320808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"}]}
