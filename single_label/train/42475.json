{"id":42475,"title":"Section 9. Technical details of microsurgical biliary reconstruction in living donor liver transplantation.","abstract":"Small size and multiple ducts, particularly in right lobe liver grafts, are major factors that contribute to biliary complications in living donor liver transplantation. To improve the outcome of biliary reconstruction, further investigation and refinement of reconstruction techniques and management strategies are necessary. From March 2006 to June 2012, routine MBR was performed in 584 grafts in 581 consecutive LDLT (including 3 dual graft transplants). All biliary reconstructions were performed using microsurgical technique by a single microsurgeon. The classification of biliary reconstruction was based according to the number of ducts in the graft, the manner in which these ducts were reconstructed (with or without ductoplasty), and the conduit used (recipient duct or jejunum) to reconstruct the biliary tree. In duct-to-duct reconstruction, posterior wall first technique by using interrupted suture and continuous running and interrupted tie technique (combined method) for the anterior wall were performed. Recipient reduction ductoplasty was done, if necessary. In duct-to-jejunum reconstruction, enterotomy was performed first under microscope; then, the serosal and mucosal layers were sutured together using 8-0 prolene to facilitate the anastomosis. Posterior wall first by using interrupted suture technique and combined method for the anterior wall were also performed. Overall, there were 397 right and 184 left lobe grafts. Single duct opening was noted in 440 (75.34%), two duct openings in 135(23.12%), and three duct openings in 9 (1.54%) grafts. Duct-to-duct anastomosis was performed in 473 (81%) and duct-to-jejunum Roux limb in 111 (19%) biliary reconstructions. Size discrepancy in the graft and recipient ducts was noted in 394 (83.3%) reconstructions. The overall biliary complication was 7.9%. These included 19 (3.3%) bile leaks and 27 (4.6%) biliary strictures. The routine use of MBR capably surmounts the difficulties brought about by the anatomic variations and the size discrepancies between the graft and recipient hepatic ducts with excellent outcome.
