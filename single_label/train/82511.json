{"id":82511,"title":"Clinical and scanning electron microscopy evaluation of the Er,Cr:YSGG laser therapy for treating dentine hypersensitivity: short-term, randomised, controlled study.","abstract":"Er,Cr:YSGG laser is a rising treatment option for dentine hypersensitivity (DH). However, there is no data available concerning the scanning electron microscope (SEM) evaluation of the clinical application of Er,Cr:YSGG laser in the treatment of DH. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the desensitising and tubule occlusion effects of Er,Cr:YSGG laser with different power settings. Twenty patients (60 teeth) participated in this study. For each patient, teeth were randomised to 3 groups. In groups 1 and 2, patients were treated with Er,Cr:YSGG laser at 0.25 and 0.5 W, respectively. In control group, same laser was applied without laser emission. DH was assessed for all groups with a visual analogue scale (VAS). When compared with the baseline data and control group, in both active treatment groups laser irradiation provided a desensitising effect immediately after treatment (P < 0.001). In group 2, VAS scores were significantly lower than group 1. The tubule diameters in the both laser groups were significantly smaller than the control group (P < 0.01). When group 1 compared with group 2, group 2 showed significantly smaller tubule diameters (P < 0.001). Both 0.25 and 0.5 W laser irradiation were effective for the treatment of DH; however, 0.5 W laser irradiation showed best results for the decrease in VAS scores. The SEM findings of the reduction in number/patency of dentine tubules seem to be related to the clinical findings, which were associated with improvement in treatment efficacy.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602082","annotations":[{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.809271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.678393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.632587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.629135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.512277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.500373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Laser medicine","weight":0.467419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_medicine"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.44917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.439257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.41342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.389095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.14751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Dentine hypersensitivity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentine_hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Chromium","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Designated hitter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Tubule","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubule"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Electric power","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Vascular occlusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_occlusion"},{"name":"Europium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europium"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Emission spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
