{"id":67370,"title":"Insulin sensitivity and albuminuria: the RISC study.","abstract":"Accumulating evidence suggests an association between insulin sensitivity and albuminuria, which, even in the normal range, is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. We evaluated whether insulin sensitivity is associated with albuminuria in healthy subjects.We investigated 1,415 healthy, nondiabetic participants (mean age 43.9 Â± 8.3 years; 54.3% women) from the RISC (Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease) study, of whom 852 participated in a follow-up examination after 3 years. At baseline, insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, expressed as the M/I value. Oral glucose tolerance test-based insulin sensitivity (OGIS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were determined at baseline and follow-up.Microalbuminuria (UACR ?30 mg/g) was present in fewer than 2% at either study visit. After multivariate adjustments, there was no cross-sectional association between UACR and any measure of insulin sensitivity. Neither OGIS nor HOMA-IR was significantly associated with follow-up UACR, but in a multivariate regression analysis, baseline M/I emerged as an independent predictor of UACR at follow-up (?-coefficient -0.14; P = 0.001).In healthy middle-aged adults, reduced insulin sensitivity, assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, is continuously associated with a greater risk of increasing albuminuria. This finding suggests that reduced insulin sensitivity either is simply related to or might causally contribute to the initial pathogenesis of albuminuria.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623021","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.883669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.748245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.550962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.430845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.208106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.0875503,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Microalbuminuria","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microalbuminuria"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.0250533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
