{"id":68513,"title":"Targeting of receptor for advanced glycation end products suppresses cyst growth in polycystic kidney disease.","abstract":"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited renal disorder. Although a myriad of research groups have attempted to identify a new therapeutic target for ADPKD, no drug has worked well in clinical trials. Our research group has focused on the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) gene as a novel target for ADPKD. This gene is involved in inflammation and cell proliferation. We have already confirmed that blocking RAGE function attenuates cyst growth in vitro. Based on this previous investigation, our group examined the effect of RAGE on cyst enlargement in vivo. PC2R mice, a severe ADPKD mouse model that we generated, were utilized. An adenovirus containing anti-RAGE shRNA was injected intravenously into this model. We observed that RAGE gene knockdown resulted in loss of kidney weight and volume. Additionally, the cystic area that originated from different nephron segments decreased in size because of down-regulation of the RAGE gene. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values tended to be lower after inhibiting RAGE. Based on these results, we confirmed that the RAGE gene could be an effective target for ADPKD treatment.
