{"id":51009,"title":"Evidence of brain tumor stem progenitor-like cells with low proliferative capacity in human benign pituitary adenoma.","abstract":"Tumor stem cells have been implicated as cancer-initiating cells in malignant brain tumors. However, whether benign brain tumors also contain tumor stem cells are largely unexplored. Here, we investigated whether tumor stem-like cells were present in pituitary adenoma similar to malignant brain tumors. By immunocytochemistry, we found that pituitary adenoma tissues expressed neural stem cell marker. These cells could form neurospheres in vitro, expressed neural stem/progenitor cell markers and generated daughter cells with the capacity to differentiate into three neural lineages. Importantly, compared with non-invasive pituitary adenomas, we found that CD133 expression was significantly increased in invasive pituitary adenomas, suggesting that the proliferative capacity was correlated with the malignance of pituitary adenomas. Finally, invasive pituitary adenomas cells displayed lower proliferative ability than glioblastoma. Our data indicate that a subpopulation of stem/progenitor-like cells are present in pituitary adenomas, and these cells may be responsible for benign tumor initiation and maintenance.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732807","annotations":[{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.815556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Glioblastoma multiforme","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Benign tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.662928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.633697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Neural stem cell","weight":0.626988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_stem_cell"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.434398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Cluster of differentiation","weight":0.0469253,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_of_differentiation"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"}]}
