{"id":91929,"title":"Evaluation of a method for the assessment of anterior acetabular coverage and hip joint space width.","abstract":"The false-profile view (FP) is an oblique view of the acetabulum and a true lateral view of femur and joint. It evaluates anterior and posterior hip joint space width (JSW) and anterior acetabular coverage using the vertical-center margin angle (VCA). The biplanar slot scanner (SS) allows simultaneous bilateral acquisitions of oblique views of hip joints. The aim of this work was to compare SS versus FP for the evaluation of VCA and JSW and to test its reproducibility and validity.A prospective study of 28 patients (55 hips) with hip pain was performed from November 2011 until May 2012. Two readers measured VCA and JSW. JSW was normalized by the diameter of the femoral head for each technique. The radiation exposure was recorded and compared between the two modalities. Student's t test and the Pearson's correlation assessed the agreement between SS and FP. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the interobserver agreement.The mean VCA angle was 32.1° (± 7.1°) and 30.3° (± 8.5°) with FP and SS, respectively. The coefficient of correlation was 0.90 (p?<?0.01). The coefficient of correlation of normalized JSW was 0.83, 0.85, and 0.87 at anterior, vertical, and posterior points, respectively). The ICC was between 0.69 and 0.81 for each modality. The mean radiation exposure was 1.33 (± 0.02) mGy versus 8.69 (±0.04) mGy for FP and SS, respectively (p?<?0.0001).SS has the potential advantages of simultaneous bilateral acquisition, higher standardization, and is less irradiating. SS is reliable for coxometry.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463779","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.503681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.291941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.0925639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Intraclass correlation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraclass_correlation"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Standard score","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"International Cricket Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"7.1 surround sound","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.1_surround_sound"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Morleys (department store)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morleys_(department_store)"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Student's t-test","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test"},{"name":"Variable-gain amplifier","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-gain_amplifier"},{"name":"Auto racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
