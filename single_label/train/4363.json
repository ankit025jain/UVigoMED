{"id":4363,"title":"[Epidemiological analysis of imported malaria prevalence in Luoyang City from 2010 to 2013].","abstract":"To understand the epidemiological characteristics of imported malaria in Luoyang City, so as to provide the evidence for malaria prevention and control in this city.The Epidemic situation data from network reports, as well as the case survey and the epidemiological investigation data of imported malaria were collected and analyzed in Luoyang City from 2010 to 2013.A total of 98 imported malaria cases were reported in Luoyang City from 2010 to 2013, including 35 cases of vivax malaria, 57 cases of falciparum malaria, 4 cases of ovale malaria and 2 cases of quartan malaria. All the cases were confirmed by laboratory detection. Seventy-one cases (72.44%) returned from African countries, and 27 (27.55%) cases returned from Southeast Asian countries. The majority cases were young man, and 78.57% of the cases were diagnosed by different levels of centers for disease control and prevention. There was no significant seasonal variation in onset time. The median time from onset to seeing doctor was 6 days.The epidemic situation of imported malaria is quite serious in Luoyang City. It is necessary to further strengthen the professional training and multi-sectoral cooperation, and take effective pre- vention and control measures to reduce the hazard of imported malaria.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434136","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.811179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.67526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"City","weight":0.562499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.556612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Africa","weight":0.419312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.413385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.399841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.244962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Plasmodium vivax","weight":0.03935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Plasmodium malariae","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_malariae"},{"name":"Luoyang","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luoyang"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Television network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_network"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Plasmodium ovale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale"},{"name":"Malaria prophylaxis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_prophylaxis"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"}]}
