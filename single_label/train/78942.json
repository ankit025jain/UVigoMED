{"id":78942,"title":"Patient-centred audiological rehabilitation: perspectives of older adults who own hearing aids.","abstract":"Patient-centred care is a term frequently associated with quality health care. Despite extensive literature from a range of health-care professions that provide description and measurement of patient-centred care, a definition of patient-centredness in audiological rehabilitation is lacking. The current study aimed to define patient-centred care specific to audiological rehabilitation from the perspective of older adults who have owned hearing aids for at least one year.Research interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of older adults concerning their perceptions of patient-centredness in audiological rehabilitation, and qualitative content analysis was undertaken.The participant sample included ten adults over the age of 60 years who had owned hearing aids for at least one year.Data analysis revealed three dimensions to patient-centred audiological rehabilitation: the therapeutic relationship, the players (audiologist and patient), and clinical processes. Individualised care was seen as an overarching theme linking each of these dimensions.This study reported two models: the first model describes what older adults with hearing aids believe constitutes patient-centred audiological rehabilitation. The second provides a guide to operationalised patient-centred care. Further research is required to address questions pertaining to the presence, nature, and impact of patient-centred audiological rehabilitation.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528290","annotations":[{"name":"Perception","weight":0.681782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.491223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.482016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.471201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.449573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Data analysis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Nature","weight":0.329879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"},{"name":"Audiology","weight":0.257246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.158256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.147108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Nonprobability sampling","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprobability_sampling"},{"name":"Content analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Therapeutic relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_relationship"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Hearing aid","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_aid"},{"name":"Concept album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Purpose","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"}]}
