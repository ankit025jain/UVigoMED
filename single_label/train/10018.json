{"id":10018,"title":"microRNA-21 protects against ischemia-reperfusion and hypoxia-reperfusion-induced cardiocyte apoptosis via the phosphatase and tensin homolog/Akt-dependent mechanism.","abstract":"Myocardial tissue injury caused by ischemia and hypoxia is a major cause of fatal diseases, including coronary atherosclerosis resulting from myocardial infarction and stroke. A number of microRNAs have been demonstrated to function as protectors against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and/or hypoxia-reperfusion (H/R)-induced myocardial injury, including microRNA-21 (miR-21). However, the protective mechanism of miR-21 has not been fully elucidated. The present study demonstrated that miR-21 had an anti-apoptotic role in I/R-induced myocardial damage in vivo and in H/R-induced H9C2 cell death in vitro. Of note, the present study indicates that a common molecular mechanism is likely to exist in I/R- and H/R-induced cardiocyte apoptosis. During I/R and H/R, forced expression of miR-21 upregulated the Akt signaling activity via suppressing the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the increased activity of Akt signaling further inhibited apoptosis partially by increasing the ratio of B-cell lymphoma 2(Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein, which further suppressed the expression of caspase-3. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, it was shown for the first time that miR-21 had a protective role in I/R- and H/R-induced cardiocyte apoptosis via the PTEN/Akt-dependent mechanism. The present study indicates that miR-21 may be a promising agent for the treatment of I/R and H/R-induced myocardial injury.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676391","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.924931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.821376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.767658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.767376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Programmed cell death","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.683277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.679559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.655844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.617209,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.53219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.525721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.445037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.400588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.391223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.372123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0782123,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"}]}
