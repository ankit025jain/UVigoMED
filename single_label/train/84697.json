{"id":84697,"title":"[Assessment of pain relief in patients receiving different variants of multimodal analgesia after major gynecological surgery].","abstract":"The major gynecology surgery generally results in severe postoperative pain. Currently multimodal analgesia concept is widely used for the aim of postoperative pain relief optimization. According to this theory it is worth using the medication with different mechanism in order to increase analgesia qualify, decrease analgesic consumption and avoid adverse reaction. Unfortunately the surveys recently conducted have been pointed out the postoperative analgesia quality is still insufficient despite of using the concept mentioned above. One way to solve the problem is appearing in daily practice nefopam--centrally acting non-opioid analgesic that inhibits reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine and also mitigates glutamatergic neurotransmission. In this trial we tried to assess the postoperative daily used analgesia quality and potency of preemptive multimodal analgesia model consisted of nefopam, ketoprofen, paracetamol and morphine.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055490","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Morphine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine"},{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Dopamine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine"},{"name":"Nefopam","weight":0.831565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefopam"},{"name":"Neurotransmission","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmission"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.813197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Glutamic acid","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Reuptake","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuptake"},{"name":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.740246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Ketoprofen","weight":0.493984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoprofen"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.147895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
