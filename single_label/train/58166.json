{"id":58166,"title":"Long-term surgical outcomes of vaginal sacrospinous ligament fixation in women with pelvic organ prolapse.","abstract":"Few studies have demonstrated the effects of the sacrospinous ligament fixation (SLF) in the long-term period. Aim of the study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of SLF.This was a longitudinal cohort study. Fifty-one patients who had undergone SLF were evaluated postoperatively at 1 and 7 years. The characteristics of patients, intra- and postoperative complications, length of hospital stay period, short and long-term outcomes of the surgeries were recorded. Objective success was evaluated by vaginal and POP-Q examination at 1 and 7 years postoperatively.Out of 51 patients, 46 (90.19%) patients underwent vaginal hysterectomy, 36 (70.58%) patients anterior colporrhaphy, 31 (60.78%) patients posterior colporrhaphy and 11 (21.56%) patients transobturator tape concomitantly with SLF. The differences of Aa, Ba, Ap, Bp and total vaginal length (TVL) scores between preoperative, postoperative at 1 and 7 years were statistically significant (P<0.001). Cystocele rate, at 1 year and at 7 years, were 8 out of 51 (15.68%) and 9 out of 35 (25.71%), respectively. The objective cure rate for the apical vaginal vault prolapse at 1 year and at 7 years were 96% (49/51) and 94.28% (33 /35), respectively.SLF is an appropriate and safe treatment procedure in patients with vaginal vault prolapse in the seven years of follow-up period.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24987972","annotations":[{"name":"Hysterectomy","weight":0.837143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.649203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.525405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Cystocele","weight":0.468637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystocele"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.401802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Prolapse","weight":0.389924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse"},{"name":"Vaginal vault","weight":0.285993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_vault"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Female genital prolapse","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_prolapse"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0574663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Sacrospinous ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrospinous_ligament"},{"name":"Videotape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape"},{"name":"Length of stay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_stay"},{"name":"Labour Party (Norway)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Norway)"},{"name":"Aim (musician)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_(musician)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Fixation (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_(psychology)"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Television lines","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_lines"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Super low frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_low_frequency"}]}
