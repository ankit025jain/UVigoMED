{"id":69373,"title":"Association of interleukin-10 gene promoter polymorphisms with susceptibility to acute pyelonephritis in children.","abstract":"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a potent inhibitor of leukocyte chemotaxis, bacterial killing in phagocytes and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and recent studies have suggested an important role for this immunoregulatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Therefore, the gene encoding IL-10 (IL10) is an attractive candidate for association studies attempting to identify susceptibility genes conferring risk of UTIs. In this case-control study, we aimed to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of IL10 with acute pyelonephritis in the Slovak population. Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers was used to analyse IL10 -1082A/G (rs1800896), -819C/T (rs1800871) and -592C/A (rs1800872) SNPs in 147 children with acute pyelonephritis and 215 healthy controls. Comparison of patients with healthy controls using the logistic regression analysis revealed significantly increased risk of developing recurrent attacks of acute pyelonephritis for -1082 G allele in a dominant genetic model GG (GG + AG vs. AA, P = 0.019, odds ratio (OR)?= 2.26). A similar tendency was also found when the recurrent acute pyelonephritis subgroup was compared to episodic pyelonephritis cases (GG + AG vs. AA, P = 0.009, OR = 3.38). In conclusion, our results suggest that IL10 -1082 A/G SNP is a susceptibility factor for development of recurrent attacks of acute pyelonephritis.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital
