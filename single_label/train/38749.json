{"id":38749,"title":"Perioperative levels of tumor necrosis factor-? correlate with outcomes in children and adults with tetralogy of Fallot undergoing corrective surgery.","abstract":"Previous studies reporting on tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) as a marker of inflammatory response (IR) in patients with congenital heart disease were limited by small sample size and variability in diagnosis. We report perioperative changes in TNF-? levels and their correlation with preoperative factors and clinical outcomes in a large homogenous group of patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) undergoing definitive repair at a tertiary care center.A total of 167 patients were divided into four groups on the basis of age. Group 1 included infants less than 1 year, group 2 included children between 1 and 12 years, group 3 included adolescents between 12 and 18 years, and group 4 included adults more than 18 years of age. Serum TNF-? levels were measured at three time points and correlated with perioperative variables.The baseline TNF-? level correlated with patients' nutritional status and degree of cyanosis in all four groups. The magnitude of IR in the postcardiopulmonary bypass (post-CPB) period as measured by TNF-? level was much higher and correlated more consistently with adverse clinical outcomes in the younger age group (groups 1 and 2). On multivariable analysis; age at operation, preoperative degree of hypoxemia and TNF-? levels were found to be independent predictors of clinical outcomes.We demonstrated a rise in serum TNF-? levels in patients with TOF undergoing definitive repair on CPB, which correlated with preoperative severity of cyanosis, nutritional status, and adverse clinical outcomes. The TNF-? levels may be monitored to identify cyanotic patients at an increased risk of exhibiting augmented IR to CPB.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403353","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoxemia","weight":0.92372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemia"},{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.805458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.800429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.508726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.436479,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.420555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.12701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.124581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Sample size determination","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Breast implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_implant"},{"name":"Higher education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
