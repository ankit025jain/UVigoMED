{"id":72310,"title":"Third-line trabectedin for a metastatic desmoplastic small round cell tumour treated with multimodal therapy.","abstract":"Desmoplastic small round cell tumour (DSRCT) is a rare and aggressive cancer that usually develops in the peritoneal cavity of young males. Its prognosis is dismal, with current treatment options including the combination of multi-agent chemotherapy, aggressive surgery, radiation therapy, and autologous stem cell transplantation. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may also be an option.Herein we report the administration of the marine-derived multi-target antineoplastic agent, trabectedin, in a patient with DSRCT, heavily pre-treated with conventional multi-agent chemotherapy, HIPEC, and surgery.The patient achieved a prolonged partial response and an extended period of stable disease with third-line trabectedin, following disease progression after conventional multi-agent chemotherapy, HIPEC, and surgery.Trabectedin may be a treatment option in multimodal therapy for the management of DSRCT and warrants further research to explore the impact of trabectedin in the treatment of this disease.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982387","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.852905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Autologous stem cell transplantation","weight":0.650518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autologous_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Peritoneal cavity","weight":0.619889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_cavity"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.546683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.350379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Desmoplastic fibroma","weight":0.341371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmoplastic_fibroma"},{"name":"Trabectedin","weight":0.252069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabectedin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.155994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Multimodal therapy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_therapy"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Glossary of professional wrestling terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"}]}
