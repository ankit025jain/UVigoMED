{"id":26556,"title":"Deficiency of cardiomyocyte-specific microRNA-378 contributes to the development of cardiac fibrosis involving a transforming growth factor ? (TGF?1)-dependent paracrine mechanism.","abstract":"Understanding the regulation of cardiac fibrosis is critical for controlling adverse cardiac remodeling during heart failure. Previously we identified miR-378 as a cardiomyocyte-abundant miRNA down-regulated in several experimental models of cardiac hypertrophy and in patients with heart failure. To understand the consequence of miR-378 down-regulation during cardiac remodeling, our current study employed a locked nucleic acid-modified antimiR to target miR-378 in vivo. Results showed development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in mouse hearts. Mechanistically, miR-378 depletion was found to induce TGF?1 expression in mouse hearts and in cultured cardiomyocytes. Among various secreted cytokines in the conditioned-media of miR-378-depleted cardiomyocytes, only TGF?1 levels were found to be increased. The increase was prevented by miR-378 expression. Treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with the conditioned media of miR-378-depleted myocytes activated pSMAD2/3 and induced fibrotic gene expression. This effect was counteracted by including a TGF?1-neutralizing antibody in the conditioned-medium. In cardiomyocytes, adenoviruses expressing dominant negative N-Ras or c-Jun prevented antimiR-mediated induction of TGF?1 mRNA, documenting the importance of Ras and AP-1 signaling in this response. Our study demonstrates that reduction of miR-378 during pathological conditions contributes to cardiac remodeling by promoting paracrine release of profibrotic cytokine, TGF?1 from cardiomyocytes. Our data imply that the presence in cardiomyocyte of miR-378 plays a critical role in the protection of neighboring fibroblasts from activation by pro-fibrotic stimuli.
