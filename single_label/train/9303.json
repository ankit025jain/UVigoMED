{"id":9303,"title":"The chemerin receptor 23 agonist, chemerin, attenuates monosynaptic C-fibre input to lamina I neurokinin 1 receptor expressing rat spinal cord neurons in inflammatory pain.","abstract":"Recent evidence has shown that the chemerin receptor 23 (ChemR23) represents a novel inflammatory pain target, whereby the ChemR23 agonists, resolvin E1 and chemerin, can inhibit inflammatory pain hypersensitivity, by a mechanism that involves normalisation of potentiated spinal cord responses. This study has examined the ability of the ChemR23 agonist, chemerin, to modulate synaptic input to lamina I neurokinin 1 receptor expressing (NK1R+) dorsal horn neurons, which are known to be crucial for the manifestation of inflammatory pain.Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from pre-identified lamina I NK1R+ neurons, in rat spinal cord slices, revealed that chemerin significantly attenuates capsaicin potentiation of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency, but is without effect in non-potentiated conditions. In tissue isolated from complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) treated rats, chemerin significantly reduced the peak amplitude of monosynaptic C-fibre evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) in a subset of lamina I NK1R+ neurons, termed chemerin responders. However, chemerin did not alter the peak amplitude of monosynaptic C-fibre eEPSCs in control tissue. Furthermore, paired-pulse recordings in CFA tissue demonstrated that chemerin significantly reduced paired-pulse depression in the subset of neurons classified as chemerin responders, but was without effect in non-responders, indicating that chemerin acts presynaptically to attenuate monosynaptic C-fibre input to a subset of lamina I NK1R+ neurons.These results suggest that the reported ability of ChemR23 agonists to attenuate inflammatory pain hypersensitivity may in part be due to a presynaptic inhibition of monosynaptic C-fibre input to lamina I NK1R+ neurons and provides further evidence that ChemR23 represents a promising inflammatory pain target.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716552","annotations":[{"name":"Posterior horn of spinal cord","weight":0.922164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Capsaicin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin"},{"name":"Chemical synapse","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synapse"},{"name":"Excitatory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.767299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Tachykinin receptor 1","weight":0.660967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachykinin_receptor_1"},{"name":"Neuromodulation","weight":0.660728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.510982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.383037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.243592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Tachykinin peptides","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachykinin_peptides"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.198175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.131485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0771373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Resolvins","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolvins"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
