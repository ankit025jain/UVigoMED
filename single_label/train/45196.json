{"id":45196,"title":"Evaluation of the seventh AJCC TNM staging system for gastric cancer: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.","abstract":"The AJCC seventh edition TNM classification for gastric cancer was released in 2010 and included major revision. Large-volume gastric cancer centers have evaluated the prognostic significance of the new system and obtained paradoxical results. The authors performed a meta-analysis of these studies to evaluate the new classification. Fifteen eligible studies with 38,972 patients were included in the analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95 % confidence intervals were extracted from identified studies. The primary outcome was overall survival. The HRs for the seventh edition T classification and N classification were found to increase steadily and reasonably. The cumulative survival rates of the seventh edition subgroups of T classifications demonstrated obvious differences; meanwhile, the differences between subgroups of N classifications including N3a and N3b categories were also significant. The 5-year survival rates according to the seventh edition TNM staging system were 94.71 % (stage IA), 88.72 % (stage IB), 80.45 % (stage IIA), 67.24 % (stage IIB), 53.68 % (stage IIIA), 37.56 % (stage IIIB), and 21.26 % (stage IIIC), respectively. The results of this study indicate that the seventh edition of the TNM classification was considered valid, although further evaluation was needed for N3a and N3b categories.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696259","annotations":[{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.783461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.776736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.724116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.574749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"American Joint Committee on Cancer","weight":0.461308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Joint_Committee_on_Cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.461053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.334485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.173181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Paradox","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Home run","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"972","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/972"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Type II string theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_string_theory"},{"name":"Institute of Internal Auditors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Internal_Auditors"},{"name":"2010 Micronesian Games","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Micronesian_Games"},{"name":"Iowa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Super Bowl VII","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_VII"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Group 3 element","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_3_element"},{"name":"International Baccalaureate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate"}]}
