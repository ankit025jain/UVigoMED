{"id":31289,"title":"A tuberculosis outbreak fueled by cross-border travel and illicit substances: Nevada and Arizona.","abstract":"From May 2006 to August 2008, the Southern Nevada Health District identified eight tuberculosis (TB) cases in six adults and two children in a Hispanic community. We conducted an outbreak investigation to determine the extent of TB transmission and prevent additional cases.We investigated TB cases in Nevada and Arizona with the outbreak genotype or cases with suspected epidemiologic links to this cluster but without genotyping data. We reviewed medical records and interviewed patients and contacts. Subsequently, genotype surveillance was conducted for approximately four years to monitor additional outbreak-related cases.Eight outbreak cases were identified among six adults and two children. All patients were Hispanic and five were U.S.-born. The index patient was diagnosed while detained in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody but deported before treatment completion. He was lost to follow-up for two years, during which time he served as the source for six secondary TB cases, including his own child. Along with the index patient, five patients reportedly engaged in the sale or use of methamphetamine. Follow-up surveillance in the two states identified eight additional cases with the outbreak genotype; three had epidemiologic links to the index case.We found that incomplete TB treatment led to extensive TB transmission. We recommend thorough discharge planning and active measures to ensure continuity of care and TB treatment completion for people in custody at higher risk for loss to follow-up, which likely includes those engaged in the sale or use of illicit substances.","date":"2014-01-01","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24381363","annotations":[{"name":"Methamphetamine","weight":0.854644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.814605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.63612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Arizona","weight":0.626864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.58647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.487259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.433721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.368158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Immigration","weight":0.315465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"},{"name":"Hispanic and Latino Americans","weight":0.298854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans"},{"name":"Nevada","weight":0.274279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.270315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.138662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.106265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Deportation","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Customs","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"},{"name":"Travel","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prohibition of drugs","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Index case","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_case"},{"name":"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement"},{"name":"Child custody","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_custody"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"}]}
