{"id":62975,"title":"High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation for elderly patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma: a nationwide retrospective study.","abstract":"The number of elderly patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) continues to increase but the data regarding autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for elderly patients are limited. We analyzed 484 patients, ages 60 years or over, diagnosed with relapsed/refractory DLBCL who received ASCT from 1993 to 2010 in the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation database. Median age was 64 years (range, 60 to 78). To evaluate the impact of age at ASCT, patients were classified into 3 groups: those between the ages of 60 to 64, 65 to 69, and 70 years or over. Overall nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at day 100, 1 year, and 2 years was 4.1%, 5.9% and 7.7%, respectively. NRM did not significantly differ among age groups (P = .60). Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 48% and 58%, respectively. PFS and OS were significantly longer in patients 60 to 64 years old; however, the survival rate was acceptable even in those 70 or over, with a 2-year OS of 46%. ASCT is feasible in selected elderly patients and age alone should not be a contraindication for ASCT. Eligibility should be individualized and identification of a subset of elderly patients at high risk of treatment-related morbidity or mortality warrants investigation.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492141","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.823007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.735604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.641896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.559834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.470113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.430792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.430036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.273712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.182524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Autologous stem cell transplantation","weight":0.141968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autologous_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.090579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0331112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"1993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Warrant (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(finance)"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"B-cell lymphoma","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_lymphoma"},{"name":"Japan Society (New York)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Society_(New_York)"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
