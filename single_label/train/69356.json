{"id":69356,"title":"[Dominance status of shape of male genitalia in interspecific crosses of some Drosophila virilis group species].","abstract":"The heritability of the shape of the main species-specific morphological trait for the Drosophila virilis group--the male mating organ has been analyzed using the hybrid males D. virilis x D. lummei and D. virilis x D. novamexicana. The results suggest an increase in the share of the characters with a recessive status in the evolutionarily younger species and demonstrate the role of sex chromosomes in the implementation of a dominant or recessive status of the trait. The roles of additive and epistatic components of the total variation in the evolution of dominance status, shown in several known theoretical models and confirmed by our data, are considered. The published data on sterility of hybrid males in interspecific crosses are discussed from the standpoint of the evolution of dominance.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450191","annotations":[{"name":"Drosophila","weight":0.86061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Heritability","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Epistasis","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sex-determination system","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Mating","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Phenotypic trait","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.693322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.409074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.238395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.137978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Interspecific competition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interspecific_competition"}]}
