{"id":65156,"title":"[Varicocele in second adulthood and elderly men].","abstract":"The prevalence ofvaricocele in second adulthood and elderly men was evaluated. It was found that varicocele in this age group occurs in 15.8 % of cases , whereas in men up to 35 years - in 18.3 % of cases. 88.5 % of men older than 35 years had children. Varicocele is often asymptomatic. The course of varicocele includes compensation and decompensation stages. Proportion of adulthood and elderly patients with decompensated stage ofvaricocele in the structure ofurological disease was 0.34 %. Pain is the main manifestation of varicocele at the stage of decompensation in second adulthood and elderly men. For surgical correction of varicocele in such patients, Sayfan technique seems appropriate, which uses transinguinal mini assess (2.5-3 cm incision) allowing to identify and eliminate most of the possible causes of pain: infantile hernia, benign tumors of adipose tissue, fibrotic changes in the tissues along the ilioinguinal nerve. This minimally invasive technique can be used in outpatient surgery. 18 patients underwent surgery using this technique. There were no early postoperative and long-term complications. At 1 to 3 years after surgery, 13 patients were re-examined, and relapses were not revealed.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956673","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.780388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.742555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.728213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.714336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.653015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Varicocele","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicocele"},{"name":"Outpatient surgery","weight":0.0197357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient_surgery"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"}]}
