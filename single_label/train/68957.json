{"id":68957,"title":"Recent advances in the treatment of neurogenic erectile dysfunction.","abstract":"Neurogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) can be broadly defined as an inability to sustain or maintain a penile erection owing to a neurological impairment, either centrally or peripherally or both. Although significant advances in the pharmacological treatment of ED have occurred in recent years, especially after the introduction of oral selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, the treatment of neurological patients with ED may be challenging for prescribers, given poor data available on this topic and the variety of etiologic factors (iatrogenic, endocrine, psychiatric and psychosocial) to consider. At the same time, several, new oral, local and surgical treatments are available and their efficacy and safety depend on the specific cases. This review provides a comprehensive and updated description of current and future ED therapies, including assigned patents, with a special focus on the treatment of neurogenic erectile dysfunction.
