{"id":43974,"title":"Cost-effectiveness of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for mild acute gallstone pancreatitis.","abstract":"A recent Cochrane review suggested that laparoscopic cholecystectomy carried out early following mild gallstone pancreatitis was safe. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 3 days of admission, during the same admission but after more than 3 days, or electively in a subsequent admission.A model-based cost-utility analysis was performed estimating mean costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient in the UK National Health Service with a 1-year time horizon. A decision tree model was constructed and populated with probabilities, outcomes and cost data from published sources for mild gallstone pancreatitis, including one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.The costs of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 3 days of admission, beyond 3 days but in the same admission, and electively in a subsequent admission were € 2748, € 3543 and € 3752 respectively; the QALYs were 0.888, 0.888 and 0.884 respectively. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy had a 91 per cent probability of being cost-effective at the maximum willingness to pay for a QALY commonly used in the UK. It is acknowledged that many hospitals do not have access to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, especially at weekends, and that implementing a 3-day target is unrealistic without allocating new resources that could erode the cost-effectiveness.Performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for mild gallstone pancreatitis within 3 days of admission is cost-effective, but may not be feasible without significant resource allocation. After 3 days there is little financial advantage to same-admission operation.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756933","annotations":[{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.525618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.280861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.244954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.187046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.149145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Gallstone","weight":0.144978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallstone"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_retrograde_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.0945851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_cholangiopancreatography"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Decision tree","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree"},{"name":"Decision tree model","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_model"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"},{"name":"884","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/884"},{"name":"Horizon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"888","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/888"},{"name":"Resource allocation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation"},{"name":"Time horizon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_horizon"},{"name":"Estimation theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Tree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"},{"name":"Retrograde motion","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"},{"name":"Tree model","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_model"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Willingness to pay","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingness_to_pay"},{"name":"Quality-adjusted life year","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year"}]}
