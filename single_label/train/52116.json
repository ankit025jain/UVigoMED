{"id":52116,"title":"Predisposing factors associated with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes among adults in a diabetic clinic, Enugu State, Nigeria.","abstract":"The role of micronutrients and other predisposing factors associated with the aetiology of type 2 diabetes in Nigeria is not well established. The objectives of this study were to investigate predisposing factors associated with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes among a Nigerian adult population.Predisposing factors associated with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes were investigated in 60 Igbo (a major tribe in Eastern Nigeria) adults aged 30-90 years. This study was carried out at the Diabetic Clinic, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Ituku-Ozalla, Enugu. Packed cell volume (PCV), serum ferrtin and some anthropometric parameters were measured alongside fasting blood sugar (FBS).PCV recorded a statistically significant lower (p<0.001) mean value at 32.94±0.61% in the patients when compared with the control group with a mean value of 39.06±1.02%. Serum ferritin revealed a statistically significant higher (p<0.01; 110.20±15.17 ng/ml) mean value in the patients when compared with the control group (20.4±5.64 ng/ml). However, PCV (32.00±0.88%) and body mass index (BMI) (31.99±1.12 Kg/m(2)) recorded a statistically significant lower (p<0.05) mean value in female patients when compared with their corresponding males. There was no significant correlation (p>0.05) between serum iron ferritin, FBS and all other anthropometric predictors of incidence of type 2 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes is not associated with elevated levels of serum iron ferritin. Hence, serum ferritin may not be a better predictor of type 2 diabetes, especially in uncomplicated cases.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627425","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.914436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.78318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.778165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.762134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Ferritin","weight":0.760569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferritin"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.741014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.704061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.645267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Micronutrient","weight":0.519817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.412888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.338059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.235191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0383351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Igbo people","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people"},{"name":"Anthropometry","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry"},{"name":"Serum iron","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_iron"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Bus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus"},{"name":"Eastern Orthodox Church","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Tribe","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
