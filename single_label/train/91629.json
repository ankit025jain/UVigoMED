{"id":91629,"title":"Intra-articular fractures of the distal radius: bridging external fixation in slight flexion and ulnar deviation along articular surface instead of radial shaft.","abstract":"Forty-one patients with intra-articular fracture of the distal radius (AO Type C) were treated with a double joint-bridging external fixator placed radial side of the fracture site and the wrist placed in slight flexion and ulnar deviation equal to the palmar tilt and radial inclination of the uninjured wrist. The patients were evaluated according to the system of Gartland and Werley an average of 43 months (range, 34 to 53 mo) after surgery. There were 14 excellent, 18 good, 7 fair, and 2 poor results. The average flexion was 94% of the normal side, extension 91%, pronation 95%, and supination 84%. The average radial inclination was 22 ± 10 degrees, palmar tilt 8 ± 14 degrees, and maximum articular step or gap was 2 mm. Bridging external fixation with slight wrist flexion and ulnar deviation equal to preinjured palmar tilt and radial inclination provides acceptable clinical and radiologic results.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24487283","annotations":[{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.75024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.74978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Pronation","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronation"},{"name":"Supination","weight":0.715278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supination"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.712922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.666705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.655992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.547422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.222769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.0478254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Ulnar deviation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_deviation"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Axle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"14th parallel south","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_parallel_south"},{"name":"Inclination","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclination"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
