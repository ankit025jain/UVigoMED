{"id":77420,"title":"[News on occupational contact dermatitis].","abstract":"Contact dermatitis--irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis and protein contact dermatitis--are the most common occupational skin diseases, most often localized to the hands. Contact urticaria is rarer The main occupational irritants are wet work, detergents and disinfectants, cutting oils, and solvents. The main occupational allergens are rubber additives, metals (chromium, nickel, cobalt), plastics (epoxy resins, acrylic), biocides and plants. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, medical history and allergy testing. For a number of irritating or sensitizing agents, irritant or allergic dermatitis can be notified as occupational diseases. The two main prevention measures are reducing skin contact with irritants and complete avoidance of skin contact with offending allergens.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851370","annotations":[{"name":"Contact dermatitis","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Chromium","weight":0.855339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.849614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Cobalt","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt"},{"name":"Nickel","weight":0.831245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Natural rubber","weight":0.810373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Resin","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.760987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Detergent","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detergent"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Epoxy","weight":0.597995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.521886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.502345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.414693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biocide","weight":0.395515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocide"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.314279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.275612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Allergic contact dermatitis","weight":0.0937607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_contact_dermatitis"},{"name":"Cutting fluid","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_fluid"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0476996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Skin allergy test","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"}]}
