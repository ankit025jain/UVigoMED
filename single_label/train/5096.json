{"id":5096,"title":"[Manipulative reduction and external fixation with cardboard splint for the treatment of calcaneal fractures: a 60-case report].","abstract":"To investigate the therapeutic effects of manipulative reduction for calcaneal fractures.From January 2009 to June 2012, 53 cases (60 affected feet) of Sanders type I-IV calcaneal fractures were treated by manipulative reduction and external fixation with cardboard splint,including 45 males and 8 females with an average age of (33.5 +/- 1.54) years old ranging from 18 to 65. The course of disease ranged 0.5 h to 7 d. Before treatment the feet were swelling, ache and activity limitation in evidence, some feet were wide flat deformity, the cortical bone was broken in the imaging examination. All selected cases were evaluated using Creighton-Nebraska health foundation assessment scale for fractures of calcaneus.All cases were followed up at 12 months after treatment, 13 feet got excellent curative effect, 34 good, 11 moderate and 2 poor.Manipulative reduction for Sanders type I-IV calcaneal fractures could get excellent curative effect. Manipulative reduction for calcaneal fractures could avoid surgical trauma while assure high curative effects. Manipulative reduction is not only economical and easy therapy, but also can restore maximum function of the calcaneus with few complications and facilitate early rehabilitation of ankle and joint function.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25338438","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.754367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.712922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ankle","weight":0.674364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.660403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.629062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.562768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.516328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.509668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.430164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"External fixation","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_fixation"},{"name":"Cortical bone","weight":0.282443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Calcaneus","weight":0.194746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneus"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.120374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Foot (unit)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
