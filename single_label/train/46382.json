{"id":46382,"title":"Comparison of hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis patients undergoing hepatic resection between hepatitis B and C infection.","abstract":"Type B and C hepatic cirrhosis are main causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In resected cases of HCC, residual liver function of type B cirrhotic patients tend to be better compared to type C cirrhotic patients. We compared clinical data of patients with type B hepatic cirrhosis with type C hepatic cirrhosis who underwent hepatic resection for HCC.Subjects were 16 patients with type B hepatic cirrhosis and 20 patients with type C hepatic cirrhosis who underwent hepatic resection for HCC at Jikei University Hospital. Perioperative findings including age, gender, preoperative laboratory data including ICGR15, Child's classification, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, tumor factor, type of resection, duration of operation, blood loss and incidence of post-operative complications, as well as disease-free and overall survival were analyzed.In type B cirrhotic patients, the age was younger (p<0.001), pre-operative ICGR15 (p=0.004), hemoglobin (p=0.032), albumin (p=0.006), Child's classification (p=0.008), and MELD score (p=0.011) were better, and incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications were fewer (p=0.039) than type C cirrhotic patients. Preoperative ICG, in 11 of 16 type B cirrhotic patients were normal (<10%).Residual liver function of type B cirrhotic patients were better than type C cirrhotic patients.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634946","annotations":[{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.86005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver disease","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.637436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.475271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease","weight":0.385456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_End-Stage_Liver_Disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.34614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Blood type","weight":0.344121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Boston University","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University"},{"name":"Residue (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
