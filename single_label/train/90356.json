{"id":90356,"title":"Improved microcirculation imaging of human skin in vivo using optical microangiography with a correlation mapping mask.","abstract":"Optical microangiography based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) is prone to noise that arises from a static tissue region. Here, we propose a method that can significantly reduce this noise. The method is developed based on an approach that uses the magnitude information of OCT signals to produce tissue microangiograms, especially suitable for the case where a swept-source OCT system is deployed. By combined use of two existing OCT microangiography methods-ultrahigh-sensitive optical microangiography (UHS-OMAG) and correlation mapping OCT (cmOCT)-the final tissue microangiogram is generated by masking UHS-OMAG image using the binary representation of cmOCT image. We find that this process masks the residual static artifacts while preserving the vessel structures. The noise rejection capability of the masked approach (termed as mOMAG) is tested on a tissue-like flow phantom as well as an in vivo human skin tissue. Compared to UHS-OMAG and cmOCT, we demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of achieving improved signal-to-noise ratio in providing microcirculation images. Finally, we show its clinical potential by quantitatively assessing the vascular difference between a burn scar and a normal skin of human subject in vivo.","date":"2014-03-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623159","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.776465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.614344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.596128,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.523852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.485106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.477256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.457103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.26081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.157573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Binary numeral system","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system"},{"name":"Human skin","weight":0.124839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Scar","weight":0.0713771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Apparent magnitude","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"},{"name":"Ghost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost"},{"name":"Stoichiometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry"},{"name":"White noise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"Human subject research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_subject_research"},{"name":"Noise reduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Artifact (archaeology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics"},{"name":"Knowledge representation and reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.0113497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"}]}
