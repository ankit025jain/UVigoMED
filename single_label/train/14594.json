{"id":14594,"title":"L-carnitine attenuates the development of kidney fibrosis in hypertensive rats by upregulating PPAR-?.","abstract":"The development of renal fibrosis is a consequence of arterial hypertension. L-carnitine plays an essential role in the ?-oxidation of fatty acids, and we have previously demonstrated hypotensive, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of L-carnitine in arterial hypertension. This work aims to analyze the effect of L-carnitine on renal fibrosis and to explore the participation of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-? in this effect.Four groups or rats were used: control, treated with L-carnitine, treated with L-NAME, and treated with L-carnitine + L-NAME. Cultured rat kidney cells were also used to examine the role of PPAR-? in L-carnitine effect.An increase in the expression of collagen, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-?1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), Nox2, and Nox4 was found in the kidney of L-NAME-treated rats. Hypertensive rats presented with an expansion of renal fibrotic areas, which was also accompanied by overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1?, and IL-6. A reduction in the expression of PPAR-? and in that of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was found in the kidney of these rats. Simultaneous treatment with L-carnitine attenuated the renal fibrosis (which correlated with a reduction of plasma TGF-?1 levels) and the pro-oxidative and proinflammatory status reported in L-NAME groups, with a concomitant increase in the expression of PPAR-?. Furthermore, the antifibrotic effect of L-carnitine could be blocked by PPAR-? inhibition.This study confirms the efficacy of L-carnitine against hypertension-associated renal fibrosis from in vivo and in vitro studies and suggests that the L-carnitine effect occurs in a PPAR-?-dependent manner.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413708","annotations":[{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.903277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"TGF beta 1","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGF_beta_1"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor beta","weight":0.807084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor_beta"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Hypotension","weight":0.800655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension"},{"name":"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.770731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.614089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.547229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.518514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.398346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.3527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.133377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Beta particle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_particle"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
