{"id":80798,"title":"Isothiocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid derivatives: synthesis, anticancer and antitrypanosomal activity evaluation.","abstract":"A series of new isothiocoumarin-3-carboxylic acids derivatives had been obtained based on the 5-arylidenerhodanines hydrolysis. Anticancer activity screening allowed identification of 7,8-dimethoxy-1-oxo-1H-isothiochromene-3-carboxylic acid (4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)-amide (30) with the highest level of antimitotic activity (GI50NCI-H322M/NSC Lung Cancer = 1.28 ?M). Evaluation of the antitrypanosomal activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei showed that investigated compounds did not exhibit significant antiparasitic effects. Additionally, the most pharmacologically attractive compounds were non-toxic and well tolerated by the experimental animals.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530491","annotations":[{"name":"Carboxylic acid","weight":0.812099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Hydrolysis","weight":0.773116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.745267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.691491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.688959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.557433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.459181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.435712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.320616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Ketone","weight":0.134943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone"},{"name":"Antiparasitic","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparasitic"},{"name":"Derivative (chemistry)","weight":0.0398575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Trypanosoma brucei","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_brucei"},{"name":"Methoxy","weight":0.0209501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxy"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Trypanosoma","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma"},{"name":"Belgian Pro League","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Pro_League"}]}
