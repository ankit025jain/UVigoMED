{"id":56536,"title":"Modulatory effect of different riboflavin compositions on the central corneal thickness of African keratoconus corneas during collagen crosslinking.","abstract":"A pilot investigation to transfer the established corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) procedure in European eyes into clinically affected African eyes and to optimize the treatment by adapting the riboflavin composition.CXL was performed in 15 eyes (11 patients) with advanced stages of keratoconus in the Eye Clinic of Bafoussam in the West Region of Cameroon. The following six riboflavin compositions with different portions of active swelling additives were applied: Solution 1 (0.5% methylhydroxypropylcellulose [MHPC]), solution 2 (1.0% MHPC), solution 3 (1.7% MHPC), solution 4 (5% dextran), solution 5 (10% dextran) and solution 6 (no active swelling ingredient). The central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured by ultrasound pachymetry before and after de-epithelialization and at least every 10 min during CXL.THE APPLICATION OF THE RIBOFLAVIN SOLUTIONS RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING MEAN FINAL CCT VALUES: 172 ± 15% using solution 1 (60 min/n = 5); 183 ± 8% using solution 2 (60 min/n = 5); 170% using solution 3 (60 min/n = 1); 80% using solution 4 (45 min/n = 1); 99% using solution 5 (45 min/n = 1) and 150 ± 13% using solution 6 (50 min/n = 2).The combination of riboflavin compositions with swelling and stabilizing effects on the corneal stroma seems necessary in African eyes with advanced keratoconus. Further studies are required to confirm these primary results.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669149","annotations":[{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.761432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.694254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.277325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Stroma of cornea","weight":0.123432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroma_of_cornea"},{"name":"Keratoconus","weight":0.11859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.0599054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Cameroon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon"},{"name":"Dextran","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextran"},{"name":"Bafoussam","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafoussam"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.0227032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Musical composition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Modulation (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation_(music)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Final (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_(band)"},{"name":"Ingredient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingredient"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Indiana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Junior_Football_Association,_West_Region"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Corneal pachymetry","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneal_pachymetry"}]}
