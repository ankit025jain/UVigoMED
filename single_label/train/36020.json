{"id":36020,"title":"Mutations in Danish patients with long QT syndrome and the identification of a large founder family with p.F29L in KCNH2.","abstract":"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac ion channelopathy which presents clinically with palpitations, syncope or sudden death. More than 700 LQTS-causing mutations have been identified in 13 genes, all of which encode proteins involved in the execution of the cardiac action potential. The most frequently affected genes, covering > 90% of cases, are KCNQ1, KCNH2 and SCN5A.We describe 64 different mutations in 70 unrelated Danish families using a routine five-gene screen, comprising KCNQ1, KCNH2 and SCN5A as well as KCNE1 and KCNE2.Twenty-two mutations were found in KCNQ1, 28 in KCNH2, 9 in SCN5A, 3 in KCNE1 and 2 in KCNE2. Twenty-six of these have only been described in the Danish population and 18 are novel. One double heterozygote (1.4% of families) was found. A founder mutation, p.F29L in KCNH2, was identified in 5 \"unrelated\" families. Disease association, in 31.2% of cases, was based on the type of mutation identified (nonsense, insertion/deletion, frameshift or splice-site). Functional data was available for 22.7% of the missense mutations. None of the mutations were found in 364 Danish alleles and only three, all functionally characterised, were recorded in the Exome Variation Server, albeit at a frequency of < 1:1000.The genetic etiology of LQTS in Denmark is similar to that found in other populations. A large founder family with p.F29L in KCNH2 was identified. In 48.4% of the mutations disease causation was based on mutation type or functional analysis.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606995","annotations":[{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Long QT syndrome","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Missense mutation","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mutation"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.697668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.676751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Syncope (medicine)","weight":0.66437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)"},{"name":"Palpitation","weight":0.594412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpitation"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.45078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"KvLQT1","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KvLQT1"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Heterozygote","weight":0.308238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygote"},{"name":"Voltage-gated potassium channel","weight":0.297756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_potassium_channel"},{"name":"Nav1.5","weight":0.290579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nav1.5"},{"name":"HERG","weight":0.280556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HERG"},{"name":"Cardiac action potential","weight":0.160458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_action_potential"},{"name":"KCNE1","weight":0.141042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCNE1"},{"name":"Channelopathy","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channelopathy"},{"name":"Frameshift mutation","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frameshift_mutation"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.0530188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"KCNE2","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCNE2"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Nonsense mutation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_mutation"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Genetic diversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"}]}
