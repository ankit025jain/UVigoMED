{"id":54816,"title":"[Analysis on the relationship between adolescent myopia and serum sex hormone].","abstract":"To investigate the quantitative changes of the serum sex hormone levels in juvenile myopia patients.In January 2013, investigation of Wenzhou middle school 822 adolescents, including 432 male patients and 390 female patients were involved in the study Visual acuity ? 5 was set as the normal value. The subjects were divided into two groups, the myopia group and the non-myopia group. Chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer was used to detect the subjects' sex hormone concentration of estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).The follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone of the female patients were significantly higher than those of male counterparts (P < 0.01); among the two groups consisting female myopia and non-myopia patients, a significant difference in luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone was shown (P < 0.05); the distinct differences in the level of luteinizing hormone and testosterone level showed in the male myopia group and non-myopia group were of outstanding statistics significance (P < 0.01), showing the result that the level of sex hormone in myopia group was higher than that in the non-myopia group.A close relationship perhaps between the level of sex hormone with gender differences and juvenile myopia is confirmed.","date":"2014-08-21","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25142847","annotations":[{"name":"Follicle-stimulating hormone","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone"},{"name":"Luteinizing hormone","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Estradiol","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Sex steroid","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_steroid"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.751956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.738571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.714882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.643318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Ovarian follicle","weight":0.600328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_follicle"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.112372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"Chemiluminescence","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence"},{"name":"Wenzhou","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenzhou"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"822","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/822"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyser"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Estonian language","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_language"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"}]}
