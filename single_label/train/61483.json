{"id":61483,"title":"Characterization of tissue findings in bone marrow biopsy specimens with small monoclonal B-cell populations.","abstract":"Bone marrows (BMs) with incidentally identified, small monotypic B-cell populations (MBPs) were evaluated.BM aspirates with MBPs representing 5% or less of total events by flow cytometry, less than 5.0 Ã— 10(9)/L B cells in blood, and no history of lymphoma or MBP with a different phenotype from prior lymphoma were selected. Clinical, immunophenotypic, and histologic findings were evaluated.Forty-one of 3,052 BMs had MBPs at 5% or less of total events (median, 1%); 17 were females and 24 were males aged 30 to 87 years (median, 73 years). The MBPs were CD5- in 24, CD5+ resembling chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in 13, and CD5+ unlike CLL in four. Eighteen of 40 had lymphoid aggregates (LAs) with mostly T cells or a mixture of B and T cells, but three cases had B-cell-rich LAs.Unlike monoclonal B lymphocytosis in blood, MBPs in BMs were more commonly CD5-. Forty-five percent of BMs had LAs; none were interpreted as lymphoma, although three were suspicious for B-cell lymphoma.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713740","annotations":[{"name":"Lymphocytosis","weight":0.907927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytosis"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.821293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Bone marrow examination","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_examination"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.728404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"B cell","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.704098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Lymphoid","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid"},{"name":"Needle aspiration biopsy","weight":0.655245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_aspiration_biopsy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.504215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Monoclonal","weight":0.413398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal"},{"name":"Monotypic taxon","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic_taxon"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"CD5 (protein)","weight":0.0213574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD5_(protein)"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"}]}
