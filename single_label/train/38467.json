{"id":38467,"title":"Coronary sinus to left atrium communication.","abstract":"Coronary sinus anomalies are rare. They can be associated with other vascular anomalies such as persistent left superior vena cava or can occur in isolation. We present a rare case of an isolated coronary sinus communication to the left atrium. This anomaly may be clinically relevant in the setting of significant left-to-right shunting or when shunt reversal results from right-sided heart failure. It may also be significant in cases of persistent atrial fibrillation after attempted pulmonary vein isolation.
