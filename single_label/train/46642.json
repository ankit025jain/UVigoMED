{"id":46642,"title":"Retrospective analysis of risk factors affecting pacreatic fistula formation after the closure of the pancreatic stump with sutures in distal pancreatectomy.","abstract":"Development of pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy is still a major problem. Various methods have been defined to prevent the development of the fistula. In this study, the results of suture closure of pancreatic duct and closure of pancreatic stump with “U” sutures passing through each other and the risk factors affecting the development of fistula are studied.Fifty-one patients with prospectively collected data were included in the study. In all patients, pancreatic stump was closed with the same surgical technique. Risk factors that may affect fistula formation were studied between groups with and without fistula. Pancreatic fistula definition was made according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistulas classification.Eight (15.7%) of the 51 patients had fistula. Clinically significant fistula ratio was 9.8% (according to ISGPF B and C). Additional organ resections were performed in 18 patients (35.3%). In multivariate analysis, the soft texture of pancreatic parenchyma (OR: 12.420, p = 0.048) and over 150 mL of blood loss (OR: 1.003, p = 0.043) were found as risk factors for the development of fistula.Closure of pancreatic stump after distal pancreatectomy with “U” shaped sutures passing through each other is a method that can be performed safely.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624452","annotations":[{"name":"Blood","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.734955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.665194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Pancreatectomy","weight":0.661631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatectomy"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.619298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Pancreatic duct","weight":0.47348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.340035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.160781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Pancreatic fistula","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_fistula"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.0230596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Study Group International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_Group_International"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
