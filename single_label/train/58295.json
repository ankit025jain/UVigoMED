{"id":58295,"title":"Role of oral misoprostol for treatment of incomplete abortion.","abstract":"To study the role of oral misoprostol in the management of Incomplete abortion, 98 women with a clinical diagnosis of incomplete abortion and the uterine size < 12 weeks were recruited for this study. A single dose of 600 microg of oral misoprostol was given to these patients. If abortion was clinically complete at follow-up after 3 days, the woman was released from the study. If it was still incomplete, immediate suction and evacuation was performed. Percentage of successful abortion (success defined as no secondary surgical intervention needed) and adverse effects were observed. Success was achieved in 96 (97.96%) out of 98 cases. In 32.6% cases adverse effects were found. Misoprostol used orally in the management of incomplete abortion, forms an alternative treatment modality, particularly in resource poor set up. It is highly effective with little adverse effects.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968499","annotations":[{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.662005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.649749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.406296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Misoprostol","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.31207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Incomplete (Backstreet Boys song)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_(Backstreet_Boys_song)"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Vacuum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"},{"name":"Suction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
