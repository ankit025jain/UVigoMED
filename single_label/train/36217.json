{"id":36217,"title":"The scaphocephalic skull of an adult male.","abstract":"The paper presents abnormal craniofacial morphology of an adult male afflicted with premature closure of the sagittal suture. The skull is well preserved and there are no visible traits of surgical management which would be aimed to correctcranial deformation. In consequence of the restricted cranial development, some diameters of the skull were significantly altered. Basically, cranial vault morphology fits apparently to the scaphocephaly, whereas the basic ranium and viscerocranium are altered only in minor degree.
