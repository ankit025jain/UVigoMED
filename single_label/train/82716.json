{"id":82716,"title":"A randomized controlled trial of a 10 percent CPP-ACP cream to reduce mutans streptococci colonization.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a 10 percent casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) cream to reduce mutans streptococci (MS) colonization and prevent early childhood caries.The cohort was randomized at mean age of 11 days old to receive once-daily CPP-ACP cream (n=102) or no product (comparison group; n=89) from the time of first tooth eruption. All mothers were contacted by telephone at six, 12, and 18 months and advised to brush their children's teeth twice daily with low-dose fluoride toothpaste. At 24 months, all children were examined at a community clinic.At 24 months old, one out of 65 (2 percent) children in the CPP-ACP group had caries vs. four out of 58 (seven percent) in the comparison group (difference not statistically significant). There were fewer MS-positive children in the CPP-ACP group (26 percent) vs. the comparison group (47 percent; P=.02). A dose-response effect of CPP-ACP usage on MS was observed, where MS was present in eight percent of regular CPP-ACP users, 28 percent of irregular users, and 47 percent of non-users (P<.02).CPP-ACP reduced the percentages of mutans streptococci-positive 24-month-old children, although it did not reduce caries prevalence.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553281","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.752514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Toothpaste","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.710022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Calcium phosphate","weight":0.694133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_phosphate"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Casein","weight":0.590867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein"},{"name":"Streptococcus mutans","weight":0.547537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.525612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.518773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.514821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tooth eruption","weight":0.454457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_eruption"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.130565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Deciduous teeth","weight":0.0727855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Cream","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Multiple sclerosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Brush","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Colonialism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"}]}
