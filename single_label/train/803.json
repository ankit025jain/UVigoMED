{"id":803,"title":"Effectiveness of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in adults aged 60 years and over in the Region of Madrid, Spain, 2008-2011.","abstract":"Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is a notifiable disease in the Region of Madrid. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) is recommended for children and adults aged two years or over with a high risk of disease, and for all adults aged 60 and over. We describe the evolution of IPD incidence from 2008 to 2011 in people aged 60 years and over and PPV23 vaccine effectiveness (VE). VE is estimated using both the screening method and indirect cohort method. The incidence of IPD varied from 20.0 in 2008 to 15.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011 (RR: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6–0.9). Adjusted VE estimated with the screening method was 68.2% (95% CI: 56.2–76.9). VE with the Broome method was 44.5% (95% CI: 23.8–59.6) for all PPV23 serotypes, and 64.4% (95% CI: 45.2–76.8) for PPV23 serotypes not included in conjugate vaccines. VE was lower in patients aged 80 years and older (25.5%; 95% CI:-23.2 to 55.0) and those with highrisk medical conditions (31.7%; 95% CI: -2.2 to -54.4). Adjusted VE was 44.5% (95% CI: 19.4-61.8) within 5 years of vaccination and 32.5% (95% CI: -5.6 to 56.9) after 5 years. These results are compatible with current recommendations for PPV23.","date":"2014-10-17","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25323079","annotations":[{"name":"Polysaccharide","weight":0.836937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.797654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine","weight":0.722247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_polysaccharide_vaccine"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.697468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","weight":0.497227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_conjugate_vaccine"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.441888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Notifiable disease","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notifiable_disease"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Madrid","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Venezuela","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"859","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/859"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"Pay-per-view","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Valence (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Community of Madrid","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_Madrid"},{"name":"Broome, Western Australia","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broome,_Western_Australia"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"},{"name":"Effectiveness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness"},{"name":"Breast cancer screening","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer_screening"}]}
