{"id":53365,"title":"Serum androgen bioactivity is low in children with premature adrenarche.","abstract":"Clinical findings in children with premature adrenarche (PA) correlate only partly with circulating levels of adrenal androgens. It is not known whether the prepubertal low circulating concentrations of testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone, together with those of adrenal androgens, are capable of activating the androgen receptor.This cross-sectional study was performed at a university hospital. Circulating androgen bioactivity was measured in 67 prepubertal children with clinical signs of PA and 94 control children using a novel androgen bioassay.Circulating androgen bioactivity was low in the PA and control children. In the subgroup of children (n = 28) with serum T concentration over the assay sensitivity (0.35 nmol/l) and a signal in the androgen bioassay, we found a positive correlation between androgen bioactivity and serum T (r = 0.50; P < 0.01) and the free androgen index (r = 0.61; P < 0.01) and a negative correlation with serum sex hormone-binding globulin concentration (r = -0.41; P < 0.05).Peripheral metabolism of adrenal androgen precursors may be required for any androgenic effects in PA. However, the limitations in the sensitivity of the bioassay developed herein may hide some differences between the PA and control children.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24522103","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.848747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Dihydrotestosterone","weight":0.832147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Adrenal gland","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"},{"name":"Puberty","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.712346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.533579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.518093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.441689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.341507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.276722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.240868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Biological activity","weight":0.135743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity"},{"name":"Globulin","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globulin"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.128778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Adrenarche","weight":0.0364124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenarche"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Bioassay","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Signalling theory","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"}]}
