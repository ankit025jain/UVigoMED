{"id":90621,"title":"Refractures following removal of plates and elastic nails from paediatric forearms.","abstract":"We assessed the risk for refractures following removal of elastic nails and plates from paediatric forearms. Out of 82 children who had 112 plates removed, seven patients (8.5%) had refractures when removals were within 12 months of implantation. Those aged 12 years or older were at risk. Out of 24 patients who had 38 nails removed, four patients (16.7%) had refractures and the risk was high when nails were removed within 6 months of insertion. Children aged 9 years or older were at risk. We do not recommend removal of forearm plates within 12 months and nails within 6 months of implantation.
