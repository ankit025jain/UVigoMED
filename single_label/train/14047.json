{"id":14047,"title":"Deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase attenuates cardiac hypertrophy via down-regulation of cardiac fibroblasts-derived fibroblast growth factor-2.","abstract":"Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (Ephx2) has been shown to play a protective role in cardiac hypertrophy, but the mechanism is not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase attenuates cardiac hypertrophy via down-regulation of cardiac fibroblasts-derived fibroblast growth factor-2.Prospective, controlled, and randomized animal study.University laboratory.Male wild-type C57BL/6 mice and Ephx2 (-/-) mice.Male wild-type or Ephx2 (-/-) mice were subjected to transverse aorta constriction surgery.Four weeks after transverse aorta constriction, Ephx2 (-/-) mice did not develop significant cardiac hypertrophy as that of wild-type mice, indicated by no changes in the ratio of heart weight/body weight and ventricular wall thickness after transverse aorta constriction. Cardiac fibroblast growth factor-2 increased in wild-type-transverse aorta constriction group but this did not change in Ephx2 (-/-)-transverse aorta constriction group, and the serum level of fibroblast growth factor-2 did not change in both groups. In vitro, cardiac fibroblasts were stimulated by angiotensin II to analyze the expression of fibroblast growth factor-2. The effect of increased fibroblast growth factor-2 from cardiac fibroblasts induced by angiotensin II was attenuated by soluble epoxide hydrolase deletion. ERK1/2, p38, and AKT kinase were involved in fibroblast growth factor-2 expression regulated by angiotensin II, and soluble epoxide hydrolase deletion lowered the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 not p38 or AKT to mediate fibroblast growth factor-2 expression. In addition, soluble epoxide hydrolase deletion did not attenuate cardiomyocytes hypertrophy induced by exogenous fibroblast growth factor-2.Our present data demonstrated that deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase prevented cardiac hypertrophy not only directly to cardiomyocytes but also to cardiac fibroblasts by reducing expression of fibroblast growth factor-2.","date":"2014-04-16","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448199","annotations":[{"name":"Fibroblast","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.75702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.734939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.699177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Hypertrophy","weight":0.696492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Fibroblast growth factor","weight":0.661005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.654825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hydrolase","weight":0.654224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolase"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.592811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.59018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Angiotensin II","weight":0.57763,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.575206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.386088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.335701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Vasoconstriction","weight":0.327246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.252692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Nuclear receptor","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.125489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.0300445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases","weight":0.0248623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P38_mitogen-activated_protein_kinases"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
