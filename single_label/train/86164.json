{"id":86164,"title":"Comparing the Asthma APGAR system and the Asthma Control Test™ in a multicenter primary care sample.","abstract":"To compare asthma control assessment using the Asthma APGAR system, a tool developed by primary care clinicians, in a multicenter primary care sample with the Asthma Control Test (ACT™)/Childhood Asthma Control Test (CACT™), a tool developed by asthma specialists.This is a substudy of a multicenter, randomized, controlled pragmatic trial that tests the effectiveness of the Asthma APGAR system in primary care practices. As part of the study, enrolled patients completed both the ACT™/CACT™ and the Asthma APGAR system between March 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. Kappa and McNemar statistics were used to compare the results of questionnaires.Of the 468 patients in our sample, 306 (65%) were classified as not controlled by the ACT™/CACT™ or the Asthma APGAR system. The overall agreement was 84.4%, with a kappa value of .68 (substantial agreement) and a McNemar test P value of .35 (suggesting no significant difference in the direction of disagreement). Of those with poor control as defined by the Asthma APGAR system, 23.8% (73) had no controller medications and 76.5% (234) were seldom or sometimes able to avoid identified triggers for their asthma. Of those who stated that they had been prescribed controller medications, 116 of 332 (35%) stated that they did not use the controller medication on a daily basis.The Asthma APGAR system and the ACT™/CACT™ similarly assess asthma control in a multicenter primary care-based sample. The Asthma APGAR system identified an \"actionable item\" in more than 75% (234) of the individuals with poor asthma control, thus linking an assessment of poor asthma control with a management strategy.","date":"2014-07-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809759","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.620071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.233635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.215183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.147371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.0678564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Pragmatism","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"McNemar's test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNemar's_test"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"December 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_31"},{"name":"March 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"234","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/234"},{"name":"306","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/306"},{"name":"Comptroller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller"},{"name":"Database trigger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_trigger"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Kappa (folklore)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_(folklore)"},{"name":"Classified information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0141339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"}]}
