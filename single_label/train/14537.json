{"id":14537,"title":"Influence of bacteriophage P22 on the inflammatory mediator gene expression in chicken macrophage HD11 cells infected with Salmonella Typhimurium.","abstract":"This study was designed to evaluate the effects of bacteriophage on the intracellular survival and immune mediator gene expression in chicken macrophage-like HD11 cells. The invasive ability and intracellular survival of Salmonella Typhimurium (ST(P22-) ) and lysogenic S. Typhimurium (ST(P22+) ) in HD11 cells were evaluated at 37 Â°C for 24 h postinfection (hpi). The expression of inflammatory mediator genes was determined in ST(P22-) - and ST(P22+) -infected HD11 cells treated with and without bacteriophage P22 at 1 and 24 hpi using quantitative RT-PCR. The ability of ST(P22-) and ST(P22+) to invade HD11 cells was significantly decreased by bacteriophage P22 at 1 hpi. The numbers of intracellular ST(P22-) and ST(P22+) were significantly decreased from 2.39 to 1.62 CFU cm(-2) and from 3.40 to 1.72 CFU cm(-2) in HD11 cells treated with bacteriophage P22, respectively, at 24 hpi. The enhanced expression of inflammatory mediators was observed in ST(P22-) - and ST(P22+) -infected HD11 cells treated with and without bacteriophage P22. These results suggest that the application of bacteriophage could be an effective way to control the intracellular infection.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24417259","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.883265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Bacteriophage","weight":0.85687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Salmonella","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.712036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.679464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Lysogenic cycle","weight":0.53843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysogenic_cycle"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.477773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Salmonella enterica","weight":0.165579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0677463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Inflammatory mediators","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_mediators"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"P22 type foundry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P22_type_foundry"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Horsepower","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower"},{"name":"Mediation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Caribbean Football Union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Football_Union"}]}
