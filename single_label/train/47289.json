{"id":47289,"title":"Impact of pre-angiogenic factors on the treatment effect of bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) play a major role in tumor growth and metastasis. Our aim was to determine whether there is any association between these endothelial parameters and tumor markers with the clinical outcome of bevacizumab-treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients in terms of response and survival. Pretreatment serum levels of ET-1, ADMA, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 were measured in 36 chemotherapy-naive mCRC patients treated with first-line bevacizumab-based therapy. Additionally, after first cycle of treatment, serum levels of these parameters were reanalyzed. Lower baseline serum ET-1 and ADMA levels were observed in patients responding to bevacizumab-based treatment (respectively, p = 0.037, p = 0.034). Median progression-free survival (PFS) (11 vs. 6 months, p = 0.012) and overall survival (OS) (28 vs 9 months; p = 0.007) were significantly shorter in patients with high pretreatment ET-1 levels. There was a significant decrease in ET-1 and CEA levels after first treatment (p = 0.020, p = 0.012), while ADMA and CA 19-9 levels were not significantly changed. Patients with decreased posttreatment ET-1 levels were shown to have inferior PFS (6 vs 11 months, p = 0.022), but no statistically significant difference was shown with respect to OS (p = 0.141). The effect of bevacizumab on endothelin axis including the biologic basis of decreasing ET-1 levels due to bevacizumab treatment and its association with inferior outcome has to be clarified in prospective trials.","date":"2014-03-05","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596030","annotations":[{"name":"Carcinoembryonic antigen","weight":0.898993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoembryonic_antigen"},{"name":"Bevacizumab","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab"},{"name":"Carbohydrate","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.858148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.752451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.733152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Tumor marker","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_marker"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.700939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.503506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.321256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.194121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.123515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Endothelin","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelin"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.021561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"}]}
