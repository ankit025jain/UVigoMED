{"id":23518,"title":"Respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viral infections in older adults with moderate to severe influenza-like illness.","abstract":"Few studies have prospectively assessed viral etiologies of acute respiratory infections in community-based elderly individuals. We assessed viral respiratory pathogens in individuals ?65 years with influenza-like illness (ILI).Multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction identified viral pathogens in nasal/throat swabs from 556 episodes of moderate-to-severe ILI, defined as ILI with pneumonia, hospitalization, or maximum daily influenza symptom severity score (ISS) >2. Cases were selected from a randomized trial of an adjuvanted vs nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine conducted in elderly adults from 15 countries.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 7.4% (41/556) moderate-to-severe ILI episodes in elderly adults. Most (39/41) were single infections. There was a significant association between country and RSV detection (P = .004). RSV prevalence was 7.1% (2/28) in ILI with pneumonia, 12.5% (8/64) in ILI with hospitalization, and 6.7% (32/480) in ILI with maximum ISS > 2. Any virus was detected in 320/556 (57.6%) ILI episodes: influenza A (104/556, 18.7%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (82/556, 14.7%), coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (each 32/556, 5.6%).This first global study providing data on RSV disease in ?65 year-olds confirms that RSV is an important respiratory pathogen in the elderly. Preventative measures such as vaccination could decrease severe respiratory illnesses and complications in the elderly.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482398","annotations":[{"name":"Human respiratory syncytial virus","weight":0.909087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_respiratory_syncytial_virus"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Influenza vaccine","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Viral disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Influenza A virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Coronavirus","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus"},{"name":"Metapneumovirus","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapneumovirus"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.733831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.713157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.703547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Syncytium","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytium"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Influenza-like illness","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"International Space Station","weight":0.348559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.223263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Cotton swab","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"}]}
