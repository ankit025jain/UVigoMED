{"id":13825,"title":"Differential expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines during experimental infection with low or high virulence bovine viral diarrhea virus in beef calves.","abstract":"The objective was to compare the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-?, IL-1?, IFN-?, IL-2, IL-12, IL-15) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-?) cytokines, after experimental infection with low or high virulence noncytopathic (ncp) bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Thirty BVDV-na√Øve, beef calves were intranasally inoculated with low (LV; n=10, SD-1) or high (HV; n=10, 1373) virulence ncp BVDV or with BVDV-free cell culture medium (Control, n=10). Calves were euthanized on day 5 post-inoculation, and tracheo-bronchial lymph node and spleen samples were collected for mRNA expression through quantitative-RT-PCR. mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory (TNF-?, IL-1?, IL-2, IFN-?) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines were up-regulated in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of HV, but not in LV, compared to the control group (P<0.05). IL-12 mRNA level was up-regulated in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of both LV and HV groups (P ? 0.05). A significant up-regulation of IL-15 mRNA was observed in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes for LV calves (P<0.002), but not for HV calves. Experimental inoculation with BVDV-2 1373 stimulated significant mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, inoculation with BVDV-1a SD-1 only resulted in up-regulation of IL-12 and IL-15 mRNA, which is associated with activation of macrophages and NK cells during innate immune response.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24461321","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Anti-inflammatory","weight":0.857164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory"},{"name":"Interleukin 4","weight":0.838781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_4"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.746127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Innate immune system","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system"},{"name":"Interleukin 12","weight":0.698357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_12"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.585245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Flaviviridae","weight":0.461438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaviviridae"},{"name":"Interleukin 15","weight":0.435389,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_15"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.329404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.272369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.186417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Bovine virus diarrhea","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_virus_diarrhea"},{"name":"Bovinae","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae"}]}
