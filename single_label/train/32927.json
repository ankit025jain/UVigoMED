{"id":32927,"title":"A case report of Charcot arthropathy caused by syringomyelia and Chiari malformation complicated with scoliosis.","abstract":"Although Charcot arthropathy, also known as neuropathic arthropathy, of which early diagnosis and treatment is extremely difficult, associated with other cause factor has been widely described, Charcot arthropathy caused by syringomyelia and Chiari malformation complicated with scoliosis has never been described in the literature.A 44-year-old male was hospitalized for diagnosis and treatment due to complaining the progressively swelling and limitation of motion in his left shoulder joint for 1 year. The patient has no significant past medical history except for scoliosis 8 years prior to his presentation to our clinic; He denied any constitutional symptoms, trauma, or pain in the upper extremities at this time of presentation. Based on history, physical and auxiliary examination, following diagnoses were made: Charcot arthropathy of the left shoulder, syringomyelia, Chiari malformation and scoliosis.Once Charcot arthritis was found, it was mostly in advanced stage and very difficult to treat. So we recommended that if patient suffering from scoliosis visited in clinic, further examination such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and regular follow-up should be carried out, and early-stage of this devastating disease caused by syringomyelia and Chiari malformation may be diagnosed easily.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886292","annotations":[{"name":"Scoliosis","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.766936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Medical history","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.733582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Jean-Martin Charcot","weight":0.381782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Martin_Charcot"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.223833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.210374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.201851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.166855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Swelling (medical)","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Syringomyelia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringomyelia"},{"name":"Chiari malformation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiari_malformation"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"United States Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"},{"name":"Arthropathy","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropathy"}]}
