{"id":88169,"title":"Cricket injuries: an orthopaedist's perspective.","abstract":"A decade ago, cricket has traditionally been regarded as relatively injury free, although it has been classified as having a \"moderate\" injury risk. At present, cricket has evolved into shorter and more competitive versions involving greater aggression and often played for long periods of time. This has expectedly ensued in an increase in the number of cricketing injuries similar to those seen in other sports which involve running, throwing, or being hit by a hard object. However, there are some injuries to look out for especially in cricket players. In this article, we have reviewed information about cricket injuries that will help orthopaedists make the correct diagnoses and initiate appropriate treatment. Orthopaedic surgeons and physiotherapists should work as a team to detect treatable cricket injuries at an early stage and ensure that every precaution is taken to minimize the risks of injury.
