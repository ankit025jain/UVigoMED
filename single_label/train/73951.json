{"id":73951,"title":"Comparison of promoter DNA methylation and expression levels of genes encoding CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins in AML patients.","abstract":"CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (CEBPs) are transcription factors regulating myeloid differentiation. Disturbances of their expression may contribute to leukemogenesis. In this study we compared promoter methylation and expression levels of selected CEBP genes in a group of 78 AML patients, normal bone marrow and hematopoietic precursor cells. CEBPA, CEBPD and CEBPE promoter methylation levels were elevated in 37%, 35.5% and 56.7% of patients. No CEBPZ(DDIT3) methylation was observed. An inverse relationship between CEBPA and CEBPD DNA methylation and expression levels was observed. AML cytogenetic risk groups and patients with particular translocation are characterized by distinct methylation/expression profile of CEBPs encoding genes.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878001","annotations":[{"name":"DNA methylation","weight":0.834549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Promoter (biology)","weight":0.744581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(biology)"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.715166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.690594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.651115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"CEBPA","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEBPA"},{"name":"Precursor (chemistry)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Precursor cell","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precursor_cell"},{"name":"CEBPE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEBPE"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Inverse relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_relationship"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"}]}
