{"id":66302,"title":"Screening and detection advances in magnetic resonance image-guided prostate biopsy.","abstract":"Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has provided a method for visualizing prostate cancer. MRI-ultrasonography fusion allows prostate biopsy to be performed quickly, on an outpatient basis, using the transrectal technique. Targeted biopsies are more sensitive for detection of prostate cancer than nontargeted, systematic biopsies and detect more significant prostate cancers and fewer insignificant cancers than conventional biopsies. A negative MRI scan should not defer biopsy. Two groups who will especially benefit from targeted prostate biopsy are men with low-risk lesions in active surveillance and men with increased prostate-specific antigen levels and previous negative conventional biopsies.
