{"id":32689,"title":"Risk of epilepsy among patients with atopic dermatitis: a nationwide longitudinal study.","abstract":"Both atopic dermatitis and epilepsy have been regarded as chronic inflammatory diseases. However, their association has yet to be investigated.Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 35,312 patients with atopic dermatitis but without a history of epilepsy, and 35,312 age-/gender-matched controls were enrolled between 1998 and 2008, and followed to the end of 2011 to identify the development of epilepsy.Subjects with atopic dermatitis had a higher incidence of developing epilepsy (0.94 vs. 0.27/1,000 person-years, p < 0.001) than the control group. The Cox regression model showed that atopic dermatitis increased the risk of developing epilepsy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.23-3.82) after adjusting for demographic data and medical comorbidities. Sensitivity tests showed consistent findings (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.68-2.96) after excluding the first year of observation. In addition, asthma (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.04-1.72) and allergic rhinitis (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.04-1.73) were related to the risk of epilepsy.Subjects with atopic dermatitis were associated with an increased risk of developing epilepsy in later life. Further studies would be needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","date":"2014-08-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917387","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.846532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.670127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.624547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.604483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.594254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.286252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.264844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Rhinitis","weight":0.204051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.184345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.154465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Allergic rhinitis","weight":0.0519229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"},{"name":"Atopic dermatitis","weight":0.0447457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopic_dermatitis"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Dermatitis","weight":0.0252834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.0144303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Child development","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development"},{"name":"National health insurance","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance"}]}
