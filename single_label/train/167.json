{"id":167,"title":"Rodent consumption in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand.","abstract":"Rodents are important reservoirs of rodent-borne infections worldwide, including Southeast Asia and Northeast Thailand (Isaan), where rodent consumption may be a source of rodent-borne diseases. The behavior of consuming rodents is related to a population's traditions, knowledge, cultural, and household contexts, among other factors. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand during November-December 2011. It aimed to elicit information about rodent consumption among residents of this province, and to identify factors associated with rodent consumption there. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that male gender, large family size, and use of rainwater as the main source of drinking water were positively associated with reported rodent consumption in this province, while having proper knowledge/attitudes towards animal-borne disease was negatively associated. These results provide evidence-base information for further studies, such as participatory ac- tion research, to further explore how people interact with rodents in different contexts. Further research is also needed to characterize risk of zoonotic diseases in relation to rodent consumption.","date":"2014-11-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417525","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Southeast Asia","weight":0.608424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"},{"name":"Asia","weight":0.588224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.438707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.435845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.435489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.42191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.41924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Rodent","weight":0.417222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.379776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.371548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Rain","weight":0.331777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Household","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Grammatical gender","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States_(U.S._Census_Bureau)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Isan","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isan"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.023431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Participation (decision making)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_(decision_making)"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"}]}
