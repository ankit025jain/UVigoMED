{"id":68562,"title":"Treatment of collecting duct carcinoma: current status and future perspectives.","abstract":"Chemotherapy for collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) has demonstrated only limited efficacy in the advanced setting. The present study evaluated the activity of targeted therapies in metastatic CDC.We evaluated a cohort of 384 consecutive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). The characteristics of patients with CDC were compared against those of the remaining cohort. All patients with CDC were treated with targeted therapies.Thirteen patients with advanced CDC were referred to our Center (incidence: 3.4% of all mRCC). Median age was 57 and 62 years in the CDC and non-CDC groups, respectively. The overall disease control in the CDC population was 23%, and median overall survival was 4 (95% confidence interval(CI)=2.4-5.6) months. Three patients obtained a satisfying response (disease control lasting 6-33 months).CDC has a poor prognosis compared to non-CDC renal cell carcinoma. Treatment for CDC represents a future challenge and targeted therapies may play a role in selected cases.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24511050","annotations":[{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.718795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.511916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.459099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Collecting duct system","weight":0.345962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collecting_duct_system"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.344562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.137746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.133765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"633","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/633"},{"name":"384","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/384"},{"name":"Maybach 57 and 62","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybach_57_and_62"},{"name":"Duct (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Population pyramid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid"}]}
