{"id":72449,"title":"Inhibition of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by stereoisomers of 1-methyl tryptophan in an experimental graft-versus-tumor model.","abstract":"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan catabolism that plays an important role in the induction of immune tolerance. Its role in graft-versus-tumor effect after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains unclear. Using a murine graft-versus-tumor model of reduced-intensity allo-HSCT followed by donor leukocyte infusion (DLI), we examined the role of IDO inhibition. Two stereoisomers of 1-methyl tryptophan (1-MT), a small-molecule inhibitor of IDO, reduced the growth of inoculated tumor in the mice that received DLI and had higher expression of IDO1 and IFN?. However, L-1MT, but not D-1MT, mitigated tumor growth in mice that did not receive DLI and did not express IDO1 and IFN?. Accordingly, both stereoisomers reduced plasma kynurenine concentrations early after DLI and enhanced inÂ vitro cytotoxic lymphocyte function after allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Furthermore, L-1MT was more efficient in causing direct cytotoxic effects than D-1MT. Our results suggest that IDO inhibition can benefit anti-tumor therapy in the setting of reduced-intensity allo-SCT using DLI.
