{"id":55930,"title":"Case report: familial primary open-angle glaucoma: a case report.","abstract":"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a disease that is often inherited, but the rules governing its inheritance are inconclusive. Herein, we report a case of POAG in a Chinese family. A 25-year-old female patient was referred to our department with progressive visual acuity decline in her left eye for the past 3 years. Ophthalmological examination supported our diagnosis of POAG in both eyes. We recorded the case history and clinical data of the proband and her family members and followed standard genetic study procedures. In this family, there were 8 individuals (4 male and 4 female) diagnosed with POAG, 2 of whom died. Genetic analysis revealed that the inheritance pattern of POAG in this family is autosomal dominant.
