{"id":8689,"title":"Cross-protective immune responses between genotypically distinct lineages of infectious laryngotracheitis viruses.","abstract":"Recent phylogenetic studies have identified different genotypic lineages of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), and these lineages can recombine in the field. The emergence of virulent recombinant field strains of ILTV by natural recombination between commercial vaccines belonging to different genotypic lineages has been reported recently. Despite the use of attenuated ILTV vaccines, these recombinant viruses were able to spread and cause disease in commercial poultry flocks, raising the question of whether the different lineages of ILTV can induce cross-protective immune responses. This study examined the capacity of the Australian-origin A20 ILTV vaccine to protect against challenge with the class 8 ILTV recombinant virus, the genome of which is predominantly derived from a heterologous genotypic lineage. Following challenge, birds vaccinated via eyedrop were protected from clinical signs of disease and pathological changes in the tracheal mucosa, although they were not completely protected from viral infection or replication. In contrast, the challenge virus induced severe clinical signs and tracheal pathology in unvaccinated birds. This is the first study to examine the ability of a vaccine from the Australian lineage to protect against challenge with a virus from a heterologous lineage. These results suggest that the two distinct genotypic lineages of ILTV can both induce cross-protection, indicating that current commercial vaccines are still likely to assist in control of ILTV in the poultry industry, in spite of the emergence of novel recombinants derived from different genotypic lineages.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758128","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Phylogenetics","weight":0.790758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Genetic recombination","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.734035,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.73316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.688959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.461817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Attenuator (genetics)","weight":0.420466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.413257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Vertebrate trachea","weight":0.411142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.358664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.17695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Gallid herpesvirus 1","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallid_herpesvirus_1"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Kinship","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Heterologous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Recombinant virus","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_virus"}]}
