{"id":77577,"title":"[Disorders caused by the exposure to chemical compounds].","abstract":"The number of the chemical compounds handled in current Japan is approximately 60,000, and approximately 1,500 of new chemicals are registered every year. Approximately 200 chemicals are regulated. The prescribed industrial disease occurs 200-320 cases in a recent year, and the half are caused by unregulated chemicals. In this report, recent cases, especially the chemicals of which uses are increasing or newly introduced, such as hydrofluoric acid and nitrogen-based organic solvent, are described about onset situations, symptoms and the preventive measures required in handling. In addition, national preventive measures against industrial diseases by the exposure to chemical compounds are described.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605518","annotations":[{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.712948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.582012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Hydrofluoric acid","weight":0.558969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.462754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.424104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Organic compound","weight":0.343279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.228276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Occupational disease","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_disease"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"}]}
