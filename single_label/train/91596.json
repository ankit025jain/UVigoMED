{"id":91596,"title":"[The Citizen Accompaniment Project for Community Integration for people with traumatic brain injury: a step towards resilience?].","abstract":"most people with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) live with physical, sensory, or psychological sequelae that affect their day-to-day functioning and prevent them from performing their regular activities.a Citizen Accompaniment for Community Integration project (APIC) was implemented for people with TBI to fulfill the lack of access to resources and gives them support to redefine their life projects.this study's aim is to evaluate the APIC's impacts on the participants' wellbeing and their ability to participate in recreational and day-to-day living activities.it uses a mixed research design of multiple case studies supported by a participative and collaborative research approach. Qualitative and quantitative datas were collected from 9 participants with TBI in 2 stages, at the beginning of the APIC after 6 months and at the end, after 12 months, using semi-structured interviews.this study shows the APIC's positive impacts in the development of the participant's autonomy and satisfaction with their social participation.it tends to reveal that the APIC is a safe space for experimentation, founded on a reciprocal relationship between accompanied and accompanier, and promoting the commitment to the resilience process.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490458","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.661374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.492394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.414628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.400359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Autonomy","weight":0.322103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy"},{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.288707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Collaboration","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Citizenship","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0477168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Design of experiments","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments"},{"name":"Accompaniment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accompaniment"},{"name":"Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller"},{"name":"Safe-space","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space"},{"name":"Sequela","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Internationalism (politics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalism_(politics)"},{"name":"Multiracial","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial"},{"name":"Reciprocity (social psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)"},{"name":"Psychological resilience","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience"},{"name":"Proletariat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat"},{"name":"Pole and polar","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_and_polar"}]}
