{"id":45515,"title":"ESD around the world: United States.","abstract":"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a well-established advanced mucosal resection technique used in Japan, where it originated, and some other Asian countries. The technical difficulty and potentially higher rates of significant complications have been obstacles for its dissemination across the United States, on top of the lack of available equipment, candidate lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, and adequate training programs. Yet American physicians are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of ESD. Simplification of technique, modification of tools and materials, and improved availability of training opportunities are essential in order to accelerate the adoption of ESD in the United States.
