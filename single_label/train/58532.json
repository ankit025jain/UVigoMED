{"id":58532,"title":"[Predictive value of HLA-DRB1 gene for the treatment of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion with paternal lymphocyte alloimmunization therapy in Henan Hans].","abstract":"To explore the value of HLA-DRB1 gene in predicting the outcome of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) treated with paternal lymphocyte alloimmunization therapy (PLAT) in Henan Hans.Three hundred URSA patients were recruited. Following PLAT treatment, they were divided into two groups according to the outcome of pregnancy. Polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) were conducted to analyze the HLA-DRB1 gene.For those who have received PLAT treatment, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*11 was significantly lower in successfully treated cases than those with abortion (0.052 vs. 0.110, P < 0.05, OR=0448), whilst the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 was significantly greater in the former (0.207 vs. 0.100, P < 0.05, OR=2.352).For patients who have received PLAT treatment, those with HLA-DRB1*15 are more likely to conceive that those with HLA-DRB1*11.","date":"2014-06-14","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928025","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.901752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.846632,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.713397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.668095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.656107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Abortion","weight":0.560345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.348285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fertilisation","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation"},{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Henan","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan"},{"name":"Alloimmunity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloimmunity"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Ursa (Finland)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_(Finland)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}]}
