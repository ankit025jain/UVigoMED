{"id":18895,"title":"[The effectiveness of BACTEC MGIT 960 system hit analysis of surgery material of patients with tubercular spondylitis].","abstract":"The article considers the comparison of effectiveness of cultivation of 290 surgery samples from focus of destruction in patients with tubercular spondylitis in liquid medium Middlebrook 7119 with fluorescent detection of growth and two dense egg medium -Levenschtein-Yensen and Finn-II. The sensitivity of methods of inoculation in liquid medium Middlebrook 7H9 and in dense egg mediums has no difference (38.2% and 43.1%, p = 0.271). The duration of growth consisted 2 +/- 2.3 days for liquid mediums and 40.6 +/- 3.2 days for dense mediums. The method of pre-inoculation processing of surgery material. In case of inoculation of 440 samples in liquid mediums contamination consisted 3.9%. In case of inoculation of bone fragments of focus of destruction in liquid medium Middlebrook 7119 the culture was isolated in 43.5% of samples of patients with tubercular spondylitis.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24757865","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.450578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.28735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.265789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.264844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Liquid","weight":0.261811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.255332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Inoculation","weight":0.241444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Mediumship","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"290","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/290"},{"name":"960","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/960"},{"name":"Horticulture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"},{"name":"Spondylitis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylitis"},{"name":"List of bus routes in London","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_London"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Egg (food)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Food processing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing"},{"name":"Middlebrook, Greater Manchester","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlebrook,_Greater_Manchester"}]}
