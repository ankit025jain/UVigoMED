{"id":65822,"title":"[Scanning electron microscopy of resected ureters in children with ureterohydronephrosis].","abstract":"Using scanning electron microscopy, various portions of the ureter in reflux and obstructive ureterohydronephrosis in children were evaluated. In the first case, architectonics of the distal portions is preserved, while in the second case connective tissue is proliferated. Differences in the structure of proximal and distal portions in both forms of ureterohydronephrosis consist in inflammatory changes and violation of the integrity of the epithelial lining, edema and infiltration of the underlying layers, especially the inner muscle layer of the distal portion. The wall of the ureter in proximal part is much thinner, especially the muscular and mucous layers.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772774","annotations":[{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.738125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Mucus","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.682648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.544348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.504608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.423761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.122318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Infiltration (medical)","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_(medical)"},{"name":"Endometrium","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Neuroimaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"}]}
