Raised anxiety levels with statistically significant difference to control group patients were found. By turn, anxiety levels in patients with chronic hepatitis were lower than in patients with liver cirrhosis. The most of examined patients had middle (with tendency to low level as well as with tendency to high level) and high level of anxiety.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605631","annotations":[{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.691061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.624116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.608697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.400137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Liver diseases","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_diseases"}]}
