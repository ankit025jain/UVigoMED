{"id":64531,"title":"Measurement and evaluation of isotypes of anti-citrullinated fibrinogen and anti-citrullinated alpha-enolase antibodies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis.","abstract":"Our objective was to evaluate sera from juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients to investigate the presence of isotypes (IgA, IgG, IgM) of anti-citrullinated fibrinogen and anti-?-enolase antibodies and their association with rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody isotypes.Sera were obtained from 89 JIA patients and were measured for isotypes (IgA, IgM) of anti-citrullinated and native fibrinogen and anti-?-enolase antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were compared to anti-CCP antibody isotypes and RF isotypes, in addition to previously measured IgG anti-citrullinated fibrinogen and ?-enolase antibodies.IgA anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies were positive in 20 JIA patients and IgM in 11 JIA patients. Two IgM RF-positive polyarthritis patients were positive for all 3 isotypes of anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies. IgA anti-citrullinated ?-enolase antibodies were positive in 7 JIA patients and IgM in 9 JIA patients. IgA and IgG anti-citrullinated fibrinogen antibodies were commonly found in JIA patients positive for IgG anti-CCP antibodies and IgM RF. IgG anti-CCP antibodies and IgM RF levels were significantly higher in JIA patients with 3 or more anti-citrullinated autoantibody isotypes present.We have shown that isotypes of anti-citrullinated fibrinogen and ?-enolase can be found in the serum of children with JIA of all onset types. Citrullinated autoantibody isotype diversity may indicate a more severe disease course in JIA patients.","date":"2014-10-03","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068682","annotations":[{"name":"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis","weight":0.919068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_idiopathic_arthritis"},{"name":"Fibrinogen","weight":0.898571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen"},{"name":"Rheumatoid factor","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_factor"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin M","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_M"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin A","weight":0.802603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.785671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Polyarthritis","weight":0.773916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyarthritis"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Autoantibody","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoantibody"},{"name":"Rheumatism","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatism"},{"name":"Isotype (immunology)","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotype_(immunology)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Enolase","weight":0.0142492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enolase"}]}
