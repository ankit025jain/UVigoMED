{"id":22435,"title":"[Expanding the role of the nursing profession in tuberculosis medical services].","abstract":"Implications of changes in the law regarding the payment system for medical services in 2012 for TB medicine and care include mandatory hospital DOTS, planning and implementing adherence support for patients, patient education, and close cooperation with public-health centers. Nurses are expected to contribute to early diagnosis of TB and treatment completion among high-risk populations by coordinating with the community and relevant organizations. It is also important to clarify roles and establish a network through which necessary information and advice may be sought from specialists. Expanding the role of nursing professions in TB care and medicine is hoped to improve the level of awareness and knowledge among persons involved in TB prevention, care, and medicine.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551954","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.762859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.728398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.715975,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.684428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.640172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.344062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.155016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.118291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Cooperation","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Tuberculosis treatment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_treatment"},{"name":"Payment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment"},{"name":"Payment system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system"},{"name":"Patient education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_education"}]}
