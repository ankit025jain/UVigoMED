{"id":46654,"title":"Hepatic haemangiomatosis: multinodular liver in an asymptomatic elderly man.","abstract":"A 66-year-old man, overweight and a heavy drinker, was sent to our clinic to investigate multiple liver nodules detected on ultrasound. The patient had no symptoms, and physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation disclosed an isolated two-fold increase of ?-glutamyltransferase. The MRI revealed multiple millimetric hypervascular nodules suggestive of liver haemangiomatosis, though malignancy could not be ruled out. Liver biopsy was consistent with hepatic haemangiomatosis. We discuss the differential diagnosis and therapeutical approach of a patient with hepatic haemangiomatosis involving the entire liver without associated symptoms or liver dysfunction.
