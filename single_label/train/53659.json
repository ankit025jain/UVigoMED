{"id":53659,"title":"Clinical characteristics of patients in Japan with ovarian cancer presumably arising from ovarian endometrioma.","abstract":"To investigate the clinical features of patients in Japan with malignant transformation of ovarian endometrioma.Thirty-three patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer presumably arising from endometrioma were recruited retrospectively. These patients had been followed for at least 2 years after the ovarian endometrioma diagnosis, then continued to be followed after they had been found to have malignant transformation.The average age of the patients was 47.7 Â± 9.3 years; 75.7% were premenopausal at the time of diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Among the 33 patients, ovarian cancer developed in the ipsilateral ovary of 6 patients with endometrioma after cystectomy. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with stage I ovarian cancer, and major histotypes were clear cell in 23 cases and endometrioid in 8. Before surgery for cancer, mural nodules within the endometriomas were detected in 32 patients, and 1 patient had a small 3-mm nodule. In 30 patients, the diameter of the tumor doubled in size 6 months prior to the diagnosis of malignant transformation. The diameter of the endometrioma and the preoperative CA125 value did not significantly correlate.To detect malignant transformation of ovarian endometrioma early and precisely, the clinician should determine the existence of a mural nodule and assess the rapid growth of the endometrioma.","date":"2014-03-07","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503885","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.734705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.712788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Malignant transformation","weight":0.614744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_transformation"},{"name":"Endometriosis","weight":0.581217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.544348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"CA-125","weight":0.319407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125"},{"name":"Ovarian cyst","weight":0.237087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cyst"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cystectomy","weight":0.112223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.109678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0542089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Endometrioid tumor","weight":0.0357009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrioid_tumor"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"1967 NHL expansion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_NHL_expansion"},{"name":"Premenopausal","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenopausal"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mural","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mural"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
