{"id":87100,"title":"Sexual risk behaviour and viral suppression among HIV-infected adults receiving medical care in the United States.","abstract":"To describe the prevalence and association of sexual risk behaviours and viral suppression among HIV-infected adults in the United States.Cross-sectional analysis of weighted data from a probability sample of HIV-infected adults receiving outpatient medical care. The facility and patient response rates were 76 and 51%, respectively.We analysed 2009 interview and medical record data. Sexual behaviours were self-reported in the past 12 months. Viral suppression was defined as all viral load measurements in the medical record during the past 12 months less than 200?copies/ml.An estimated 98?022 (24%) HIV-infected adults engaged in unprotected vaginal or anal sex; 50?953 (12%) engaged in unprotected vaginal or anal sex with at least one partner of negative or unknown HIV status; 23?933 (6%) did so while not virally suppressed. Persons who were virally suppressed were less likely than persons who were not suppressed to engage in vaginal or anal sex [prevalence ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82-0.93]; unprotected vaginal or anal sex (prevalence ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-0.98); and unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a partner of negative or unknown HIV status (prevalence ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.99).The majority of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care in the U.S. did not engage in sexual risk behaviours that have the potential to transmit HIV, and of the 12% who did, approximately half were not virally suppressed. Persons who were virally suppressed were less likely than persons who were not suppressed to engage in sexual risk behaviours.","date":"2014-07-08","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000558","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.935129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.740241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.626563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.61692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.607882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.457647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.398298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.38029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Anal sex","weight":0.352918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.27711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.137394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Random sample","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Confidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"820","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/820"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"640","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/640"},{"name":"730","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/730"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Domestic partnership","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership"},{"name":"Structural load","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Inheritance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
