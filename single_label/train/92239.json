{"id":92239,"title":"[The study of new soft one-piece PHEMA keratoprosthesis implanted into alkali burned rabbits cornea].","abstract":"This study was to evaluate clinical results of two types soft one-piece keratoprosthesis (KPros) made of PHEMA implanted to alkali burned rabbit corneas.Experimental study. Twelve pieces KPros were implanted alkali burned rabbit corneas(type I and II, 6 pieces respectively). The examinations including slit-lamp, fundus photography,B-ultrasound and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) were carried out.All Kpros were stable and no complications happened including conjunctiva flap dehiscence, aqueous leak and infection. IOP were normal by finger touch. B-ultrasound show no retina detachment and UBM show synechia in most animals (10 case). Retroprosthetic membrane happened in type I (3 case) . Visible conjunctiva hyperplasia covering the optical region happened in all KPros.(1) The same material, integrated design, maybe eliminating the material interface problem. (2)Simple surgical skills. (3)IOP measurement is possible because of soft material. (4)KPro I do not need removal of the lens and vitrectomy. The projecting portion of KPro II may reduce the incidence of proliferative membrane. Long term effects need more cases and further observation.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433693","annotations":[{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.861234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.818972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.619051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.600869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Alkali","weight":0.490352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.44727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.422038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.363052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Photography","weight":0.238279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"},{"name":"Visible spectrum","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.194493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0562996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Aqueous solution","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_solution"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Synechia (eye)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synechia_(eye)"},{"name":"Fundus (eye)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundus_(eye)"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"UBM plc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBM_plc"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Detachment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment"},{"name":"Leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"},{"name":"Touchscreen","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Interface (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Integrated design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_design"},{"name":"Dehiscence (botany)","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"}]}
