{"id":47425,"title":"MTP -493G>T polymorphism and susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Microsomal transfer protein (MTP), a lipid transfer protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and enterocytes, plays an important role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Many existing studies have demonstrated that a common polymorphism (-493G>T, rs1800591 G>T) in the MTP gene may be implicated in the development and progression of NAFLD, but individually published results are inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether MTP -493G>T polymorphism may be a potential risk factor for NAFLD. We searched CISCOM, CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases from inception through October 1, 2013. Meta-analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 software. Eleven clinical case-control studies with a total of 636 NAFLD cases and 918 healthy controls met the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis results revealed that MTP -493G>T polymorphism was strongly correlated with an increased risk of NAFLD. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity suggested that MTP -493G>T polymorphism might increase individuals' susceptibility to NAFLD among both Caucasian and non-Caucasian populations. No publication bias was observed in this meta-analysis. In short, the present meta-analysis indicates that MTP -493G>T polymorphisms may contribute to individuals' susceptibility to NAFLD. Thus, MTP -493G>T polymorphism may be a valuable and practical biomarker for early detection of NAFLD.","date":"2014-05-29","categories":"Digestive System
