{"id":11252,"title":"Factors associated with offal, partial and whole carcass condemnation in ten French cattle slaughterhouses.","abstract":"The proportion of cattle with offal, partial or whole carcass condemnation could be a useful indicator for animal health syndromic surveillance purposes. It requires first highlighting the factors associated with condemnation in order to include them in a modeling process. This study aims to identify and quantify these factors. It was based on data from ten French cattle slaughterhouses from 2006 to 2010 (n=1,439,868 cattle). Multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. Sex, age and slaughterhouse were the main effects for offal, partial and whole carcass condemnation and have to be taken into account when implementing syndromic surveillance systems based on meat inspection data. The presence of an error in cattle identification was identified as a potential indicator for a higher risk of condemnation and should be explored as a potential factor for risk-based meat inspection.
