{"id":51124,"title":"Impact of dietary modification of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on the hormonal and metabolic profile of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).","abstract":"To investigate the impact of dietary intervention on Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) intake on the hormonal and metabolic profile in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).After baseline evaluation, 23 women with PCOS [mean ± SD, age: 23.4 ± 5.7 years; body mass index (BMI): 26 ± 5.7 kg/m2] underwent the following consecutive 2-month dietary regimens: a hypocaloric diet with ad-libitum AGEs content (Hypo), an isocaloric diet with high AGEs (HA) and an isocaloric diet with low AGEs (LA). Metabolic, hormonal and oxidative stress status was assessed and AGEs levels were determined in all subjects after the completion of each dietary intervention.Serum levels of AGEs, testosterone, oxidative stress, insulin and HOMA-IR index were significantly increased on the HA compared to the Hypo diet and subsequently decreased on the LA diet (compared to HA) (p<0.05 for all parameters). BMI remained unaltered throughout the HA and LA periods compared to the Hypo period. Serum AGEs were strongly correlated with insulin, as well as with HOMA, during the LA dietary period (r=0.53, p=0.02 and r=0.51, p=0.03, respectively). For the same period, dietary AGEs were correlated with insulin levels (rho=0.49, p=0.04).Modifications of dietary AGEs intake are associated with parallel changes in serum AGEs, metabolic, hormonal and oxidative stress biomarkers in women with PCOS. These novel findings support recommendations for a low AGEs dietary content along with lifestyle changes in women with PCOS.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722128","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.846453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Testosterone","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.822923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.822325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Dieting","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieting"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.625981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.325655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Glycation","weight":0.164423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.16081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Advanced glycation end-product","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Los Angeles","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Parallel (geometry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_(geometry)"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Homeostatic model assessment","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostatic_model_assessment"},{"name":"Genetic engineering","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering"}]}
