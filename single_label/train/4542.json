{"id":4542,"title":"[Seeing the sounds--chest and lung ultrasonography].","abstract":"Chest ultrasonography was considered hampered and deficient but it is now taking a prominent role as a bedside tool for the diagnosis of lung ailments. Technological development has made it accurate, fast and reliable to the extent that it is gradually replacing the traditional chest X-ray and sometimes also the computed tomography scan. In this article we review and display in a few images the diagnostic possibilities of the thoracic ultrasound examination in a diverse range of maladies such as pneumonia, pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion and other conditions.","date":"2014-12-18","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518079","annotations":[{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Pulmonary edema","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_edema"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Pleural cavity","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.57066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.478734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.389089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Effusion","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effusion"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
