{"id":77579,"title":"[Current status of measures against prevention of occupational diseases in Japan].","abstract":"In Japan, measures against prevention of occupational diseases are carried out by legal regulations. The superordinate law is the Labor Standards Law, and the Industrial Safety and Health Law(ISHL) and related Ordinances were promulgated in 1972. Abiding by the ISHL and the Ordinances, the employers are required to execute health checkups, assessment of working conditions, improvement of work environment, installation of exposure protection devices/facilities, and so forth to prevent employees from the occupational diseases. Since 2005, the employers are also requested to voluntarily perform health risk assessment and management activities by themselves to avoid health risk due to hazardous conditions unregulated by the ISHL and the Ordinances.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Occupational Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605516","annotations":[{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Occupational disease","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_disease"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.713516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.685627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.621473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.610716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Industry","weight":0.533539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.531257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.491925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.490315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.41933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.320678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Workplace safety","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_safety"},{"name":"Australian Labor Party","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Health risk assessment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_risk_assessment"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Occupational therapy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"},{"name":"1972","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Installation art","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_art"},{"name":"General medical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_medical_examination"},{"name":"Diving suit","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_suit"},{"name":"Promulgation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promulgation"},{"name":"Local ordinance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ordinance"}]}
