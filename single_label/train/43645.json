{"id":43645,"title":"Central motor and sensory conduction in patients with hepatic myelopathy.","abstract":"Experimental neurophysiological study.The hepatic myelopathy (HM) is characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower extremities, while there are only a few reports of sensory impairment. However, sensory function has been poorly explored in HM. We believe that an electrophysiological assessment of dorsal columns by somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and of cortico-spinal lateral tracts by motor evoked potentials (MEPs) should be of considerable value in the functional evaluation of the spinal cord involvement in patients with HM.Salzburg (Austria) and Merano (Italy).Eight patients diagnosed with HM were studied with MEPs and SEPs. Neurological examination revealed different degrees of cortico-spinal tract involvement in all patients and sensory abnormalities in three patients.Central motor conduction to lower limb muscles was abnormal in all patients, while central sensory conduction was abnormal in seven out of the eight patients. Both central motor and sensory conduction to upper limbs are normal in all patients.The main finding is that electrophysiological evidence of central sensory involvement is present in a very high percentage of patients with HM, and that the threshold for electrophysiological abnormalities is below that for clinical manifestations. Therefore, central sensory and motor conduction studies are sensitive methods for detecting, localizing and monitoring spinal cord damage in HM.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24777163","annotations":[{"name":"Corticospinal tract","weight":0.90168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticospinal_tract"},{"name":"Spasticity","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Somatosensory system","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatosensory_system"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Evoked potential","weight":0.657951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evoked_potential"},{"name":"Electrophysiology","weight":0.635256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.590478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.585294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.574442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Neurological examination","weight":0.533237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_examination"},{"name":"Neurophysiology","weight":0.406674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophysiology"},{"name":"Posterior column","weight":0.366073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_column"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.362591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.295642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Motor neuron","weight":0.289344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_neuron"},{"name":"Upper limb","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_limb"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.113788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.0387277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Member of the European Parliament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament"},{"name":"Myelopathy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelopathy"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Austria","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Central Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sensory deprivation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_deprivation"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"}]}
