{"id":51868,"title":"Impairment of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal adduct formation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in mice fed a high-fat diet and injected with low-dose streptozotocin.","abstract":"Reactive aldehydes such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) are generated in the myocardium in cardiac disease. 4HNE and other toxic aldehydes form adducts with proteins, leading to cell damage and organ dysfunction. Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) metabolize toxic aldehydes such as 4HNE into nontoxic metabolites. Both ALDH levels and activity are reduced in cardiac disease. We examined whether reduced ALDH2 activity contributes to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in mice fed a high-fat diet and injected with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ). These mice exhibited most of the characteristics of metabolic syndrome/type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM): increased blood glucose levels depicting hyperglycemia (415.2 ± 18.7 mg/dL vs. 265.2 ± 7.6 mg/dL; P < 0.05), glucose intolerance with normal plasma insulin levels, suggesting insulin resistance and obesity as evident from increased weight (44 ± 3.1 vs. 34.50 ± 1.32 g; P < 0.05) and body fat. Myocardial ALDH2 activity was 60% lower in these mice (0.1 ± 0.012 vs. 0.04 ± 0.015 µmol/min/mg protein; P < 0.05). Myocardial 4HNE levels were also elevated in the hyperglycemic hearts. Co-immunoprecipitation study showed that 4HNE formed adducts on myocardial ALDH2 protein in the mice exhibiting metabolic syndrome/type-2 DM, and they had obvious cardiac hypertrophy compared with controls as evident from increased heart weight (HW), HW to tibial length ratio, left ventricular (LV) mass and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was correlated inversely with ALDH2 activity (R (2 )= 0.7; P < 0.05). Finally, cardiac dysfunction was observed in mice with metabolic syndrome/type-2 DM. Therefore, we conclude that reduced ALDH2 activity may contribute to cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in mice presenting with some of the characteristics of metabolic syndrome/type-2 DM when on a high-fat diet and low-dose STZ injection.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System
