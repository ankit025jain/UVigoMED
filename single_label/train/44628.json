{"id":44628,"title":"[Apparent life-threatening events due to cow's milk allergy in infants].","abstract":"The analysis of an apparent life-threatening event is mainly based on the clinical approach. When the event occurs after a meal, the diagnosis of acid gastroesophageal reflux complicated by esophagitis is suspected first. Cow's milk protein allergy is suspected when the event occurs during weaning from breastfeeding or when it is accompanied by urticaria or relapses when cow's milk is reintroduced. We report on two cases of an apparent life-threatening event associated with cow's milk protein allergy, whose symptoms and first diagnostic approach initially delayed diagnosis. Clinical manifestations of food allergy need to be known in order to avoid errors in diagnostic orientation and therapy, which may be responsible for more severe recurrences.
