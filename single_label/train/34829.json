{"id":34829,"title":"Surgical results of developmental dysplasia of the hip in older children based on using three-dimensional computed tomography.","abstract":"The surgical management of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in older children has been the subject of controversy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome in patients with neglected DDH who underwent individual procedures based on using three-dimensional computed tomography.Forty-seven patients (59 hips) were treated using Pemberton osteotomy or Dega plus Pemberton osteotomy. Subtrochanteric transverse femoral shortening and derotation osteotomy were performed for all patients. The average age at the time of surgery was 10.5 y for group 1 (bilateral dislocation, 24 hips) and 11.2 y for group 2 (unilateral dislocation, 35 hips). Mean follow-up was 5.3 y for group 1 and 5.8 y for group 2.At the end of follow-up, 13 hips (54.2%) were rated excellent, eight hips (33.3%) were good, and three hips (12.5%) were fair in group 1. In group 2, 20 hips (57.1%) were rated excellent, 10 hips (28.6%) were good, and five hips (14.3%) were fair. There were five patients who had a limb length discrepancy of approximately 1.5 cm in group 2. Six hips in group 1 and seven hips in group 2 had osteonecrosis of varying severity.We believe that preoperation three-dimensional computed tomography evaluation, personalized operation plans, and experience with the surgical procedure are the main reasons for the satisfactory therapeutic effects achieved in this study in older children with DDH.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24703507","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.782634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.691096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.591498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.383807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.318828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.233715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hip dysplasia (human)","weight":0.194585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_dysplasia_(human)"},{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.104316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0457163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Shortening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening"},{"name":"Personalization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Iroquois class destroyer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_class_destroyer"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"},{"name":"Dega","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dega"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
