{"id":91746,"title":"The use of the Rey 15-Item Test and recognition trial to evaluate noncredible effort after pediatric mild traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"The Rey 15-Item Test (FIT) is a performance validity test commonly used in adult neuropsychological assessment. FIT classification statistics across studies have been variable, so a recognition trial was created to enhance the measure (Boone, K. B., Salazar, X., Lu, P., Warner-Chacon, K., & Razani, J. (2002). The Rey 15-Item recognition trial: A technique to enhance sensitivity of the Rey 15-Item Memorization Test. Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, 24(5), 561-573.). The current study assessed the utility of the FIT and recognition trial in a pediatric mild traumatic brain injury sample (N = 319, M = 14.57 years). All participants were administered the FIT and recognition trial as part of an abbreviated clinical neuropsychological evaluation. Failure on the Medical Symptom Validity Test was used as the criterion for noncredible effort. Fifteen percent of the sample met the criterion. The traditional adult cutoff score of <9 on the FIT recall trial yielded excellent specificity (98%), but very poor sensitivity (12%). When the recognition trial was utilized, a total score of <26 resulted in the best combined cutoff score (sensitivity = 55%, specificity = 91%). Results indicate that the FIT with recognition trial may be useful in the assessment of noncredible effort with children and adolescents, at least among relatively high-functioning populations.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479707","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.861788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Neuropsychology","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.65762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.592382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Acquired brain injury","weight":0.566639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.534199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Neuropsychological assessment","weight":0.47492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychological_assessment"},{"name":"Concussion","weight":0.453799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.348449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.122372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Recall (memory)","weight":0.117799,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_(memory)"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0604754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0388964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Test cricket","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"},{"name":"319","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/319"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Rey, Iran","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey,_Iran"},{"name":"Fashion Institute of Technology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Institute_of_Technology"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Failure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure"},{"name":"Salazar","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salazar"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Categorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Memorization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorization"},{"name":"Cutscore","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscore"},{"name":"List of glossing abbreviations","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_glossing_abbreviations"}]}
