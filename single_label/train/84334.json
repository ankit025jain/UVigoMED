{"id":84334,"title":"A preoperative scoring system to select patients for arthroscopic subacromial decompression.","abstract":"This study investigated the clinical and radiographic factors that influence outcome after arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASAD) for shoulder impingement syndrome. The goal was to develop a new preoperative scoring system to identify patients who would have a prompt and sustained benefit from ASAD.We prospectively reviewed 112 consecutive patients with impingement syndrome who subsequently underwent ASAD. The Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) was recorded preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperatively. A statistically significant improvement in OSS at 3 months after surgery was considered a good outcome.The variables associated with good outcome were shoulder pain with overhead activities, persistent symptoms for more than 6 months, symptoms persistent despite a 3-month course of supervised physiotherapy, consistently positive Hawkins test result, radiologic changes of impingement on both acromion and humerus in the subacromial region, and improvement for more than 1 week after a steroid injection. These 6 criteria were combined into a single score for this study, termed the preoperative score (PrOS). Sixty-two patients who had been symptomatic for 1 year with a preoperative score of 5 to 6 showed significant improvement in OSS at 3 months after surgery (P < .001). Thirty-eight patients with a score 3 to 4 had no statistically significant improvement in OSS at 3 months but had a further slight improvement at 1 year. Twelve patients with a score of ?2 had no significant improvement in OSS at 3 months or 1 year.This scoring system can identify patients who would have a prompt benefit from ASAD. The impact of surgery in patients with a PrOS of ?4 points is questionable.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25127909","annotations":[{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Humerus","weight":0.796211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.677973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.629896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.620194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.542155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.36771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.173712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Office of Strategic Services","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services"},{"name":"Acromion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromion"},{"name":"Shoulder problem","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_problem"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Oxford","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Decompression sickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"}]}
