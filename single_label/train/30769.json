{"id":30769,"title":"Dokha: an emerging public health issue as a form of tobacco smoking in the middle East.","abstract":"Tobacco use is one of the leading causes of preventable death across the world today and the smoking rates among men in the Arab world are amongst the highest in the world. Smoking of dokha, a traditional Arab tobacco is common in some of the Middle East countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Iran. This review focuses on the prevalence, pattern and health effects of dokha use in the Middle East. For this purpose an electronic search was performed in the following databases and websites: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Proquest and Google scholar up to December 2012. The search strategy was based on Internet search for the synonyms of dohka or midwakh. From the results of the review it emerged that younger people are the most common users of dokha. Hence effective outreach health education programs, targeting adolescents, especially school students before they take up the habit of smoking, may thus curb the emergence of the problem.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460251","annotations":[{"name":"Iran","weight":0.928991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"United Arab Emirates","weight":0.902918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.798987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.715993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Middle East","weight":0.644708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Arab world","weight":0.58362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.534556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Arab people","weight":0.396728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people"},{"name":"Google","weight":0.39465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.371952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.340999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"School","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.124458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Web search engine","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine"},{"name":"Synonym","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"},{"name":"Scholar","weight":0.0354412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholar"},{"name":"ProQuest","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProQuest"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Google Scholar","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Scholar"},{"name":"Midwakh","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwakh"},{"name":"Emergence","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Emirates (airline)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_(airline)"},{"name":"2012 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Electronic music","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Particulates","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"}]}
