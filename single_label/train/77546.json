{"id":77546,"title":"Occupational asthma: an overview.","abstract":"Occupational asthma is a form of asthma that is often under-diagnosed and under-reported. Unrecognized occupational asthma can lead to progression of disease and increased morbidity. The medical history is a critical element for establishing a diagnosis of OA. The history should include a detailed assessment of the workplace environment, the work process, changes in symptoms in and away from the workplace, and a review of relevant material safety data sheets that may provide clues regarding exposure(s) and the potential cause(s). Objective testing including spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilators, peak expiratory flow rate monitoring in and out of the workplace, provocation testing (i.e., methacholine challenge) to assess for airway hyperresponsiveness, and, if feasible, specific provocation by experienced personnel in a controlled setting to a suspected inciting agent are necessary for confirming a diagnosis. Skin or serologic testing for specific IgE to aeroallergens to assess the worker's atopic status is useful especially when considering certain forms of OA where atopy is a risk factor. Specialized laboratory testing may be useful for specific OA causes. It is important to correctly make the diagnosis of OA as the impact on the worker's future employment and earning power can be significantly affected.
