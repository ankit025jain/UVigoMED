{"id":61155,"title":"A phase I study of two dosing schedules of volasertib (BI 6727), an intravenous polo-like kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid malignancies.","abstract":"Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) has an important role in mitosis. Volasertib (BI 6727), a potent and selective cell cycle kinase inhibitor, induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis by targeting Plk; this phase I study sought to determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Asian patients with advanced solid tumours.Patients were enrolled simultaneously into two 3-week schedules of volasertib: a 2-h infusion on day 1 (schedule A) or days 1 and 8 (schedule B). Dose escalation followed a 3+3 design. The MTD was determined based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in the first treatment course.Among 59 treated patients, the most common first course DLTs were reversible thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia; MTDs were 300?mg for schedule A and 150?mg for schedule B. Volasertib exhibited multi-exponential pharmacokinetics (PK), a long terminal half-life of ?135?h, a large volume of distribution (>3000?l), and a moderate clearance. Partial responses were observed in two pre-treated patients (ureteral cancer; melanoma). Volasertib was generally well tolerated, with an adverse event profile consistent with its antimitotic mode of action and a favourable PK profile.These data support further development of volasertib and a harmonised dosing for Asian and Caucasian patients.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755882","annotations":[{"name":"Mitosis","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.825143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.720731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Volume of distribution","weight":0.701504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_of_distribution"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.668329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.634911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.539577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.36538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Febrile neutropenia","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_neutropenia"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.148115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Maximum tolerated dose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_tolerated_dose"},{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.0277849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0239857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0219197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0195416,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"PLK1","weight":0.013474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLK1"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
