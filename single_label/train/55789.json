{"id":55789,"title":"Use of crawford tube for chronic suppurative lacrimal canaliculitis.","abstract":"To assess the effectiveness of the Crawford tube for the treatment of chronic suppurative lacrimal canaliculitis.A prospective study was performed on 8 consecutive patients who accepted the Crawford tube to treat chronic suppurative lacrimal canaliculitis. Postoperatively, the patients were treated with 0.5% levofloxacin eyedrops 4 times per day and oral levofloxacin tablets 0.5 g once per day for 4 days. Follow-up times were >3 months after removing the Crawford tube. The condition of the lacrimal punctum and patient's symptoms were carefully evaluated.All patients had unilateral single canaliculus involvement and had excellent resolution of canaliculitis without the need for surgical treatment. Complications included lacrimal punctum granulation and lacrimal punctum dehiscence.The insertion of the Crawford tube may offer an alternative to surgery in the management of suppurative lacrimal canaliculitis.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807537","annotations":[{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.468165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Levofloxacin","weight":0.280063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levofloxacin"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lacrimal punctum","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_punctum"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.0194145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.0177912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Granulation tissue","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue"},{"name":"Lacrimal canaliculi","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_canaliculi"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Tag_Team_Champions_(WWE)"},{"name":"Wound dehiscence","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_dehiscence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
