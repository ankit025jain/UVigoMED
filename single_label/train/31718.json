{"id":31718,"title":"[Identification of a novel splicing mutation in COL1A1 gene in a Chinese family affected with type?osteogenesis imperfecta].","abstract":"To investigate the genetic cause for a large family affected with type?osteogenesis imperfecta.Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral venous blood samples. The entire coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the COL1A1 gene were subjected to PCR amplification and direct sequencing. Total RNA was also extracted from immortalized B cell lines from the patients, with the first strand of cDNA synthesized with an oligo(dT)18 primer. The PCR products were directly sequenced using the TA cloned plasmid.A c.3208G>A mutation has been identified in the COL1A1 gene, which can alter the splicing pattern of mRNA.A novel splicing mutation c.3208G>A of the COL1A1 gene probably underlies the disease.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25119913","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"Plasmid","weight":0.866808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Complementary DNA","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.771715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"RNA splicing","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.765477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Primer (molecular biology)","weight":0.707618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(molecular_biology)"},{"name":"Biological immortality","weight":0.659464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_immortality"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.459516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.431787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.405524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.202805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"China","weight":0.11418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Genetic algorithm","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Variegation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation"},{"name":"Product (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"}]}
