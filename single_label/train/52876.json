{"id":52876,"title":"Method for obtaining primary ovarian cancer cells from solid specimens.","abstract":"Reliable tools for investigating ovarian cancer initiation and progression are urgently needed. While the use of ovarian cancer cell lines remains a valuable tool for understanding ovarian cancer, their use has many limitations. These include the lack of heterogeneity and the plethora of genetic alterations associated with extended in vitro passaging. Here we describe a method that allows for rapid establishment of primary ovarian cancer cells form solid clinical specimens collected at the time of surgery. The method consists of subjecting clinical specimens to enzymatic digestion for 30 min. The isolated cell suspension is allowed to grow and can be used for downstream application including drug screening. The advantage of primary ovarian cancer cell lines over established ovarian cancer cell lines is that they are representative of the original specific clinical specimens they are derived from and can be derived from different sites whether primary or metastatic ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24562185","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Digestion","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.70736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.564585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.502214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.449875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.358118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.349897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.29681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Drug test","weight":0.133827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.108111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Suspension (chemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
