{"id":77173,"title":"TMPRSS13 deficiency impairs stratum corneum formation and epidermal barrier acquisition.","abstract":"Membrane-anchored serine proteases serve as important regulators of multiple developmental and homoeostatic processes in mammals. TMPRSS13 (transmembrane protease, serine 13; also known as mosaic serine protease large-form, MSPL) is a membrane-anchored serine protease with unknown biological functions. In the present study, we used mice with the Tmprss13 gene disrupted by a ?-galactosidase-neomycin fusion gene insertion to study the expression and function of the membrane-anchored serine protease. High levels of Tmprss13 expression were found in the epithelia of the oral cavity, upper digestive tract and skin. Compatible with this expression pattern, Tmprss13-deficient mice displayed abnormal skin development, leading to a compromised barrier function, as measured by the transepidermal fluid loss rate of newborn mice. The present study provides the first biological function for the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS13.
