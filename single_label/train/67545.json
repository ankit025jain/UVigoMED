{"id":67545,"title":"Advances in the methods for discovering novel painful bladder syndrome therapies.","abstract":"Advances in the treatment of interstitial cystitis or bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) depend on a good understanding of its pathogenesis. Presently, oral medicine and intravesical drug instillations may be the most popular therapies in daily practice. To improve the efficacy of intravesical drug delivery, the system requires modulation through coupling them to novel carriers. Numerous investigators have attempted alternative reconstructive procedures for bladder replacement/repair using scaffolds. These scaffolds include acellular extracellular matrix grafts or tissue-derived cell-seeded extracellular matrix grafts as well as the transplantation of mesenchymal progenitor cells into the damaged bladder.This review focuses on the current available IC/BPS treatments and the different strategies employing nanotechnology or tissue engineering in the discovery of novel IC/BPS therapies.Current studies in the discovery of novel IC/BPS therapies are still imperfect, with novel approaches that use biocompatible nanomaterials or tissue engineering still ongoing. These nanoformulations give the benefit of protecting easily degradable molecules and enhance targeted delivery. Tissue engineering holds the promise of regenerating damaged tissues and organs by replacing damaged tissue and/or by stimulating the body's own repair mechanisms to heal previously irreparable tissues and organs. For these reasons, nanotechnology and tissue engineering could play key roles in the discovery of novel painful bladder syndrome therapies.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606198","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue engineering","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_engineering"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Extracellular","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","weight":0.798868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.792698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.791862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Biocompatibility","weight":0.787556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocompatibility"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.661366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.607424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.554331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.426483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.422042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Drug delivery","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_delivery"},{"name":"Nanomaterials","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomaterials"},{"name":"Cystitis","weight":0.345284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystitis"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.330124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.3113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Engineering","weight":0.23094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0776294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Targeted drug delivery","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_drug_delivery"},{"name":"Reconstructive surgery","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_surgery"},{"name":"Interstitial cystitis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_cystitis"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Non-cellular life","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cellular_life"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Flower","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower"}]}
