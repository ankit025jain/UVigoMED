{"id":68357,"title":"Review article: advances in the management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related renal dysfunction.","abstract":"In cirrhosis, portal hypertension is associated with a spectrum of renal dysfunction that has significant implications for morbidity and mortality.To discuss recent progress in the patho-physiological mechanisms and therapeutic options for portal hypertension-related renal dysfunction.A literature search using Pubmed was performed.Portal hypertension-related renal dysfunction occurs in the setting of marked neuro-humoral and circulatory derangement. A systemic inflammatory response is a pathogenetic factor in advanced disease. Such physiological changes render the individual vulnerable to further deterioration of renal function. Patients are primed to develop acute kidney injury when exposed to additional 'hits', such as sepsis. Recent progress has been made regarding our understanding of the aetiopathogenesis. However, treatment options once hepatorenal syndrome develops are limited, and prognosis remains poor. Various strategies to prevent acute kidney injury are suggested.Prevention of acute kidney injury in high risk patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related renal dysfunction should be a clinical priority.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528130","annotations":[{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.820237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Acute kidney injury","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.803478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Hepatorenal syndrome","weight":0.742736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome"},{"name":"Portal hypertension","weight":0.732147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_hypertension"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.694294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.614581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.547072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Nephrotoxicity","weight":0.46934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotoxicity"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.313159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","weight":0.26327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_inflammatory_response_syndrome"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0366575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Hepatic portal vein","weight":0.0353015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
