{"id":85422,"title":"[Randomized, double-blind, multi-center, positive parallel control clinical trial of compound Wuzhigan capsules on anemopyretic cold].","abstract":"Compound Wuzhigan capsules is a compound preparation composed of Wuzhigan, Shidagonglao, Gangmei, Shanzhima. A Randomized, double-blind, multi-center, positive parallel control designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of compound Wuzhigan capsules on anemopyretic cold. One hundred and twenty anemopyretic cold patients were given compound Wuzhigan capsules (test group), 2 capsules one time, three times a day, 119 patients were given compound Wuzhigan tablets (control group) ,4 tablets one time, three times a day; three days of treatment The study showed, the markedly effective rate and total effective rate respectively were 63. 3% and 80% of the test group. For the control group, the markedly effective rate and total effective rate respectively were 72. 5% and 80. 7%. The difference was not statistically significant. Compound Wuzhigan capsules can reduce the dosage, and get better patient compliance.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946562","annotations":[{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.829201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.560078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.522886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.522344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.500024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.495494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.492413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.44761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.43102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Capsule (pharmacy)","weight":0.115353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
