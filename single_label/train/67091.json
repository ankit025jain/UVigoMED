{"id":67091,"title":"[Comparative assessment of nephroprotective properties of potassium and calcium channel modulators in experimental renal injury].","abstract":"The experiments in white laboratory rats have shown that a single intragasrtric administration of the new fluorine-containing potassium channel opener flocalin in a dose of 5 mg/kg in the initial stage of sublimate nephropathy increased the glomerular filtration rate, reduced creatininemia, increased urinary creatinine excretion, and decreased proteinuria. Under similar conditions, the administration of the calcium channel blocker diltiazem in a dose of 5 mg/kg (intragasrtric) showed a less pronounced antiproteinuric effect as compared to that of flocalin. A comparative assessment of the influence of flocalin and diltiazem on the basic renal function markers demonstrated predominant nephroprotective effect of flocalin in the treatment of acute toxic nephropathy.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649595","annotations":[{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Proteinuria","weight":0.900148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinuria"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Calcium channel blocker","weight":0.798415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel_blocker"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Glomerulus","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulus"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Calcium channel","weight":0.533551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_channel"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Diltiazem","weight":0.265097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diltiazem"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.196238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Filtration","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration"},{"name":"Potassium channel","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_channel"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Risk assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"},{"name":"Laboratory rat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_rat"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
