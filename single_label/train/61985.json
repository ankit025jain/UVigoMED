{"id":61985,"title":"Interferon apha 2b for treating patients with JAK2V617F positive polycythemia vera and essential thrombocytosis.","abstract":"To investigate interferon (IFN) alpha 2 b for treating patients with JAK2V617F positive polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocytosis (ET).Interferon alpha 2 b was used to treat patients with JAK2V617F positive PV and ET. In control group, hydroxyurea was used. Endpoint of study was to compare rates of hematological and molecular remission.Patients in the interferon alpha 2 b group achieved higher rates of hematologic and molecular remission than patients in the hydroxyurea group, with a lower incidence of thrombosis.Compared with hydroxyurea, interferon alpha 2 b could reduce JAK2V617F load for patients with PV and ET, and achieve higher molecular remission, improve treatment efficacy and reduce complications.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641389","annotations":[{"name":"Hydroxycarbamide","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxycarbamide"},{"name":"Essential thrombocytosis","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Polycythemia vera","weight":0.826077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycythemia_vera"},{"name":"Thrombocytosis","weight":0.798715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytosis"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.795226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.789621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Polycythemia","weight":0.522509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycythemia"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.359322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Janus kinase 2","weight":0.275292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase_2"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0370354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Janus kinase","weight":0.0176659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase"},{"name":"Music video","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"},{"name":"Endpoint (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endpoint_(band)"},{"name":"Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-2_adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Eastern Time Zone","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone"}]}
