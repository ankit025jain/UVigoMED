{"id":13999,"title":"Mutant murine hepatitis virus-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus.","abstract":"The mutant virus Mu-3 was isolated from the soluble receptor-resistant mutant 7 virus (srr7), which is a neuropathogenic strain of the mouse hepatitis virus JHMV, and cloned as a soluble receptor-resistant mutant from the highly neuropathogenic JHMV strain cl-2 virus (cl-2). In order to identify specific characteristics of Mu-3, the pathology of Mu-3-infected mice was compared with that of srr7- and cl-2-infected mice. The neuropathology after Mu-3 infection exhibited a mixed pattern comparable to that induced by srr7 and cl-2 infections. In addition, Mu-3 infection caused marked apoptotic lesions in the hippocampal region, particularly in the CA2 and CA3 subregions, in the brains of all infected mice. In contrast, in cl-2 infection, 10-20% of the infected mice exhibited apoptosis in the hippocampus, which was primarily observed in the CA1 subregion. Apoptosis also occurred in the pyramidal neurons and CD11b-bearing cells. The apoptotic cells, indicated by caspase 3-activation, were a mixed population of infected and a higher number of uninfected cells. These data indicated that apoptosis observed in Mu-3 infection could be induced by the indirect effects of infection in addition to direct effects of the infected cells occurring in a cell-autonomous manner.","date":"2014-01-23","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451095","annotations":[{"name":"Hippocampus","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.839829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.747995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Neuropathology","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Mutant","weight":0.580775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.504846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.466651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.413171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Pyramidal cell","weight":0.255064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidal_cell"},{"name":"Viral hepatitis","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hepatitis"},{"name":"Caspase 3","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase_3"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Serer language","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serer_language"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"1020","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1020"},{"name":"Hippocampus anatomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus_anatomy"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Carbonic anhydrase II","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_anhydrase_II"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Subregion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subregion"},{"name":"Indirect injection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_injection"}]}
