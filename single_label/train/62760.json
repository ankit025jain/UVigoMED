{"id":62760,"title":"Antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress in the erythrocytes of iron deficiency anemic patients supplemented with vitamins.","abstract":"Iron deficiency anemia is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Evidences from epidemiological and clinical studies suggest a possible correlation between antioxidant levels and the anemic disease risk. The present work is to investigate antioxidant levels and lipid peroxidation in anemic patients.A number of 30 patients (15 males and 15 females) were selected for the study. Likewise, 30 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (15 males and 15 females) were selected with their informed consent. Patients and healthy subjects were supplemented with vitamins C and E for 15 days. The lipid peroxidation both in plasma and erythrocyte lysates was determined by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid peroxides. The antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E and total antioxidant activity were also analyzed. The antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were also determined.Based on analysis, we found that the increase in lipid peroxidation was higher in the anemic subjects before vitamin supplementation, which was statistically significant at P<0.05. The antioxidant enzymes were higher in the patients before antioxidant supplementation when compared with patients after vitamin supplementation.Our data revealed higher oxidative stress before vitamin supplementation in iron deficiency anemic patients and after supplementation, lower lipid peroxidation and increased antioxidant vitamins were achieved.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518548","annotations":[{"name":"Superoxide dismutase","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Glutathione peroxidase","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"},{"name":"Iron deficiency anemia","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_anemia"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.872094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Glutathione","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione"},{"name":"Superoxide","weight":0.841827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.82955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Lipid peroxidation","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Peroxide","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxide"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Peroxidase","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxidase"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.760806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Iron deficiency (medicine)","weight":0.702154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.692699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.680356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.598597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.519383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.475564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Plasma (physics)","weight":0.277523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.263635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.219821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Avitaminosis","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Informed consent","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"}]}
