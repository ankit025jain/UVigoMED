{"id":88989,"title":"Local and regional flaps for hand coverage.","abstract":"Hand surgeons are frequently challenged by the unique requirements of soft tissue coverage of the hand. Whereas many smaller soft tissue defects without involvement of deep structures are amenable to healing by secondary intention or skin grafting, larger lesions and those with exposed tendon, bone, or joint often require vascularized coverage that allows rapid healing without wound contraction. The purpose of this review was to present an overview of local and regional flaps commonly used for soft tissue reconstruction within the hand.
