{"id":343,"title":"Textile heart valve: first in-vivo experiment in the aortic position.","abstract":"Non-invasive aortic valve implantation has become an alternative technique to surgical valve replacement in patients at high risk for open-chest surgery. With over 100,000 procedures already performed clinically, the technology is expected to involve less-critical patients in future. Whereas, biological valve tissue is a fragile material when folded for low-diameter catheter insertion purposes, textile polyester is a less-fragile material and may offer an alternative material to replace valve leaflets. One issue related to textile is the porosity of the material, which may induce exaggerated tissue ingrowth. Today, data relating to interactions between living tissues and fabrics used as valve materials are available only in the mitral position. Hence, the study aim was to observe the interaction pattern when the valve is implanted in the aortic position, and to assess the influence of sinus whirls on this pattern.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296455","annotations":[{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.812875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Aortic valve","weight":0.797954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.792133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.698738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.535711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.469573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.447586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.442869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.428652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.411364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Porosity","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity"},{"name":"Polyester","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Textile","weight":0.203362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.0213102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
