{"id":22487,"title":"[Cluster outbreak of MRSA in the community; recognition and approach].","abstract":"Community-acquired infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) mainly affects healthy young people, without health-care related risk factors for MRSA. Patients often present with skin and soft-tissue infections.An 18-year-old woman presented at the casualty department with recurrent purulent skin infections. She proved to be MRSA-positive. Within 6 months, 2 people around her also developed an MRSA infection. Culture showed CA-MRSA, with an identical strain (spa type: t008). Additional screening within her immediate circle identified 4 carriers, 2 of whom had corresponding skin infections.Cluster outbreaks of CA-MRSA require a coordinated approach from both the treating physician and the public health services. The choice of additional investigation among the circle of contacts was the determining factor in breaking the cycle of transmission and reinfection within this cluster.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548593","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.694133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.562106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.335456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.116096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Pus","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pus"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Cluster (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_(band)"},{"name":"Ancients (art group)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancients_(art_group)"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Spa","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"}]}
