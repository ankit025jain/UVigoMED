{"id":81717,"title":"Regenerative effect of azithromycin on periodontitis with different levels of gingival inflammation: three case reports.","abstract":"Azithromycin is an antibiotic belonging to the macrolides. Previous case reports showed that azithromycin has a regenerative effect on periodontal tissue in addition to improving periodontal gingival inflammation. Recently, we experienced three periodontitis cases, all of which showed severe bone loss. However, their gingival inflammatory signs differed greatly. The present case reports evaluated the regenerative effects of azithromycin on periodontitis sites with different clinical signs of gingival inflammation.In Case 1, generalized chronic periodontitis with severe gingival inflammation was treated with azithromycin before periodontal treatment. In contrast, Case 2 presented with few clinical signs of gingival inflammation, but was treated with azithromycin prescribed within a day of scaling and root planing. In Case 3, teeth with moderate gingival inflammation were treated with azithromycin after a series of scaling and root planing.Remarkable alveolar bone growth, regardless of baseline gingival inflammation, was noted in all three cases.The use of adjunctive azithromycin in scaling and root planing may be effective for periodontal tissue regeneration. This property may be independent of the degree of baseline gingival inflammation.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861402","annotations":[{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Scaling and root planing","weight":0.783564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_and_root_planing"},{"name":"Alveolar process","weight":0.775064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_process"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.743944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Chronic periodontitis","weight":0.735177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.704066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Gingiva","weight":0.666252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingiva"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.167801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Pulmonary alveolus","weight":0.148163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus"},{"name":"Macrolide","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.122966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Ossification","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"},{"name":"Azithromycin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"},{"name":"Spaceflight osteopenia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_osteopenia"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Adjunct (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_(grammar)"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Planing (sailing)","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planing_(sailing)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
