{"id":70867,"title":"Sequencing approaches in cancer treatment.","abstract":"Use of sequencing approaches is an important aspect in the field of cancer genomics, where next-generation sequencing has already been utilized for targeting oncogenes or tumour-suppressor genes, that can be sequenced in a short time period. Alterations such as point mutations, insertions/deletions, copy number alterations, chromosomal rearrangements and epigenetic changes are encountered in cancer cell genomes, and application of various NGS technologies in cancer research will encounter such modifications. Rapid advancement in technology has led to exponential growth in the field of genomic analysis. The $1000 Genome Project (in which the goal is to sequence an entire human genome for $1000), and deep sequencing techniques (which have greater accuracy and provide a more complete analysis of the genome), are examples of rapid advancements in the field of cancer genomics. In this mini review, we explore sequencing techniques, correlating their importance in cancer therapy and treatment.
