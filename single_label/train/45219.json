{"id":45219,"title":"A novel use of human acellular dermis for conduit salvage after esophagectomy.","abstract":"Postesophagectomy anastomotic leaks cause significant morbidity and mortality. Esophageal diversion is often required when extensive tissue loss precludes primary repair. We describe a technique in which human acellular dermis (AlloDerm) is used to repair the conduit, and report a series of 3 patients with significant anastomotic dehiscence whose conduits were salvaged using this technique.
