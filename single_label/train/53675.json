{"id":53675,"title":"Perioperative evaluation of glycaemic status in neck dissection: a retrospective analysis at a single hospital centre.","abstract":"Diabetes mellitus is generally considered a risk factor for impaired wound healing. This study aimed to evaluate the glycaemic status of patients undergoing neck dissection and describe its impact on postoperative outcomes, especially wound healing. A retrospective analysis was performed of the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative glycaemic data obtained from the medical charts of 60 adult patients who had undergone 64 neck dissections. Nine of the 64 procedures were performed in diabetic patients (14.1%). The average glucose values were: preoperative 5.99 ± 1.25 mmol/l, intraoperative 8.90 ± 2.62 mmol/l, and postoperative 10.01 ± 2.49 mmol/l. All registered preoperative hyperglycaemia cases (eight cases) were diabetic. Postoperative insulin therapy was done in 14 procedures (21.9%). Wound healing complications were found in five patients (7.8%); there was no wound infection. There was no association of wound healing complications with preoperative diabetic status (P = 1.000), preoperative glucose control (P = 1.000), preoperative (P=0.469), intraoperative (P = 0.248), and postoperative (P = 0.158) glucose values, or with postoperative glucose control (P = 0.577). These data do not support the association of stress-induced hyperglycaemia or diabetes mellitus with postoperative wound healing problems in neck dissection.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503103","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hyperglycemia","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.79352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.383578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.315729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Insulin therapy","weight":0.0964716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_therapy"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"577","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/577"},{"name":"248","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/248"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Centre (ice hockey)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Trademark","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"},{"name":"Straight pool","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
