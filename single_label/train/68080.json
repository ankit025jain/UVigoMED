{"id":68080,"title":"[Analysis of postoperative urgenturies after prostate photovaporization by the laser Greenlight Â®].","abstract":"Urgencies are classically described after prostate photovaporization (PVP). The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence of urgency in patients who underwent PVP using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to defined urgencies.This is a single-center prospective cohort study assessing patients who underwent surgery between May 2005 and January 2011. The questions 2 and 4 of the IPSS and open questions were selected to evaluate urgency during the follow-up.Two-hundred and four patients were operated during this period and 93 complete records were analyzed. Twenty-one percent of these patients had a clinical urgency after 1 month and 1,9% at 12 months (significant improvement, P<0.001) corresponding to scores greater than 4 for questions 2 and 4 of the IPSS. Answer scores to questions 2 and 4 improved significantly over 12 months (P<0.001). The clinical urgencies decreased significantly as well as answers to questions 2 and 4 of the IPSS.Urgencies decreased significantly between 3 and 12 months of postoperative follow. Questions 2 and 4 of the IPSS score appeared to be a standardized definition of these urgencies.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560209","annotations":[{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.502548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.322139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Classical music","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music"},{"name":"International Prostate Symptom Score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prostate_Symptom_Score"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Player versus player","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player"},{"name":"Green-light","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-light"},{"name":"Open problem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_problem"},{"name":"Urgent care","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urgent_care"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Answer (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_(comics)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"International Packet Switched Service","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Packet_Switched_Service"}]}
