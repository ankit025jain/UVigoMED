{"id":46727,"title":"Rise of [Ca²?]i and apoptosis induced by M-3M3FBS in SCM1 human gastric cancer cells.","abstract":"M-3M3FBS (2,4,6-trimethyl-N-(meta-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-benzenesulfonamide is a presumed phospholipase C activator which induced Ca²? movement and apoptosis in different cell models. How- ever, the effect of m-3M3FBS on cytosolic free Ca²? concentrations ([Ca²?]i) and apoptosis in SCM1 human gastric cancer cells is unclear. This study explored whether m-3M3FBS elevated basal [Ca²?]i levels in suspended cells by using fura-2 as a Ca²?-sensitive fluorescent dye. M-3M3FBS at concentrations between 5-50 ?M increased [Ca²?]i in a concentration-dependent manner. The Ca²? signal was reduced by half by removing extracellular Ca²?. M-3M3FBS-induced Ca²? influx was inhibited by nifedipine, econazole, SK&F96365, aristolochic acid, and GF109203X. In Ca²?-free medium, 50 ?M m-3M3FBS pretreatment inhibited the [Ca²?]i rise induced by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca²? pump inhibitor thapsigargin. Conversely, pretreatment with thapsigargin partly reduced m-3M3FBS-induced [Ca²?]i rise. Suppression of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production with U73122 did not change m-3M3FBS- induced [Ca²?]i rise. At concentrations between 25 and 50 ?M m-3M3FBS killed cells in a concentration- dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of m-3M3FBS was not reversed by prechelating cytosolic Ca²? with acetoxy-methyl ester of bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA/AM). Annexin V/propidium iodide staining data suggest that m-3M3FBS induced apoptosis at 25 and 50 ?M. M-3M3FBS also increased levels of superoxide. Together, in human gastric cancer cells, m-3M3FBS induced a [Ca²?]i rise by inducing phospholipase C-independent Ca²? release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca²? entry via protein kinase C-sensitive store-operated Ca²? channels. M-3M3FBS induced cell death that might involve apoptosis via reactive oxygen species production.
