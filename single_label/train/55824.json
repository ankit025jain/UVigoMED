{"id":55824,"title":"[Giant papillary conjunctivitis].","abstract":"Giant papillary conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is associated with immunological-allergic disorders, but is difficult to integrate as a defined type of illness. The deposits of contact lenses are responsible in predisposed wearers. They induce a special immune answer to their biochemical ingredients. In addition, roughness of the superficial corneal layers and the conjunctiva, even without any contact lenses after filtrating glaucoma surgery, leads to mechanically induced papillary formations. In former days these symptoms of building giant papillae were seen mostly in wearers of soft hydrogel contact lenses. Nowadays manufacturers have developed contact lens systems with a variety of material components, with an increase of protein and lipid deposits. In combination with the observed non-compliance of wearers regarding lens exchange and contact lens hygiene, GPC is an issue which should be taken into consideration again.
