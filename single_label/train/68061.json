{"id":68061,"title":"Maintaining and reprogramming genomic androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer.","abstract":"Prostate cancer treatment is dominated by strategies to control androgen receptor (AR) activity. AR has an impact on prostate cancer development through the regulation of not only transcription networks but also genomic stability and DNA repair, as manifest in the emergence of gene fusions. Whole-genome maps of AR binding sites and transcript profiling have shown changes in the recruitment and regulatory effect of AR on transcription as prostate cancer progresses. Defining other factors that are involved in this reprogramming of AR function gives various opportunities for cancer detection and therapeutic intervention.
