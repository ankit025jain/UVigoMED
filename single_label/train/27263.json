{"id":27263,"title":"[Capabilities of stress echocardiography in diagnosis of cardiovascular pathology and estimation for military service].","abstract":"Annually about 6,5 thousands of military servicemen retire due to cardiovascular diseases, every second serviceman retires before superannuation. Stress echocardiography in comparison with other imaging studies is cheaper, safer and matches in sensibility and specificity. The prevalence of stress echocardiography and stress systems can make it available in district, central and main hospitals, and clinics of the Kirov Military Medical Academy. It is proposed to expand indications for stress echocardiography for certain contingent soldiers: those senior commanders, aircrew, and divers soldiers at high risk of cardiovascular complications. For training of specialists in the filed of stress echocardiography in the Kirov Military Medical Academy themed cycles for medical ultrasound and functional diagnostics are orginised.","date":"2014-07-22","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046936","annotations":[{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.744384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.707034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.687287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.673041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.671518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.647654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.560835,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.414337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.391439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pension","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Kirov Military Medical Academy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirov_Military_Medical_Academy"},{"name":"Retirement","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Bicycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle"},{"name":"Conscription","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Cardiovascular pathology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_pathology"},{"name":"Aircrew","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircrew"},{"name":"Sensibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensibility"},{"name":"Military Medical Academy (Serbia)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medical_Academy_(Serbia)"},{"name":"Scuba diving","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Contingency (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Kirov, Kirov Oblast","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirov,_Kirov_Oblast"}]}
