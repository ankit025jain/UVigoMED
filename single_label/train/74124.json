{"id":74124,"title":"Longitudinal assessment of chemotherapy-induced alterations in brain activation during multitasking and its relation with cognitive complaints.","abstract":"To examine whether cognitive complaints after treatment for breast cancer are associated with detectable changes in brain activity during multitasking.Eighteen patients who were scheduled to receive chemotherapy performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging multitasking task in the scanner before the start of treatment (t1) and 4 to 6 months after finishing treatment (t2). Sixteen patients who were not scheduled to receive chemotherapy and 17 matched healthy controls performed the same task at matched intervals. Task difficulty level was adjusted individually to match performance across participants. Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) software was used for within-group, between-group, and group-by-time interaction image analyses.Voxel-based paired t tests revealed significantly decreased activation (P < .05) from t1 to t2 at matched performance in the multitasking network of chemotherapy-treated patients, whereas no changes were noted in either of the control groups. At baseline, there were no differences between the groups. Furthermore, in contrast to controls, the chemotherapy-treated patients reported a significant increase in cognitive complaints (P < .05) at t2. Significant (P < .05) correlations were found between these increases and decreases in multitasking-related brain activation. Moreover, a significant group-by-time interaction (P < .05) was found whereby chemotherapy-treated patients showed decreased activation and healthy controls did not.These results suggest that changes in brain activity may underlie chemotherapy-induced cognitive complaints. The observed changes might be related to chemotherapy-induced damage to the brain or reduced connectivity between brain regions rather than to changes in effort or changes in functional strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study providing evidence for a relationship between longitudinal changes in cognitive complaints and changes in brain activation after chemotherapy.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24868029","annotations":[{"name":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.765178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Brain damage","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Electroencephalography","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.660539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.631338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.630477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.56273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.475376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Statistical parametric mapping","weight":0.334824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parametric_mapping"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.334722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.234742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"List of regions in the human brain","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Computer multitasking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Difficulty level","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difficulty_level"},{"name":"Synapse","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"Greatest hits album","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_hits_album"},{"name":"Eighteen (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteen_(film)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
