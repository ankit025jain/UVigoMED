{"id":76800,"title":"Associations of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption with metabolic syndrome in a male Chinese population: a cross-sectional study.","abstract":"Whether cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are associated with the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains controversial. This study investigated the associations of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption with MetS in a male population in China.We conducted a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was used to collect data on cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, MetS status, and other related information from 8169 men aged 19-97 years. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between smoking and alcohol consumption and the risk of MetS.The prevalence of MetS was 15.2% in the study population. Proportions of current smokers and drinkers were 48.2% and 46.5%, respectively. Adjusted OR of MetS was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.01-1.79) among smokers who smoked ?40 cigarettes/day compared with nonsmokers and 1.22 (95% CI 1.03-1.46) for those who consumed 0.1-99 grams of alcohol/day compared with nondrinkers. Adjusted OR was 2.32 (95% CI 1.45-3.73) among ex-drinkers who never smoked, 1.98 (95% CI 1.35-2.91) among ex-drinkers who were current smokers, and 1.34 (95% CI 1.08-1.68) among current drinkers who never smoked compared with those who neither smoked nor drank. There was a significant interaction between smoking and drinking alcohol on MetS (P for interaction is 0.001).Our study indicated that smoking and drinking is associated with higher prevalence of MetS. Interactions between smoking and drinking on the risk of MetS in men in China may also exist. Our findings need to be confirmed in future case-control or cohort studies.","date":"2014-09-08","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24910131","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.890718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.757903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.717747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.685313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.569217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.559186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.504832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Cigarette","weight":0.447393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.392935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"China","weight":0.380536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.378664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.215036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0995937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.045004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Smoking (cooking)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
