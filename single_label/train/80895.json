{"id":80895,"title":"Occurrence and molecular analysis of Balantidium coli in mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda.","abstract":"Cysts morphologically resembling Balantidium coli were identified in the feces of a mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei). Confirmatory PCR and sequencing revealed two distinct B. coli-specific sequences (ITS-1, sub-types A0 and B1). This represents the first report of B. coli in this species, raising the possibility of infection from a reservoir host.","date":"2014-02-07","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502743","annotations":[{"name":"Feces","weight":0.773472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.711179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Gorilla","weight":0.682648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.492603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.486326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Internal transcribed spacer","weight":0.442177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_transcribed_spacer"},{"name":"Rwanda","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.355833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.320748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.216901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"Volcano","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Mountain gorilla","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_gorilla"},{"name":"Balantidium coli","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balantidium_coli"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"ISO 216","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216"},{"name":"Subtypes of HIV","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtypes_of_HIV"},{"name":"Volcanoes National Park","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanoes_National_Park"},{"name":"National park","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park"},{"name":"Eastern gorilla","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_gorilla"}]}
