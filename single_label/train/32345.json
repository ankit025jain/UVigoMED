{"id":32345,"title":"[Congenital atresia of left main coronary artery in 4 children: case report and literature review].","abstract":"To investigate the clinical manifestations and treatment of congenital atresia of the left main coronary artery (CLMCA-A).Four patients were diagnosed to have CLMCA-A from June 2010 to June 2012 in Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Clinical manifestations, ultrasound, ECG and angiographic characteristics were analyzed and summarized.Of the 4 cases, age of onset was 3 months to 2 yrs. Three cases were diagnosed by angiography, and 1 case by CTA . All 4 cases had chronic heart failure symptoms and signs, such as sweating, shortness of breath, easily choked by milk, predispose to pneumonia, activity intolerance. ECG showed abnormal Q wave and other ischemic signs such as ST-T segment depression. Ultrasonography showed left ventricular enlargement, left ventricular systolic function was normal or slightly reduced, and there was moderate to large amount of mitral valve regurgitation. Left ventricular trabeculations increased. Coronary collateral circulation increased. Left coronary artery appeared to be slender and disconnected with left coronary artery sinus. Aortic root angiography was the golden diagnostic standard. Angiography was performed in 3 patients and showed that left main coronary artery had a blind end, diameter 1.1-2.0 mm. The right coronary artery was found rising from the right coronary sinus and visible on coronary collateral circulation. Contrast agent developing sequence: right coronary artery-collateral vessels-left coronary artery distal branches-left main coronary artery. CTA exam was performed in 2 cases and in 1 case the diagnoses was confirmed. All the 4 patients are currently in the close follow-up, digoxin and diuretics were taken everyday and clinical symptoms were improved.CLMCA-A is not rare, its clinical manifestations should be differentiated from those of cardiomyopathy, endocardial fibroelastosis, congenital valvular disease and abnormal left coronary artery originating from pulmonary artery etc. For pediatric patients with cardiac enlargement, abnormal heart function, mitral valve regurgitation etc, attention must be paid to consider the developmental abnormality of coronary artery, particularly the CLMCA-A diagnosis.","date":"2014-06-27","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and
