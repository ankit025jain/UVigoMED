{"id":69839,"title":"Activity of a three-drug combination including cisplatin (CLOVER regimen) for poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.","abstract":"No standard treatment has been established for poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PDNEC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the response to the combination of three drugs.We reviewed 21 PDNEC patients treated from 2008 to 2013 in two Institutions. Five patients were initially treated with epirubicin, fluorouracil and temozolomide. Because of toxicity, the regimen was modified into cisplatin, capecitabine and dacarbazine (scheme B-CLOVER regimen).Primary tumor site was: pancreas 7 (33%), lung 5 (24%), colon-rectum 5 (24%), unknown 3 (14%) and stomach 1 (5%). The response rate was 24% (0 complete response, 24% partial responses, 38% stable disease, 9% progression and 19% unassessable). The global overall survival (OS) is 13 months (range=1-29) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 6 months (range=1-11).The combination chemotherapy of cisplatinum, capecitabine and dacarbazine is feasible and should be considered as an option for PDNEC.","date":"2014-10-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275070","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Epirubicin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirubicin"},{"name":"Capecitabine","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capecitabine"},{"name":"Temozolomide","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temozolomide"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Dacarbazine","weight":0.814879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacarbazine"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Fluorouracil","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.566718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.528585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"History of cancer chemotherapy","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cancer_chemotherapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"}]}
