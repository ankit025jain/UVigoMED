{"id":17806,"title":"[Trial helplessness of defendant healthcare facilities in cases concerning nosocomial infections].","abstract":"The number of pecuniary cases involving patient claims due to nosocomial infections has been increasing for many years, and with it, the amount of adjudged compensations has also been increasing. In this situation, it is important for defendant healthcare facilities to implement a proper policy, both before the trial and during the court proceedings. Unfortunately, as a rule, defendant facilities commit a variety of errors, such as: wrong strategy, inability to cooperate on the part of those involved in the matter and improper preparation and usage of evidence. The result is that the risk of unfavorable assessment of the case increases significantly.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847642","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.726519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.336785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Money","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money"},{"name":"Defendant","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0937821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Court","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Learned helplessness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
