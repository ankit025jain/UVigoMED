{"id":78554,"title":"Auditory performance and speech intelligibility of Mandarin-speaking children implanted before age 5.","abstract":"(1) To report the auditory performance and speech intelligibility of 84 Mandarin-speaking prelingually deaf children after using cochlear implants (CIs) for one, two, three, four, and five years to understand how many years of implant use were needed for them to reach a plateau-level performance; (2) to investigate the relation between subjective rating scales and objective measurements (i.e., speech perception tests); (3) to understand the effect of age at implantation on auditory and speech development.Eighty-four children with CIs participated in this study. Their auditory performance and speech intelligibility were rated using the Categorical Auditory Performance (CAP) and the Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) scales, respectively. The evaluations were made before implantation and six months, one, two, three, four, and five years after implantation. At the fifth year after implantation, monosyllabic-word, easy-sentence, and difficult-sentence perception tests were administered.The median CAP score reached a plateau at category 6 after three years of implant use. The median SIR arrived at the highest level after five years of use. With five years of CI experiences, 86% of the subjects understood conversation without lip-reading, and 58% were fully intelligible to all listeners. The three speech perception tests had a moderate-to-strong correlation with the CAP and SIR scores. The children implanted before the age of three years had significantly better CAP and monosyllabic word perception test scores.Five years of follow-up are needed for assessing the post-implantation development of communication ability of prelingually deafened children. It is recommended that hearing-impaired children receive cochlear implantation at a younger age to acquire better auditory ability for developing language skills. Constant postoperative aural-verbal rehabilitation and speech and language therapy are most likely required for the patients to reach the highest level on the CAP and SIR scales.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630030","annotations":[{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Speech perception","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_perception"},{"name":"Speech and language pathology","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_and_language_pathology"},{"name":"Language","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language"},{"name":"Perception","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.790594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Syllable","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.665244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Lip reading","weight":0.583002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_reading"},{"name":"Speech","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.521643,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Word","weight":0.458948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word"},{"name":"Conversation","weight":0.211485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Prelingual deafness","weight":0.153104,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelingual_deafness"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0276285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Sheet music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music"},{"name":"Plateau","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Categorical imperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative"},{"name":"Standardized test","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Social change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change"},{"name":"Mutual intelligibility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility"},{"name":"Belgian Pro League","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Pro_League"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
