{"id":13525,"title":"A newly synthesized compound, 4'-geranyloxyferulic acid-N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester suppresses inflammation-associated colorectal carcinogenesis in male mice.","abstract":"We previously reported the cancer chemopreventive activity of 4'-geranyloxyferulic acid (GOFA, Miyamoto et al., Nutr Cancer 2008; 60:675-84) and a ?-cyclodextrin inclusion compound of GOFA (Tanaka et al., Int J Cancer 2010; 126:830-40) in colitis-related colorectal carcinogenesis. In our study, the chemopreventive effects of a newly synthesized GOFA-containing compound, GOFA-N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), which inhibits inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX) enzymes, were investigated using a colitis-associated mouse colorectal carcinogenesis model with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). The dietary administration of GOFA-L-NAME after the AOM and DSS treatments significantly reduced the multiplicity of adenocarcinomas (inhibition rates: 100 ppm, 84%, p < 0.001; 500 ppm, 94%, p < 0.001) compared with the AOM + DSS group. Dietary GOFA-L-NAME significantly decreased the proliferation (p < 0.001) and increased the apoptosis (p < 0.001) of colonic adenocarcinoma cells. A subsequent short-term experiment revealed that dietary GOFA-L-NAME decreased the mRNA expression of inflammatory enzymes, such as iNOS and COX-2, and proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-?, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 in the colonic mucosa of mice that received 1.5% DSS in their drinking water for 7 days. Our findings indicate that GOFA-L-NAME is able to inhibit colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis by modulating inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in mice.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Animal
