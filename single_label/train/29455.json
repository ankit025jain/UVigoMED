{"id":29455,"title":"[Relationship between recidivism and self-efficacy among inmates of drug-related offences].","abstract":"Aims. Treatment programme for drug-related offenders in Japanese prisons is aimed at acquiring coping skills for preventing recidivism and improving self-efficacy for preventing recidivism. In this study, we examined if improvement of self-efficacy actually contributes to the prevention of recidivism. Methods. In order to measure the relationship between recidivism and self-efficacy, we examined the degree of self-efficacy at the beginning and end of the programme, and we monitored 144 females upon their release from prison. The women were all incarcerated for drug-related offences and had been participated in the self-efficacy programme. Results. In this study, we obtained the following results: 1) Change in self-efficacy through the programme was not statistically significant; 2) The recidivism rate of inmates with high self-efficacy at the end of the program was low; 3) The amount of change in self-efficacy through the programme did not affect the recidivism rate.Enhancing self-efficacy through the programme is effective in preventing recidivism. It is necessary to improve the programme.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660559","annotations":[{"name":"Prison","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison"},{"name":"Incarceration","weight":0.376528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.221289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Recidivism","weight":0.186252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0590403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Japanese language","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Lists of former Guantanamo Bay detainees alleged to have returned to terrorism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_former_Guantanamo_Bay_detainees_alleged_to_have_returned_to_terrorism"},{"name":"Initiative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative"},{"name":"Penal system of Japan","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_system_of_Japan"}]}
