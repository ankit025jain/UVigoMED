{"id":42474,"title":"Section 10. Endoscopic management of biliary complications in adult living donor liver transplantation.","abstract":"Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has become an accepted therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver disease. However, biliary complications remain the major causes of morbidity and mortality for LDLT recipients. Although there are currently no reports of a clear therapeutic algorithm, many approaches have been developed to treat biliary complications, including surgical, endoscopic, and percutaneous transhepatic techniques. Endoscopic treatment is currently the preferred initial treatment for patients that have previously undergone duct-to-duct biliary reconstruction. This article discusses aspects of endoscopic management of biliary complications that occur in adult LDLT.
