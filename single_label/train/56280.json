{"id":56280,"title":"Anti-TNF therapy for juvenile idiopathic arthritis-related uveitis.","abstract":"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-related uveitis is the most common type of uveitis in childhood and one of the main causes of visual impairment in children. The introduction of biological treatment has widened the range of therapeutic options for children with uveitis refractory to standard nonbiologic immunosuppressants. Data from clinical trials suggest that both adalimumab and infliximab have demonstrated effectiveness and safety in open-label studies, although no large, randomized, controlled trials have been reported so far. The role of etanercept in treating juvenile idiopathic arthritis-related uveitis is not yet well defined. In our experience, anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy has been shown to be more effective than steroids and/or methotrexate in treating uveitis. Up to now, tumor necrosis factor blocking compounds have been reserved for the treatment of the most severe cases of refractory uveitis, and larger prospective clinical trials are required in order to better assess the safety of these new compounds.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24711694","annotations":[{"name":"Infliximab","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infliximab"},{"name":"Etanercept","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etanercept"},{"name":"Methotrexate","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methotrexate"},{"name":"Adalimumab","weight":0.888083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab"},{"name":"Uveitis","weight":0.824131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.716307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Immunosuppressant","weight":0.706098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressant"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.670959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tumor necrosis factors","weight":0.56292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_necrosis_factors"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.31588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.135236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Visual impairment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"}]}
