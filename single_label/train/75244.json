{"id":75244,"title":"[Non pharmacological therapies for Alzheimer's].","abstract":"A number of non pharmacological therapies for Alzheimer's disease exist, focusing on cognitive, psycho-social, sensory, physical and environmental aspects. Although their absolute efficacy has not been proven, their results are encouraging. Outpatient therapy to maintain patients' competencies changes how the objectives and methods of patient care are viewed. By establishing individualised, relational care, it aims above all to preserve the patient's quality of life. It recognises the role, contribution and skill of the caregiver.","date":"2014-08-20","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137962","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Alzheimer's disease","weight":0.726557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.600353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.555046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.498923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.42438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.185995,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Theology of relational care","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology_of_relational_care"},{"name":"Autocracy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy"}]}
