{"id":88036,"title":"Office management of mild head injury in children and adolescents.","abstract":"To provide family physicians with updated, practical, evidence-based information about mild head injury (MHI) and concussion in the pediatric population.MEDLINE (1950 to February 2013), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005 to 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2005 to 2013), and DARE (2005 to 2013) were searched using terms relevant to concussion and head trauma. Guidelines, position statements, articles, and original research relevant to MHI were selected.Trauma is the main cause of death in children older than 1 year of age, and within this group head trauma is the leading cause of disability and death. Nine percent of reported athletic injuries in high school students involve MHI. Family physicians need to take a focused history, perform physical and neurologic examinations, use standardized evaluation instruments (Glasgow Coma Scale; the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, version 3; the child version of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool; and the Balance Error Scoring System), instruct parents how to monitor their children, decide when caregivers are not an appropriately responsible resource, follow up with patients promptly, guide a safe return to play and to learning, and decide when neuropsychological testing for longer-term follow-up is required.A thorough history, physical and neurologic assessment, the use of validated tools to provide an objective framework, and periodic follow-up are the basis of family physician management of pediatric MHI.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925941","annotations":[{"name":"Glasgow Coma
