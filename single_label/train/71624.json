{"id":71624,"title":"[Specific features of gene amplification on the long arm of chromosome 17 in different molecular genetic subtypes of breast cancer].","abstract":"The frequency of gene amplification and coamplification of HER2/neu, TOP2A and the centromeric region of chromosome 17 (CEP17) was examined in 265 breast cancer (BC) cases belonging to different molecular genetic subgroups. Luminal B breast cancer was found to be characterized by the increased probability of coamplifications (CEP17 and HER/neu, HER2/neu, and TOP2A) on chromosome 17. At the same time, the amplification of just three loci on one chromosome is a rare event and encountered in 17% of luminal B breast cancer cases (or 1.1% of all BC cases). That of HER2/neu in conjunction with elevated CEP17 count is statistically significantly more rarely accompanied by deletion of TOP2A rather than its amplification. The findings suggest that there are different amplification mechanisms in different BC molecular genetic subgroups.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051718","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Centromere","weight":0.752616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.705739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.693564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Molecular genetics","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_genetics"},{"name":"HER2/neu","weight":0.586474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.319321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.28029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Chromosome 17 (human)","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_17_(human)"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Phenobarbital","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenobarbital"},{"name":"TOP2A","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP2A"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"265","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/265"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"British Columbia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia"},{"name":"Subgroup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Circular error probable","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_error_probable"}]}
