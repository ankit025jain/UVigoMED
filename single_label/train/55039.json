{"id":55039,"title":"Evaluation of corneal stromal demarcation line depth following standard and a modified-accelerated collagen cross-linking protocol.","abstract":"To compare the corneal stromal demarcation line depth using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) after corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) using 2 different treatment protocols: the standard Dresden protocol (30 minutes with 3 mW/cm(2)) and a modified-accelerated protocol (14 minutes with 9 mW/cm(2)).Prospective, comparative study.Forty-three keratoconic patients (52 eyes) were enrolled. All patients underwent CXL using the same high-intensity ultraviolet-A (UV-A) irradiation device. Twenty-six eyes were treated for 30 minutes with 3 mW/cm(2) according to the standard Dresden protocol (Group 1), while 26 eyes were treated with a novel modified-accelerated CXL protocol for 14 minutes with 9 mW/cm(2) of UV-A irradiation intensity (Group 2). One month postoperatively, corneal stromal demarcation line depth was measured by 2 independent observers using AS-OCT.Corneal stromal demarcation line depth was assessed with no significant difference between observer measurements for both groups (P = .676 for Group 1 and P = .566 for Group 2). Mean corneal stromal demarcation line depth was 337.00 ± 46.46 ?m for Group 1 and 322.91 ± 48.28 ?m for Group 2. There was no statistically significant difference (P = .243) in the corneal stromal demarcation line depth between the 2 groups.Corneal stromal demarcation line depth using UV-A with 3 mW/cm(2) for 30 minutes and 9 mW/cm(2) for 14 minutes was similar. A modified-accelerated protocol of 14 minutes of CXL provided the same treatment depth as the classic Dresden protocol.","date":"2014-09-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034113","annotations":[{"name":"Optical coherence tomography","weight":0.76913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography"},{"name":"Ultraviolet","weight":0.518596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"},{"name":"Collagen","weight":0.444348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.37118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.333004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Coherence (physics)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)"},{"name":"Cross-link","weight":0.198592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-link"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Dresden","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden"},{"name":"Anterior segment of eyeball","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_segment_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Roman numerals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"337","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/337"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Border","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Demarcation line","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_line"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"}]}
