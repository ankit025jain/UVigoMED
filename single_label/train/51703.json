{"id":51703,"title":"Novel insights into the potential involvement of 5-HT7 receptors in endocrine dysregulation in stress-related disorders.","abstract":"A hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a common feature of stress-related disorders, and the brain serotonin (5-HT) system plays a major role in HPA axis modulation. Glucocorticoids and stress profoundly affect the 5-HT system so it is possible that alterations of endocrine 5-HT mechanisms may underlie HPA axis overdrive in stress-related diseases. Available evidence suggests a role of 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A/2C and 5-HT7 receptors in HPA system activation, and pharmacological blockade of 5-HT7 receptors produces a fast-acting antidepressant-like action and shortens the onset of antidepressant-like effects of various classes of antidepressants. The mechanisms involved in this effect have not been elucidated, but recent findings suggest a role of 5-HT7 receptors in the development of HPA axis overdrive as a result of chronic stress. Remarkably, clinical findings have shown an association between corticosteroid-producing adenomas and expression of ectopic 5-HT7 receptors in corticosteroid-producing adrenocortical cells. These observations might therefore reveal an endocrine mechanism for the antidepressant-like action of 5-HT7 receptor blockers, possibly through normalization of HPA axis function. If such a preliminary hypothesis is confirmed, the potential therapeutic usefulness of 5-HT7 receptor antagonists could extend beyond depression to include other diseases, the pathophysiology of which has been associated with chronic stress and HPA axis dysregulation.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24663228","annotations":[{"name":"Serotonin","weight":0.848912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Glucocorticoid","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.759865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Endocrine system","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Hyperactivity","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperactivity"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.675724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Adrenal cortex","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"5-HT2A receptor","weight":0.507711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2A_receptor"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis","weight":0.383078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis"},{"name":"Chronic stress","weight":0.377274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress"},{"name":"5-HT1 receptor","weight":0.310211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT1_receptor"},{"name":"HPA axis","weight":0.2824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPA_axis"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.124218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.109174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Ectopic pregnancy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy"},{"name":"Absorption (pharmacokinetics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"},{"name":"5-HT2C receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor"},{"name":"Emotional dysregulation","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
