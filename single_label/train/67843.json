{"id":67843,"title":"Prostate cancer antigen 3: diagnostic outcomes in men presenting with urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 scores ?100.","abstract":"To describe the results of 3 rounds of diagnostic testing and linkage to the Dutch Cancer Registry for men with an initial prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) score ?100.Within an earlier reported comparative study of PCA3 vs prostate-specific antigen in a prescreened population, 90 men with a PCA3 score ?100 were identified and underwent biopsy, 28 prostate cancers (PCs) were found, 62 men remained at risk of a diagnosis of PC. All men were offered repeat testing; 6 PCs were found in 20 men at rebiopsy. Men with at least 1 negative biopsy (n = 56) were invited to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and MRI-guided biopsies if indicated. Linkage to the Dutch Cancer Registry after 2.8 years of follow-up was performed for men with negative biopsies.Of the 56 men at risk, 28 agreed to participate in further testing. They were offered MRI studies; only 7 men agreed, and in 2, suspicious lesions were found and biopsies carried out. Only 1 PC was diagnosed and classified as T1c, Gleason 3 + 3 = 6. The overall findings of 3 rounds of testing and of linkage to the cancer registry show that eventually 35 PCs were detected in 90 men with PCA3 scores ?100 (positive predictive value 38.9%).Finding no PC despite extended diagnostic efforts in many men with initial PCA3 scores ?100 is unexpected and might be clinically relevant.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581524","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.781905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.770667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.644069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.610742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.596422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.520985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.357486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.267177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Cancer registry","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_registry"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Gleason Grading System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
