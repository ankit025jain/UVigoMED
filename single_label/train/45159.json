{"id":45159,"title":"High expression of zinc-binding protein-89 predicts decreased survival in esophageal squamous cell cancer.","abstract":"Zinc-binding protein-89 (ZBP-89), a Krüppel-type four-zinc finger transcription factor, is associated with many cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. It has been reported to be involved in several human cancers. However, ZBP-89 expression pattern and its clinical significance have not yet been investigated in esophageal squamous cell cancer.In this study, immunostaining was performed to detect ZBP-89 expression in esophageal squamous cell cancer, and then the correlations between ZBP-89 expression and both clinicopathologic variables and overall survival were analyzed.Compared with adjacent normal tissues, ZBP-89 expression was significantly upregulated in esophageal squamous cell cancer tissues. Increased ZBP-89 expression was associated with N category (p = 0.009) and TNM stage (p = 0.023). Patients with high expression of ZBP-89 demonstrated shortened overall survival compared with those with low expression of ZBP-89 (mean overall survival, 56.961 months versus 76.029 months; p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that ZBP-89 expression had a significant, independent predictive value for survival of esophageal squamous cell cancer (relative risk, 1.581; p = 0.024).Our data show that increased expression of ZBP-89 is associated with poor prognosis for esophageal squamous cell cancer patients and may act as a novel, useful, and independent prognostic indicator for esophageal squamous cell cancer. Further studies are warranted.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698505","annotations":[{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.747911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.727992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.698868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Relative risk","weight":0.690498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Transcription factor","weight":0.664772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.654271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.592413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.585077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.52408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.502215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.471845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.462436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.288941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.274684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.251262,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.19899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Esophagus","weight":0.16565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.147074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0672669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Proportional hazards models","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.0140385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"}]}
