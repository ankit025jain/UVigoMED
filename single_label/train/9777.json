{"id":9777,"title":"Gene detection, virus isolation, and sequence analysis of avian leukosis viruses in Taiwan country chickens.","abstract":"Avian leukosis virus (ALV) infection in Taiwan Country chickens (TCCs) was investigated by using gene detection, virus isolation, and sequence analysis. The blood samples of 61 TCC flocks at market ages from a slaughter house were screened for exogenous ALVs using polymerase chain reaction to investigate the ALV infection status. The buffy coats from three breeder and four commercial chicken flocks were cocultured with DF-1 cells to isolate the virus. The full proviral DNA genomes of two ALV isolates were sequenced, analyzed, and compared with reference ALV strains. The gene detection results showed that 60 and 43 of the 61 flocks were infected with subgroup A of ALV (ALV-A) and subgroup J of ALV (ALV-J), respectively. Virus isolation results showed that five ALV-As and two ALV-Js were isolated from those seven TCC flocks. The full sequences of the isolates showed that isolate TW-3577 possessed a myeloblastosis-associated virus 1 gp85 coding region and an ALV-J 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) and was similar to ordinary ALV-A. However, TW-3593 was unique. The 3'UTR of this isolate displayed high identity to endogenous counterpart sequence and its gp85 was different from all subgroups. This unique ALV is common in Taiwan.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24689170","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Avian sarcoma leukosis virus","weight":0.741171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_sarcoma_leukosis_virus"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Chicken","weight":0.660595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.536845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.507615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.446026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.445113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Coding region","weight":0.442427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region"},{"name":"Endogeny","weight":0.415729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeny"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.309714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Exogeny","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogeny"},{"name":"Slaughterhouse","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.154746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Animal slaughter","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_slaughter"},{"name":"Flock (birds)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(birds)"},{"name":"Plant breeding","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_breeding"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0184468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Country music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music"},{"name":"House music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music"},{"name":"Spirit possession","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_possession"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Solitude","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude"}]}
