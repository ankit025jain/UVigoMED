{"id":33576,"title":"Intracranial teratoma in children: the role of chromosome 21 trisomy.","abstract":"Teratomas are very rare intracranial tumors and cytogenetic information on this group remains rare. We report a case of a mature teratoma with abnormal +21 trisomy in tumor karyotype ocurring in a non-Down syndrome(DS) infant. Additionally, the evidence for the contribution of chromosome 21 trisomy in this neoplasia are briefly reviewed. The 6-month-old male baby presented with a posterior fossa tumor. Histological evaluation of tumor specimen showed a mature teratoma composed of fully differentiated ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal components. Although somatic karyotyping of the index case was normal, composite tumor karyotype depicted 47,XY,+21[6]/46,XY[6]. Besides previous reports of children with DS and intracranial teratomas, this is the first report to describe the occurrence of an isolated chromosome 21 trisomy within the tumor of a non-DS child. The participation of chromosome 21 in this rare pediatric tumor, either somatic or restricted to tumor specimen,may deserve special interest and further investigation.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812702","annotations":[{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Teratoma","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Chromosome 21 (human)","weight":0.766946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_21_(human)"},{"name":"Brain tumor","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.760949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.736231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Ectoderm","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.65285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.609428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Mesoderm","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoderm"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.473572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Endoderm","weight":0.46188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoderm"},{"name":"Posterior cranial fossa","weight":0.341192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cranial_fossa"},{"name":"XY sex-determination system","weight":0.292333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.162111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
