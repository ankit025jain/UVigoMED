{"id":88456,"title":"Physical training, with especial reference to the training of convalescents.","abstract":"Lieutenant-Colonel Netterville Barron, MVO RAMC, identified that although there was a moral and practical reason for providing training for convalescents, there lacked the scientific knowledge and structure to deliver it correctly. He should perhaps be considered the pioneer of rehabilitation within the military, with this paper providing the embryonic foundation from which the present DMRP has evolved. There is now very good science to support physical training and the delivery of rehabilitation, which now begins at the earliest time possible in the intensive care unit. From there, a robust structure of rehabilitation supports the patient back to duty or to the point of discharge. What has not altered is the seemingly never-ending debate about the provision of continued support (or lack of) after soldiers are finally discharged. Despite this fact, it is highly likely that Lt. Col Barron would be very satisfied with how far \"physical training, with especial reference to the training of convalescent\" has progressed.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24845887","annotations":[{"name":"Reason","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Military","weight":0.646869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.624904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Moral","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.479186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.410378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.397917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.219531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.157057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Soldier","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Convalescence","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convalescence"},{"name":"Royal Victorian Order","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order"},{"name":"Royal Army Medical Corps","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Army_Medical_Corps"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Practical reason","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_reason"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Foundation (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Battery (electricity)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Settler","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
