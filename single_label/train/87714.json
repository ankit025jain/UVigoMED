{"id":87714,"title":"Variability of tunnel positioning in ACL reconstruction.","abstract":"Since tunnel positioning is one of the key factors in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and the variability of tunnel positioning in ACL reconstruction has so far never been analyzed, the objective of this study was to determine the inter- and intra-observer variability of tibial and femoral tunnel positioning in ACL reconstruction.In an operating room setup, 13 surgeons were asked to identify the tunnel positions in one and the same ACL-deficient cadaver knee. Using a fluoroscopic based ACL navigation system, tunnel positions were digitally measured in a test/re-test scenario. For variability analysis mean positions, standard deviations and range were calculated as well as differences between test/re-test positions.The intraobserver analysis showed a tibial variability of 3.3 mm (SD 2.1, range 7.5 mm) and a femoral variability of 2.0 mm (SD 1.6 mm, range 6.8 mm). The interobserver variability of the tibial tunnel positions was 3.2 mm (SD) with a range of 18.3 mm and a femoral variability of 3.7 mm (SD) with a range of 13.2 mm.This study demonstrates that a reasonable inter- and intra-observer variability in ACL tunnel positioning exists even among experienced surgeons. Although deviations of 2-3 mm may seem to be acceptable at first sight, a range of up to 18.3 mm indicates that outliers exist, which can cause graft failure. More reliable reconstruction techniques should be developed to reduce the variability in tunnel positioning.","date":"2014-09-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005314","annotations":[{"name":"Femur","weight":0.693938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.689429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.668607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.514156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Tibia","weight":0.371901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.356382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.315577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Cruciate ligament","weight":0.0522101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","weight":0.0477563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_reconstruction"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Navigation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Scenario","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Tunnel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel"},{"name":"Outlier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Music download","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_download"},{"name":"7 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_mm_caliber"},{"name":"6 mm caliber","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_mm_caliber"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"7.5x54mm French","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.5x54mm_French"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Butterfly Bomb","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_Bomb"},{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"California's 1st State Senate district","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_1st_State_Senate_district"}]}
