{"id":68371,"title":"Adoptive transfer of bone marrow dendritic cells failed to localize in the renal cortex and to improve renal injury in adriamycin nephropathy.","abstract":"Murine bone marrow (BM) dendritic cells (DCs) can be modulated to be tolerogenic by cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-?, and may play a regulatory role and sustain immune hemostasis in cognate kidney disease. However, it is unknown whether BM-DCs can be used to protect against renal injury in murine Adriamycin nephropathy (AN).In this study, by adoptive in vivo transfer of BM-DCs, including immature DCs, mature DCs (lipopolysaccharide-stimulated DCs) and BM regulatory DCs (IL-10/TGF-?-modified DCs, DCregs), we addressed the potential benefits of BM-DCs in chronic kidney disease.We found that after adoptive transfer of DCregs, renal injury, including glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, was not changed compared to AN controls. Correspondingly, renal functions measured by serum creatinine, 12-hour urine protein and creatinine clearance were also not improved by transfusion with DCregs compared to AN controls.This study showed that the adoptive transfer of BM-DCs was unable to improve renal injury in an AN model, and this failure related to their inability to access the kidney.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526139","annotations":[{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.860107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chronic kidney disease","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_kidney_disease"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.814008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.802769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Blood transfusion","weight":0.735017,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Atrophy","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.703787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.620188,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.511326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.502616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.477288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.471614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.382072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"Transforming growth factor","weight":0.284785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforming_growth_factor"},{"name":"Clearance (medicine)","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearance_(medicine)"},{"name":"Renal cortex","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cortex"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.0512665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Renal tubule","weight":0.0376635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_tubule"},{"name":"Cognate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
