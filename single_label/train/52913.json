{"id":52913,"title":"Molecular correlates of platinum response in human high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient-derived xenografts.","abstract":"Improvement in the ability to target underlying drivers and vulnerabilities of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC) requires the development of molecularly annotated pre-clinical models reflective of clinical responses.We generated patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from consecutive, chemotherapy-na√Øve, human HG-SOC by transplanting fresh human HG-SOC fragments into subcutaneous and intra-ovarian bursal sites of NOD/SCID IL2R?(null) recipient mice, completed molecular annotation and assessed platinum sensitivity.The success rate of xenografting was 83%. Of ten HG-SOC PDXs, all contained mutations in TP53, two were mutated for BRCA1, three for BRCA2, and in two, BRCA1 was methylated. In vivo cisplatin response, determined as platinum sensitive (progression-free interval ? 100 d, n = 4), resistant (progression-free interval <100 d, n = 3) or refractory (n = 3), was largely consistent with patient outcome. Three of four platinum sensitive HG-SOC PDXs contained DNA repair gene mutations, and the fourth was methylated for BRCA1. In contrast, all three platinum refractory PDXs overexpressed dominant oncogenes (CCNE1, LIN28B and/or BCL2).Because PDX platinum response reflected clinical outcome, these annotated PDXs will provide a unique model system for preclinical testing of novel therapies for HG-SOC.","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24560445","annotations":[{"name":"Cisplatin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"BRCA2","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA2"},{"name":"BRCA1","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"DNA repair","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.816363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Methylation","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylation"},{"name":"Interleukin 2","weight":0.764178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_2"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.653936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Bcl-2","weight":0.639877,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.563904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.466967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Medical research","weight":0.45135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.424864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.386358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"BRCA mutation","weight":0.312663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA_mutation"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.282513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.259539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Annotation","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.17032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Serous fluid","weight":0.115424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serous_fluid"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.0794981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Molecular phylogenetics","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogenetics"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Platinum","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"}]}
