{"id":29668,"title":"When you see it, let it be: Urgency, mindfulness and adolescent substance use.","abstract":"The emotion-based domains of impulsivity, positive and negative urgency, are facets that have garnered attention due to their associations with substance use, and mindfulness based strategies have shown promise in reducing substance use in adults. The aim of the current study was to examine relations among urgency, mindfulness, and substance use in adolescence. Cross-sectional data were collected from students (N=1,051) at a large, private high school in the Pacific Northwest. Both positive and negative urgency were uniquely associated with greater likelihood of lifetime and current alcohol use; only positive urgency predicted lifetime marijuana use. Mindfulness was associated with a lower likelihood of lifetime alcohol or marijuana use. Interactions between urgency and mindfulness were not supported. Our findings highlight the need to explore relations among baseline mindfulness, skills based mindfulness, and personality in adolescent alcohol and other drug use.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629324","annotations":[{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Cannabis (drug)","weight":0.732498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.613683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pacific Northwest","weight":0.442177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.339783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"School","weight":0.23476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Impulsivity","weight":0.108867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulsivity"},{"name":"Personality psychology","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0656348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0412312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Pacific Ocean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Mindfulness","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Facet (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facet_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Urinary urgency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_urgency"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Domain name","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"},{"name":"Nonprofit organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization"},{"name":"Interactions (The Spectacular Spider-Man)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactions_(The_Spectacular_Spider-Man)"},{"name":"Reducing sugar","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_sugar"}]}
