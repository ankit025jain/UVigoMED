{"id":53773,"title":"BMI-associated alleles do not constitute risk alleles for polycystic ovary syndrome independently of BMI: a case-control study.","abstract":"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) has a strong genetic background and the majority of patients with PCOS have elevated BMI levels. The aim of this study was to determine to which extent BMI-increasing alleles contribute to risk of PCOS when contemporaneous BMI is taken into consideration.Patients with PCOS and controls were recruited from the United Kingdom (563 cases and 791 controls) and The Netherlands (510 cases and 2720 controls). Cases and controls were of similar BMI. SNPs mapping to 12 BMI-associated loci which have been extensively replicated across different ethnicities, i.e., BDNF, FAIM2, ETV5, FTO, GNPDA2, KCTD15, MC4R, MTCH2, NEGR1, SEC16B, SH2B1, and TMEM18, were studied in association with PCOS within each cohort using the additive genetic model followed by a combined analysis. A genetic allelic count risk score model was used to determine the risk of PCOS for individuals carrying increasing numbers of BMI-increasing alleles.None of the genetic variants, including FTO and MC4R, was associated with PCOS independently of BMI in the meta-analysis. Moreover, no differences were observed between cases and controls in the number of BMI-risk alleles present and no overall trend across the risk score groups was observed.In this combined analysis of over 4,000 BMI-matched individuals from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, we observed no association of BMI risk alleles with PCOS independent of BMI.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498077","annotations":[{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor","weight":0.714882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.628741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.604587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.604317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.456425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.450903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.291886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.21349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Ethnic group","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0589687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Melanocortin 4 receptor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_4_receptor"},{"name":"SH2B1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SH2B1"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Food additive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"791","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/791"},{"name":"Thiol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiol"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Second baseman","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman"},{"name":"Omid 16B","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omid_16B"},{"name":"FTO gene","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTO_gene"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"SH2 domain","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SH2_domain"},{"name":"Military Cross","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Cross"},{"name":"Eesti Televisioon","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eesti_Televisioon"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Southeastern Conference","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference"}]}
