{"id":66102,"title":"Efficacy and safety of local steroids for urethra strictures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","abstract":"Local steroids have been used as an adjuvant therapy to patients undergoing internal urethrotomy (IU) in treating urethral strictures. Whether this technique is effective and safe is still controversial. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of local steroids as applied with the IU procedure.A systematic review of the literature was performed by searching Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library Databases, and the Web of Science. We included only prospective randomized, controlled trials that compared the efficacy and safety between IU procedures with applied local steroids and those without.Eight studies were found eligible for further analysis. In total, 203 patients undergoing IU were treated with steroid injection or catheter lubrication. Time to recurrence is statistically significant (mean: 10.14 and 5.07 months, P<0.00001).The number of patients with recurrent stricture formation significantly decreased at different follow-up time points (P=0.05).No statistically significant differences were found between the recurrence rates, adverse effects, and success rates of second IUs in patients with applied local steroids and those without.The use of local steroids with IU seems to prolong time to stricture recurrence but does not seem to affect the high stricture recurrence rate following IU. When local steroids are applied with complementary intention, the disease control outcomes are encouraging. Further robust comparative effectiveness studies are now required.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24745607","annotations":[{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.799291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Urethra","weight":0.797663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.77724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.76011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.70665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.697526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.652406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.605027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.484469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.446141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.409879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.380046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.358191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.221624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.154944,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.154334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Web of Science","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science"},{"name":"International unit","weight":0.0184033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"World Wide Web","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"},{"name":"Urethral stricture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Vaginal lubrication","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_lubrication"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"}]}
