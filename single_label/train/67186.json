{"id":67186,"title":"High expression of MICA in human kidney cancer tissue and renal cell carcinoma lines.","abstract":"The overall incidence and mortality of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common kidney cancer, are steadily increasing for reasons that are not fully explained. Our aim was to explore the expression of membrane MHC class I chain-related gene A (mMICA) in human RCC cell lines and tissue specimens, and to determine expression of soluble MICA (sMICA) in serum of patients with renal cell carcinoma, we used flow cytometry (FCM) and immunohistochemistry as well as an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) . The results showed that percentage of mMICA expression was significantly increased in human kidney cancer tissues and RCC cell lines (786-O and Ketr-3) than that in healthy adults and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line individuality (P<0.05). sMICA content in healthy adults was negative, but in renal cancer patients was significantly elevated (P<0.05). Our research showed that high expression of MICA in human kidney cancer, this results show that MICA might serve as potential tumor-associated antigen (TAA) in RCC.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641397","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Major histocompatibility complex","weight":0.872586,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"MHC class I","weight":0.769106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHC_class_I"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Solubility","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.639969,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.632087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.617761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.442862,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.404215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.125636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"HEK cell","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEK_cell"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
