{"id":22882,"title":"Actinomyces infection appearing five years after trocar-guided transvaginal mesh prolapse repair.","abstract":"Bacterial colonization and chronic infection following mesh-augmented pelvic floor reconstructive surgery may be one reason for abnormal healing and the occurrence of complications such as a mesh erosion, pain, and shrinkage. This case presents a patient with Actinomyces infection that appeared 5Â years after trocar-guided transvaginal mesh repair of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). In patients with recurrent symptomatic mesh exposure, if partial removal or conservative treatment is unsuccessful, the possibility of Actinomyces infection should be considered.
