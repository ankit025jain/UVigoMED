{"id":80964,"title":"[Views for research development of control of parasitic diseases].","abstract":"With the social and technological development, new understandings have been emerged for the research development of the control of parasitic diseases. The present review argues that: the traditional point of view for the control of parasitic diseases, eliminating parasites/media, should be updated. For the long-term interests of science and human perspective, biological diversity, including the parasite biodiversity, and ecological environment should be paid much more attention during the control of parasitic diseases. The leading role of society, economy and culture should be fully developed in the control of parasitic diseases with the progress of scientific and technology, to find a final way of sustainable development in the control of parasitic diseases.","date":"2014-02-04","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490386","annotations":[{"name":"Ecology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Sustainable development","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development"},{"name":"Biodiversity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.726557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.6654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.663049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.343527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"City","weight":0.210101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Science and technology","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0298055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Perspective (cognitive)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)"}]}
