{"id":16585,"title":"Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Burkholderia pseudomallei among melioidosis cases in Kedah, Malaysia.","abstract":"Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality particularly among diabetics. We evaluated 228 isolates of B. pseudomallei for antimicrobial sensitivity during 2005-2010 using the disc diffusion technique, of which 144 were obtained from blood culture. More than 90% of the strains were susceptible to cefoperazone, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol and imipenem. Eighty-two percent of the isolates were susceptible to tetracycline and amoxicillin/clavulanate. The susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin was 78% and to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxezole was 47%. The susceptibilities to aminoglycoside antibiotics were low (21% to gentamicin and 6% to amikacin). The susceptibilities were similar between isolates from females and males, bacteremic and abacteremic cases, diabetics and non-diabetics, pneumonia and non-pneumonia cases and between those who died and those who survived. Our findings show antibiotic susceptibility patterns are not a major factor in determining outcomes of B. pseudomallei infection. Monitoring the drug susceptibilities among B. pseudomallei isolates needs to be conducted regularly to guide empiric therapy for melioidosis, as it causes high mortality, especially among diabetic cases.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974653","annotations":[{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Chloramphenicol","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloramphenicol"},{"name":"Blood culture","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_culture"},{"name":"Tetracycline","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline"},{"name":"Imipenem","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imipenem"},{"name":"Ciprofloxacin","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"},{"name":"Amikacin","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amikacin"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Aminoglycoside","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycoside"},{"name":"Ceftazidime","weight":0.80973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceftazidime"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Burkholderia pseudomallei","weight":0.800593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkholderia_pseudomallei"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.782496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Cefoperazone","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefoperazone"},{"name":"Empiric therapy","weight":0.731492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiric_therapy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Burkholderia","weight":0.485902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkholderia"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.48201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.382676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Minimum inhibitory concentration","weight":0.319377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Melioidosis","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melioidosis"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.0471213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Empirical","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical"},{"name":"Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby-Bauer_antibiotic_testing"}]}
