{"id":31074,"title":"Hepatoprotective action of Echinophora platyloba DC leaves against acute toxicity of acetaminophen in rats.","abstract":"Acetaminophen, an analgesic and antipyretic drug, causes fulminant hepatic injury at high doses.This study evaluated the effects of Echinophora platyloba extract on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Forty-eight rats were divided into six groups. The first (control) and second (test without treatment) groups were administered the solvent of the drug in the morning (08:00) and evening (16:00) on days 1 and 2 but, the third, fourth, and fifth groups received 200, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg b.w E. platyloba extract by gavage on the same days, respectively. The sixth group (positive control) received 200 mg/kg b.w silymarin. Then all groups, except the control group, received 400 mg/kg acetaminophen by gavage on day 2 (10:00). After 24 hr, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), malondialdehyde (MDA), and antioxidant capacity plus liver catalase (CAT) activity and histopathological studies were determined. Data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).Treatment of rats with different doses of E. platyloba extract significantly reduced (p < .05) the elevated serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and MDA compared to the untreated group. The effects of 1,000 mg/kg E. platyloba were similar to the control and treated silymarin groups. Moreover, E. platyloba significantly increased the activity of liver CAT and serum antioxidant capacity at different doses. Also, E. platyloba extract improved liver histopathological changes compared with the respective control group.The results suggest that E. platyloba extract has impressive hepatoprotective effects on acute acetaminophen-induced liver injuries.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24409975","annotations":[{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.877087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Catalase","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalase"},{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Alkaline phosphatase","weight":0.846848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_phosphatase"},{"name":"Paracetamol","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.834954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.806963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Antipyretic","weight":0.789357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipyretic"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.746945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Solvent","weight":0.724201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"},{"name":"Alkalinity","weight":0.598879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkalinity"},{"name":"Transaminase","weight":0.569061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.536523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.532539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Malondialdehyde","weight":0.521924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malondialdehyde"},{"name":"Aspartic acid","weight":0.516808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid"},{"name":"Hepatoprotection","weight":0.512908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatoprotection"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.50046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.498115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Alanine","weight":0.486616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine"},{"name":"Silibinin","weight":0.317002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silibinin"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Phosphatase","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatase"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Feeding tube","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_radical_absorbance_capacity"},{"name":"Fulminant","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant"}]}
