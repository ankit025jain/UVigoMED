{"id":32294,"title":"Treatment of camptodactyly using injection of botulinum neurotoxin.","abstract":"Camptodactyly is usually painless, not caused by trauma, often appearing bilaterally, gradually progressive flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint mainly on the 5th fingers.The aim of the study was to analyze the efficacy injecting botulinum neurotoxin in short muscles of the hand responsible for the contraction of the proximal interphalangeal joint.The clinical material consisted of 12 patients (8 women, 4 men) treated with injections of botulinum neurotoxin in 2009-2012. Patients were monitored respectively for 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months and then every six months after the procedure. The observation period after injection of toxin ranged from 18 to 36 months. Our proposed method of treatment is inducing a temporary paralysis of muscles (lumbrical, interosseous) by means of botulinum neurotoxin (Botox).In the majority (10) of patients an improvement and stabilization was achieved just after one injection and there were no disease progression in subsequent controlled studies. These patients continued treatment with usage of redressing extensive splints. In case of the other two patients it was required to repeat the injections.The preliminary results obtained are promising. This method of treatment requires further studies and long-term follow-ups every six months until release of symptoms of the disease will be achieved. The operative treatment is reserved for severe deformities.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24979511","annotations":[{"name":"Botulinum toxin","weight":0.851266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Neurotoxin","weight":0.81519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxin"},{"name":"Contracture","weight":0.77432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.725075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.723608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.716376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.700396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.689867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.586964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Muscle contraction","weight":0.446431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.417882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Interphalangeal articulations of hand","weight":0.243284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphalangeal_articulations_of_hand"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Scientific method","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"},{"name":"Splint (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)"},{"name":"Camptodactyly","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camptodactyly"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Interosseous sacroiliac ligament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interosseous_sacroiliac_ligament"},{"name":"Human anatomical terms","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
