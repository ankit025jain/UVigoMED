{"id":52285,"title":"Complete phenotypic and metabolic profiles of a large consecutive cohort of untreated Korean women with polycystic ovary syndrome.","abstract":"To investigate the complete metabolic and phenotypic profiles of a large cohort of untreated, consecutively recruited Korean women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), for whom a registry for Korean women with PCOS was constructed.Observational study.Three infertility clinics and 10 university hospitals.Eight hundred sixty-five women with PCOS were recruited using the Rotterdam criteria.Standardized evaluation protocol and web-based case report form.Metabolic and phenotypic profiles.The subjects with PCOS mainly consisted of young and nonobese women. The most problematic subjective symptom was menstrual disturbance or infertility, and, on average, the patients seemed to menstruate every 2 months. PCO morphology was observed in 96.5% of the patients. Although few women visited hospitals owing to HA symptoms alone, hirsutism was observed in one-third of the patients (33.9%) and half (47.4%) of the patients had biochemical HA. About one-fifth (20.1%) of the patients had generalized obesity, and one-third (33.2%) had central obesity. Prevalence of dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome were 35.7%, 3.5%, 4.0%, and 13.7%, respectively. Prevalence of prediabetes was 20.8%, and a substantial proportion of additional subjects with normal fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance tests were identified as having prediabetes by hemoglobin A1C testing.Our well-defined cohort provided comprehensive estimates of the features of metabolic and phenotypic profiles related to PCOS in Korean women. Further longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to investigate the changes in phenotypic and metabolic markers in this PCOS cohort.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Endocrine System
