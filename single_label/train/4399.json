{"id":4399,"title":"[Assessment of schistosomiasis endemic situation in national surveillance sites in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2010].","abstract":"To assess the schistosomiasis endemic situation in the national surveillance sites in Hubei Province, so as to provide the evidence for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis.According to the national surveillance protocol, a longitudinal surveillance of endemic situation of schistosomiasis was carried out in 16 national surveillance sites from 2005 to 2010.In general, the positive rates of IHA, Kato-Katz technique and infection rates of Schistosoma japonicum decreased from 15.67%, 10.93% and 1.71% in 2005 to 10.48%, 8.54% and 0.90% in 2010, and declined by 33.12%, 22.70% and 47.95%, respectively. The infection rates of S. japonicum of the male were higher than that of the female, and the peak infection rates were in the groups aged above 30 years. The endemic situation of fishermen and farmers were relatively serious. The infection rates of S. japonicum in cattle decreased from 11.69% in 2005 to 1.41% in 2010, and declined by 88.01% (?2 = 298.79, P < 0.001). The areas with infected Oncomelania hupensis snails, the densities of living snails, the rates of infected snails and the densities of infected snails decreased by 90.88%, 61.66%, 80.00% and 92.00%, respectively.The schistosomiasis endemic situation in the national surveillance sites in Hubei Province mitigates in 6 years, but the prevention is still a very daunting task.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345149","annotations":[{"name":"Schistosomiasis","weight":0.89825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis"},{"name":"Endemism","weight":0.668902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.666623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Oncomelania","weight":0.652693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania"},{"name":"Schistosoma japonicum","weight":0.646232,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma_japonicum"},{"name":"Cattle","weight":0.521577,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.272668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.272668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Snail","weight":0.224804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snail"},{"name":"Schistosoma","weight":0.189675,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosoma"},{"name":"Farmer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Fisherman","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman"},{"name":"Hubei","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei"},{"name":"Oncomelania hupensis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncomelania_hupensis"},{"name":"Treaty","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty"},{"name":"1969","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Mountain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain"},{"name":"298","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/298"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Imperial Household Agency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Household_Agency"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
