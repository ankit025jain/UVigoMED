{"id":69086,"title":"Does fesoterodine have a role in the treatment of poorly managed patients with overactive bladder?","abstract":"Overactive bladder (OAB), a clinically defined symptom complex comprising urinary urgency, usually accompanied by urinary frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency incontinence, is common and has a markedly negative impact on the sufferer's quality of life. Following conservative and lifestyle management, the current pharmacological mainstay of treatment is antimuscarinic therapy. This review explores the role of fesoterodine, a relatively recently introduced antimuscarinic agent, in the treatment of patients who may have had a suboptimal response to initial therapy, who have switched treatment from tolterodine, or may be at risk of receiving poor treatment because of either multimorbidity or complex polypharmacy.
