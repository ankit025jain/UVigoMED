{"id":44939,"title":"Gastric feeding and \"gut rousing\" in acute pancreatitis.","abstract":"The \"pancreatic rest\" concept is entrenched in the management of acute pancreatitis. As a result, \"nonstimulatory\" feeding has been widely advocated in patients with this disease, being parenteral nutrition 2-3 decades ago and jejunal tube feeding in the past decade. However, accumulating clinical evidence from the fields of acute pancreatitis and critical care medicine suggests that gastric feeding is as safe and effective as jejunal feeding in most patients. This has paved the way for a new conceptual framework called \"gut rousing.\" Acute pancreatitis management now requires consideration of gut function. Enteral nutrition is a gut-directed therapy, and avoiding stimulation of the pancreas in patients with acute pancreatitis need not overshadow the main goal of maintaining or restoring gut function.
