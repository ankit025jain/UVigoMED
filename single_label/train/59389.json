{"id":59389,"title":"Evaluation of a new APTIMA specimen collection and transportation kit for high-risk human papillomavirus E6/E7 messenger RNA in cervical and vaginal samples.","abstract":"An APTIMA specimen collection and transportation (SCT) kit was developed by Hologic/Gen-Probe.To compare cervical SCT samples to PreservCyt and SurePath samples and self-collected vaginal samples to physician-collected vaginal and cervical SCT samples. To determine ease and comfort of self-collection with the kit.Each woman (n = 580) self-collected a vaginal SCT, then filled out a questionnaire (n = 563) to determine ease and comfort of self-collection. Colposcopy physicians collected a vaginal SCT and cervical PreservCyt, SCT, and SurePath samples. Samples were tested by APTIMA HPV (AHPV) assay.Agreement between testing of cervical SCT and PreservCyt was 91.1% (? = 0.82), and that of SurePath samples was 86.7% (? = 0.72). Agreement of self-collected vaginal SCT to physician-collected SCT was 84.7% (? = 0.68), and that of self-collected vaginal to cervical SCT was 82.0% (? = 0.63). For 30 patients with CIN2+, AHPV testing of cervical SCT was 100% sensitive and 59.8% specific compared with PreservCyt (96.6% and 66.2%) and SurePath (93.3% and 70.9%). Vaginal SCT sensitivity was 86.7% for self-collection and 80.0% for physician collection. Most patients found that vaginal self-collection was easy, 5.3% reported some difficulty, and 87.6% expressed no discomfort.Cervical samples collected with the new SCT kit compared well to traditional liquid-based samples tested by AHPV. Although there was good agreement between self-collected and physician-collected samples with the SCT, in a limited number of 30 women, vaginal sampling identified fewer with CIN2+ precancerous cervical lesions than cervical SCT sampling. Comfort, ease of use, and detection of high-risk HPV demonstrated that the kit could be used for cervical and vaginal sampling.","date":"2014-05-14","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825332","annotations":[{"name":"Human papillomavirus","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus"},{"name":"Colposcopy","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colposcopy"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.709475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Papillomaviridae","weight":0.675714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillomaviridae"},{"name":"Precancerous condition","weight":0.636988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precancerous_condition"},{"name":"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia","weight":0.588347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_intraepithelial_neoplasia"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.428827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.422709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.360237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"580","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/580"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Courier","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier"},{"name":"Transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"E6","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E6"},{"name":"Comfort, Texas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort,_Texas"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Usability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"}]}
