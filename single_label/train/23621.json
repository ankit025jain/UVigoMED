{"id":23621,"title":"Real-time PCR assay for detection of blaZ genes in Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates.","abstract":"The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommends consideration of blaZ gene testing for cases of serious Staphylococcus aureus infection. Conventional PCR methods have demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity to phenotypic tests. To our knowledge, this is the first description of real-time PCR detection of the blaZ gene.
