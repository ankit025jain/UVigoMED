{"id":90109,"title":"Down but not out: incidence and estimated costs to society of road casualties in Strathclyde, Scotland.","abstract":"To investigate the recent epidemiological patterns and costs of road traffic casualties (RTCs) in Strathclyde, Scotland.Retrospective record-linkage epidemiological study using routine data sources.A linked police-hospital database was analysed to describe the epidemiology of RTCs from 2004 to 2009. Using UK government methodology, the costs of road casualties to the National Health Service (NHS) and society were assessed.RTC rates declined over the study period. Males were at higher risk than females as were those residing in more socially deprived addresses. The estimated costs of RTCs in Strathclyde amounted to £400 million annually. Of this, around one twentieth (£20 million per year), was attributable to direct NHS costs.Road casualties remain a major public health threat in Strathclyde, and contribute to health inequalities. RTC costs to society amount to almost a tenth of NHS revenue expenditure. Cost-effective road safety measures should be deployed more widely.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650593","annotations":[{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.906545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Scotland","weight":0.743385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.738699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.569488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Road traffic safety","weight":0.551852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.544047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.541259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Health equity","weight":0.336089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity"},{"name":"Road","weight":0.322485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road"},{"name":"Government of the United Kingdom","weight":0.286474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Traffic collision","weight":0.224431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.17501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.174844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0814775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Revenue","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Traffic","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Reported Road Casualties Great Britain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reported_Road_Casualties_Great_Britain"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Economic inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"},{"name":"Casualty (person)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person)"},{"name":"Strathclyde","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathclyde"}]}
