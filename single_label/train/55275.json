{"id":55275,"title":"A prospective randomized clinical evaluation of 3 presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses after cataract extraction.","abstract":"To compare contrast sensitivity, visual acuity (VA), and halos in subjects bilaterally implanted with 1 of 3 FDA-approved presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses.Prospective, randomized, partially masked, multicenter clinical trial.Seventy-eight subjects were randomized sequentially for bilateral implantation with the Crystalens AO (Bausch & Lomb Surgical), AcrySof IQ ReSTOR +3.0 (Alcon Laboratories), or Tecnis Multifocal (Abbott Medical Optics) lenses. Subjects were evaluated through visit 4 (4 to 6 months after surgery) with the following monocular and binocular assessments: high- and low-contrast VA, contrast sensitivity without glare, halos or starbursts, defocus curves, optical scatter, retinal point spread function, and safety.The Crystalens AO and ReSTOR +3.0 demonstrated better monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity without glare at low to mid spatial frequencies compared with the Tecnis Multifocal lens. Binocular uncorrected distance VA was not significantly different between the 3 lenses. The Crystalens AO had significantly better binocular low-contrast distance-corrected VA than the ReSTOR +3.0 and better mean monocular low-contrast DCVA than the Tecnis Multifocal lens. The Crystalens AO demonstrated significantly better monocular and binocular uncorrected and distance-corrected intermediate VA than the ReSTOR +3.0 or Tecnis Multifocal lenses. The ReSTOR+3.0 lens had significantly better monocular and binocular uncorrected and distance-corrected near VA tested at 40 cm compared with the Crystalens AO and Tecnis Multifocal lens. The Crystalens AO elicited significantly less halos than the Tecnis Multifocal lens and less optical scatter than the ReSTOR +3.0 or Tecnis Multifocal lens.The Crystalens AO had statistically better uncorrected intermediate VA and distance-corrected intermediate VA than the ReSTOR +3.0 or Tecnis Multifocal lenses and fewer photic phenomenon than the Tecnis Multifocal lens. Both multifocals had better distance-corrected near VA and uncorrected near VA than the Crystalens AO. These findings may guide intraocular lens selection for individual patients seeking to optimize vision at specific vergences or lighting conditions.","date":"2014-08-18","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24932989","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Contrast (vision)","weight":0.786225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.745103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.716222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Scattering","weight":0.714906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.714662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Visual acuity","weight":0.710976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity"},{"name":"Optics","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.687614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.685739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Binocular vision","weight":0.673071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.630639,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.595153,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Lighting","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting"},{"name":"Point spread function","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function"},{"name":"Spatial frequency","weight":0.302615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_frequency"},{"name":"Intelligence quotient","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"},{"name":"Barometer","weight":0.248859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer"},{"name":"Defocus aberration","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defocus_aberration"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.218394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Monocular","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocular"},{"name":"Glare (vision)","weight":0.189214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glare_(vision)"},{"name":"Halo (optical phenomenon)","weight":0.14452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon)"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.110374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Alcon","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcon"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"},{"name":"Virginia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"},{"name":"Photic zone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_zone"},{"name":"Stimulus (physiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"}]}
