{"id":53836,"title":"Diffusion-weighted imaging of ovarian torsion: usefulness of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for the detection of hemorrhagic infarction.","abstract":"We undertook this study to evaluate the need for diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in detecting hemorrhagic infarction following ovarian torsion.The study included 14 consecutive patients aged 12 to 74 years (average age, 36 years) with surgical confirmation of ovarian torsion who underwent 1.5-tesla MR imaging. Pathologically, hemorrhagic infarction was found in 7 patients. We retrospectively reviewed signal intensity on T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in swollen ovarian stroma.Fallopian tube thickening was seen in all patients. In patients with ovarian cystic lesion, maximum cyst wall thickness was significantly higher in patients with hemorrhagic infarction (mean, 13.5 ± 4.1 mm) than those without (mean, 5.0 ± 1.0 mm) (P < .05). Signal intensity did not differ significantly on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and DW images between patients with and without hemorrhagic infarction. ADCs were significantly lower in patients with hemorrhagic infarction (1.20 ± 0.50 [× 10(-3) mm(2)/s]) than those without (2.04 ± 0.26 [× 10(-3) mm(2)/s]) (P < .01). With an ADC threshold of 1.80 [× 10(-3) mm(2)/s], sensitivity for hemorrhagic infarction was 0.88 (7 of 8), and specificity was 1.00 (6 of 6).ADC measurements were useful for detecting hemorrhagic infarction in patients with ovarian torsion.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492742","annotations":[{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.876747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.771238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.609736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.584483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.534841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.512807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.47087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.427604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Tesla (unit)","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.334742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.297256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.213444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.193233,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Brownian motion","weight":0.116055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Ovarian torsion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_torsion"},{"name":"Analog-to-digital converter","weight":0.027714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Second","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second"},{"name":"Intensity (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_(physics)"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Weight function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function"},{"name":"Thickening","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening"},{"name":"Drum Workshop","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_Workshop"},{"name":"Torsion (mechanics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(mechanics)"},{"name":"Intima-media thickness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intima-media_thickness"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Confirmation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"The New Era","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Era"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
