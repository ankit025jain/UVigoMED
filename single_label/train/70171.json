{"id":70171,"title":"Vismodegib in the treatment of advanced BCC.","abstract":"Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy, comprising over 80 per thousand of non-melanoma skin cancers. Surgical excision is adequate treatment for most BCC's. Options are however limited for the minority of patients presenting with locally advanced inoperable or metastatic BCC. The Hedgehog signalling pathway is a critical driver in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and hereditary BCC. On 31st January 2012, based on a phase II clinical trial the US Food and Drug Administration approved Vismodegib (Erivedge, Roche) a first-in-class, small-molecule oral Hedgehog-inhibitor for the treatment of locally advanced inoperable and metastatic BCC. We present our experience treating the first Irish patient with this agent.","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25226719","annotations":[{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.793949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.659764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.419367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.378888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.270433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Ireland","weight":0.211916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Vismodegib","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vismodegib"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Cubic crystal system","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"January 31","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_31"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Hedgehog signaling pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog_signaling_pathway"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Hoffmann-La Roche","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche"},{"name":"Auto racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"}]}
