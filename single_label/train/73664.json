{"id":73664,"title":"Photoimmunology.","abstract":"The discipline that investigates the biologic effects of ultraviolet radiation on the immune system is called photoimmunology. Photoimmunology evolved from an interest in understanding the role of the immune system in skin cancer development and why immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients are at a greatly increased risk for cutaneous neoplasms. In addition to contributing to an understanding of the pathogenesis of nonmelanoma skin cancer, the knowledge acquired about the immunologic effects of ultraviolet radiation exposure has provided an understanding of its role in the pathogenesis of other photodermatologic diseases.
