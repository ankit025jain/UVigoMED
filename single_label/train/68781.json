{"id":68781,"title":"Effect of different hemodialyzers on serum levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10 and interleukin-18.","abstract":"The blood and membrane contact during dialysis may elicit an immune reaction. The current study looked at the impact of different dialyzers on blood levels of cytokines.During the first month, randomly selected patients were treated with one dialyzer (PF-170H) and then crossed over to another dialyzer (FLX-18GW) during the next month. Pre- and postdialysis blood samples were assayed for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and IL-18.A significant drop of postdialysis systolic blood pressure (pre vs. post 156.4 ± 31.8 vs. 143.1 ± 24.8 mm Hg, p = 0.014) and diastolic pressure (80.7 ± 12.7 vs. 73.4 ± 10.9 mm Hg, p = 0.002) were found when patients were dialyzed with PF-170H. A significant increase of postdialysis IL-18 levels was found in both groups (pre vs. post 605.5 ± 278.6 vs. 690.6 ± 315.3 pg/ml, p = 0.016, for PF-170H and 556.4 ± 231.0 vs. 647.3 ± 282.6 pg/ml, p = 0.067, for FLX-18GW). There was a positive correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 levels (p < 0.0001).We demonstrated a significant increase of postdialysis serum IL-18 level when either dialyzer was used. There is a strong correlation between serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496202","annotations":[{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.792192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.695426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.678312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.660498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.631481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.587523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.565672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.563323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.552466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.524779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.273685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.114493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Interleukin 10","weight":0.0989124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_10"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Interleukin 18","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_18"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"647","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/647"},{"name":"690","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/690"},{"name":"278","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/278"},{"name":"8 mm film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_mm_film"},{"name":"315","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/315"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Dialysis (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Crossover (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(music)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Watt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt"},{"name":"Metallurgical assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_assay"}]}
