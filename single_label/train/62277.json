{"id":62277,"title":"[Ibrutinib in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other B-cell malignancies].","abstract":"Survival and progression of patients with mature B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, depend on signals from the B -cell receptor, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase(BTK) is a critical signaling kinase in this pathway. Ibrutinib is a novel and selective inhibitor of BTK, inactivating the kinase irreversibly. It has shown exciting results in early clinical trials. In this review, the application and molecular mechanism of Ibrutinib in the treatment of B-cell malignancies are discussed.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598688","annotations":[{"name":"B cell","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell"},{"name":"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia","weight":0.84873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.837652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.751055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.680572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.438258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"B-cell receptor","weight":0.388887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-cell_receptor"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.312202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.253863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Functional selectivity","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity"},{"name":"Lymphoid leukemia","weight":0.0224886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_leukemia"},{"name":"Irreversible process","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
