{"id":60681,"title":"Paediatric giant cervicomediastinal thymolipoma.","abstract":"We report a case of a 11-year-old boy who presented with a massive soft tissue right cervical painless and progressive lesion displacing trachea to the left and extending into the anteriosuperior mediastinum which was diagnosed to be a lipomatous mass on chest CT scan. Subsequent biopsy and total excision proved it to be a giant cervicomediastinal thymolipoma. It was successfully excised with excellent prognosis and long-term results. A giant paediatric cervicomediastinal thymolipoma is a rare, benign, mediastinal mass of thymic origin. It may remain asymptomatic despite massive size and up to 50% in some series are associated with autoimmune disease. CT scan gives fat density and encapsulated benign nature and biopsy usually establishes the diagnosis. Preoperative tissue diagnosis is important as now the availability of thoracoscopic option is best suited to reduce morbidity. Treatment of choice is total excision using open surgical, minimal invasive techniques or robotic surgery and the prognosis is excellent.
