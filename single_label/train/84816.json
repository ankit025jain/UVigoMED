{"id":84816,"title":"[Progress on prevention for anterior knee pain after primary total knee arthroplasty].","abstract":"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) identified as an effective treatment for ultimate knee joint disease can effectively relieve pain, correct deformity, improve knee function and enhance the quality of life of patients. Patient satisfaction has been increasingly considered as an important factor in evaluating the success of primary TKA. Anterior knee pain that usually appears in the region of the anterior knee is a recognized complaint for primary TKA and has a strong impact on the improvement of knee function and patient satisfaction of primary TKA. Accordingly, the relief of anterior knee pain has become one of the primary goals of primary TKA. At present, soft tissue lesions around the patellar caused by patellar maltracking and the elevation of internal pressure in subchondral bone because of the high contact stress of patellofemoral joint are both considered as the mechanism of anterior knee pain. For the past few years,on increasing number of studies have focused on the prevention of anterior knee pain following primary TKA. However, none of the past treatment such as patellar resurfacing, patellar denervation without patellar resurfacing or a mobile-bearing prosthesis has a good and affirmative effect on it. The prevention and treatment of anterior knee pain following primary TKA still is a difficult solved problem. To address this problem, we need further researches about the cause of anterior knee pain, knee joint prosthesis and biomechanics of patellofemoral joint, as well as lots of randomized controlled trials.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029849","annotations":[{"name":"Epiphysis","weight":0.847436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphysis"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.816042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.798534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.759622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.699927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.652831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.616438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Arthritis","weight":0.58252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.513614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.469202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.341109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Knee pain","weight":0.321041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_pain"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.100374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0339747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"}]}
