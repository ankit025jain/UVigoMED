{"id":59313,"title":"Lipoxin A4 regulates expression of the estrogen receptor and inhibits 17?-estradiol induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in human endometriotic stromal cells.","abstract":"To study the role of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in endometriosis.Molecular analysis in human samples and primary human endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs).University hospital.Forty-nine premenopausal women (30 patients with endometriosis and 19 controls).Normal and ectopic endometrial biopsies obtained during surgery performed during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle; ESCs used for in vitro studies.Levels of LXA4 measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); mRNA levels of the estrogen receptor (ER), progestogen receptor (PR), tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) quantified by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) phosphorylation evaluated by Western blotting.The LXA4 expression level decreased in ectopic tissue as well as ER? and PR, although the expression of ER? increased in ectopic endometrium compared with the controls. Investigations with correlation analysis revealed the expression of LXA4 was positively correlated with ER? and negatively correlated with ER? in vivo. Moreover, administering LXA4 could augment ER? expression in ESCs and inhibit the 17?-estradiol-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK very likely through ER?.Our findings indicate that LXA4 regulates ER? expression and inhibits 17?-estradiol-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, very likely through ER? in ESCs.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy
