{"id":50719,"title":"Control of hypertension after roux-en-y gastric bypass among obese diabetic patients.","abstract":"Hypertension is a common disorder in general practice and has a widely known association with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Low adhesion to clinical treatment may lead to poor results. Obesity surgery can bring early and relevant resolution rates of both morbidities.To describe hypertension evolution after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Descriptive observational study designed as a historical cohort of 90 subjects with hypertension and diabetes who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and were evaluated before and after surgery.It was observed a hypertension resolution rate of 85.6% along with markedly decrease in anti-hypertensive usage. Mean resolution time was 3.2 months. Resolution was associated with homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance, preoperative fasting insulin, anti-hypertensive usage, hypertension time, body mass index and percentage of weight loss. Resolution of hypertension was not statistically associated with diabetes remission within this sample.Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was a safe and effective therapeutic tool to achieve hypertension resolution in patients who also had diabetes mellitus.","date":"2014-04-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760059","annotations":[{"name":"Bariatrics","weight":0.97291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatrics"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.874117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.866133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Antihypertensive drug","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drug"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.824766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.818442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.804517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Gastric bypass surgery","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.666097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.45027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.316135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.315754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.286341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.267177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.104857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Control theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
