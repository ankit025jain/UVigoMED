{"id":88885,"title":"Valgus osteotomy and repositioning and fixation with a dynamic hip screw and a 135º single-angled barrel plate for un-united and neglected femoral neck fractures.","abstract":"To review the outcome of 60 patients who underwent valgus subtrochanteric osteotomy and its repositioning for un-united and neglected femoral neck fractures.60 patients (mean age, 35 years) underwent valgus subtrochanteric osteotomy and repositioning of the osteotomy and fixation with a dynamic hip screw and a 135° single-angled barrel plate for closed un-united femoral neck fractures after failed internal fixation (n=27) or neglected (>3 weeks) fractures (n=33). The most common fracture type was transcervical (n=48), followed by subcapital (n=6) and basal (n=6). All patients had displaced femoral neck fractures (Garden types 3 and 4). According to the Pauwel angle, 45 fractures were type 2 (30º-70º) and 15 were type 3 (>70º).Patients were followed up for a mean of 3.5 (range, 2-7.5) years. The mean Pauwel angle of the fracture was corrected from 65° (range, 50°-89°) to 26° (range, 25°-28°). Bone union was achieved in 56 patients after a mean of 3.9 (range, 3-5.5) months. The mean Harris hip score improved from 65 to 87.5. Outcome was excellent in 30 patients, good in 24, and poor in 6. Four of the patients developed avascular necrosis; 2 of whom nonetheless achieved a good outcome.Valgus osteotomy and repositioning and fixation with a dynamic hip screw and a 135° single-angled barrel plate was effective treatment for un-united and neglected femoral neck fractures.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781606","annotations":[{"name":"Avascular necrosis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avascular_necrosis"},{"name":"Osteotomy","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteotomy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.764089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.690594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.573204,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Valgus deformity","weight":0.403074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus_deformity"},{"name":"Femur neck","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_neck"},{"name":"Cervical fracture","weight":0.251337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_fracture"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.223208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Dynamic hip screw","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_hip_screw"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Basal (phylogenetics)","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Displacement (ship)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(ship)"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"},{"name":"Valgus","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgus"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Positioning (marketing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
