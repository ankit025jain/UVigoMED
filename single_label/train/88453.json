{"id":88453,"title":"Adiposed-derived stem cells seeded on PLCL/P123 eletrospun nanofibrous scaffold enhance wound healing.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the wound healing of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) seeded on electrospinning poly (L-lactide-co-?-caprolactone)/poloxamer (PLCL/P123) scaffolds and the mechanisms using a rat skin tissue injury model. CM-Dil labeled ADSCs were seeded on PLCL/P123 scaffolds for 48 h (ADSCs- PLCL/P123). Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: ADSCs-PLCL/P123 (A group); PLCL/P123 alone (B group); petrolatum gauze (C group). Two 1.5 cm diameter circular impressions were made by placement of a punch biopsy instrument. The wound closure percentages were calculated by planimetry on postoperative day 0, 3, 12 and 21. On postoperative day 21, full-thickness skins from each group were examined by H&E staining, CK10 and CD31 immunohistochemical staining, and CK10 immunofluorescence staining respectively. The wound closure percentages on postoperative day 21 in A, B and C groups were 95.7% ± 3.9%, 83.2% ± 15.4% and 64.3% ± 6.2%, respectively (p < 0.05). H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining showed that the epidermal structure of A group was complete and possessed the characteristics of epidermal cells, and the CK10 staining positive suggested that ADSCs were differentiated into epidermal-like structures. The microvessel density of A group was significantly higher than that of the B and C groups (p < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed between B group and C group (p > 0.05). The ADSCs seeded on PLCL/P123 scaffolds could promote wound healing and have the potential to become a new therapeutic alternative material for skin tissue engineering.","date":"2014-05-28","categories":"Wounds and
