{"id":4423,"title":"[Dehelmintization of wastewater at treatment plants in Tashkent city].","abstract":"The aim of the study is to examine the extent of contamination of wastewater with helminth eggs in Tashkent city, as well as to estimate the efficacy of their deworming at wastewater treatment plants. As a result of the study untreated domestic waste waters were found to contain eggs ofascarids, whipworm, tapeworm dwarf pinworms. Specific weight of the eggs of ascarids among other helminth species is 68%, whipworm eggs--30.9%.","date":"2014-10-13","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25306697","annotations":[{"name":"Parasitic worm","weight":0.918038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_worm"},{"name":"Cestoda","weight":0.813027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.760471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Deworming","weight":0.381855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deworming"},{"name":"Sewage treatment","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment"},{"name":"Contamination","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.252112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Wastewater","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater"},{"name":"Trichuris trichiura","weight":0.157246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichuris_trichiura"},{"name":"Municipal solid waste","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste"},{"name":"Waste","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste"},{"name":"Tashkent","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent"},{"name":"Specific weight","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_weight"},{"name":"Enterobius","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobius"},{"name":"Ascariasis","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascariasis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"}]}
