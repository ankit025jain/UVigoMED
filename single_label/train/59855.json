{"id":59855,"title":"The role of positron emission tomography-computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging in the management of sarcoidosis patients.","abstract":"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic findings as well as by histopathological findings. Molecular imaging in recent years has made important progress regarding the study of various inflammatory diseases including sarcoidosis. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides an insight in metabolism of this disease. Positron emission tomography with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) has shown effectiveness in detecting occult disease and assessing disease activity during treatment. This review article provides an overview of the applications of PET/computed tomography and PET/ magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of patients with sarcoidosis.
