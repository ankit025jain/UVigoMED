{"id":52952,"title":"[Biofeedback: a new method for the prevention of amputations in patients with diabetes].","abstract":"Lower limb amputations in patients with diabetes are still a huge public health problem. Despite of our knowledge and advanced technical tools, the incidence of amputations and they relapses remain very high and inacceptable. A key role in primary and secondary prevention of amputations is the foot off-loading. We dispose different off-loading devices and techniques which are efficient on short term. However, knowledge about its long term efficacy is missing. In this article, we review different methods of foot off-loading. We also describe a new method for diabetic foot off-loading based on the biofeedback technique we recently developed.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558906","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.817027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.631923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.1201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Amputation","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation"},{"name":"Biofeedback","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Lower limb","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_limb"},{"name":"Diabetic foot","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_foot"},{"name":"Key (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)"},{"name":"Economic efficiency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_efficiency"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Foot","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
