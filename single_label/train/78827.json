{"id":78827,"title":"Chronic rhinosinusitis.","abstract":"A 50-year-old woman with nonallergic rhinitis, asthma, and aspirin intolerance presented with worsening symptoms of nasal congestion, purulent drainage, and anosmia. Nasal polyps were visualized on anterior rhinoscopy, and there was evidence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) on imaging studies during work-up for another medical condition. Over a 2-year period she had numerous bouts of acute exacerbations of CRS which required multiple courses of antibiotics; however, she was unwilling to undergo surgery to reduce polyp burden. She successfully underwent aspirin desensitization and experienced partial relief of symptoms with daily aspirin ingestion. Nasal obstruction is a common symptom that can result from multiple causes, including mucosal disorders (eg, allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, sarcoid) and structural disorders (eg, nasal septal deviation, tumors, mucoceles). The various causes and work-up for nasal obstruction are discussed with emphasis placed on CRS, which is a prevalent disease characterized by inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses for a duration of >12 weeks. The different subtypes of CRS, including CRS with and without nasal polyps, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, are discussed along with pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment options.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic
