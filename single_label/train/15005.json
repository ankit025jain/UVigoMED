{"id":15005,"title":"Peste des Petits Ruminants virus: an emerging threat to goat farming in Pakistan.","abstract":"Pakistan at present is having more than 60 million head of goats, which consist of about 37 well-recognized breeds found in different regions of the country. Although the goat farming on commercial level is escalating in Pakistan, there are threats, which result this initiative into a loss. Among these threats, Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) outbreaks are causing huge economic damages. In this study, three outbreaks of PPR were confirmed at three different commercial farms in various regions of Punjab province and their economic impact on small ruminants farming was calculated. The disease started after 1-2 months of the establishment of these farms as the animals were purchased from different livestock markets. Disease started with sudden onset of respiratory and enteric clinical signs and spreads quickly. Disease caused mortality and morbidity of 10-15% and 20-40%, respectively, within a time period of 01-03 weeks. At these three farms, 116 of 365 animals exhibited the clinical disease, with an overall morbidity rate of 31.78%. A total of 43 animals died with mortality rate of 11.78% (43/365) causing a direct financial loss of $4300 (Pakistan Rupees 430,000/-), while the indirect cost due to treatment, loss of animal body condition, reduction in market value, increase veterinary services and labour was $7911 (Pak Rs. 791,100/-). Taken together, the results demonstrate that there is an urgent need to assess the economic impact of the disease throughout the country and to give proper emphasis for controlling PPR in sensitive regions where it is discouraging the investment in goat farming.","date":"2014-08-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24393390","annotations":[{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Goat","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Livestock","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Commerce","weight":0.647027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce"},{"name":"Agriculture","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Ruminant","weight":0.470167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"},{"name":"Finance","weight":0.459993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"},{"name":"Bubonic plague","weight":0.452831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague"},{"name":"Investment","weight":0.43254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Factory farming","weight":0.412609,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_farming"},{"name":"Labour economics","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.287812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.282573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pakistan","weight":0.247222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"},{"name":"Market","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.158606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Punjab, India","weight":0.141923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India"},{"name":"Rupee","weight":0.137589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.120719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Punjab, Pakistan","weight":0.114027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0771447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Damages","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages"},{"name":"Indirect costs","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_costs"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Market capitalization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization"},{"name":"Dog breed","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed"}]}
