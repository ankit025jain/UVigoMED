{"id":29937,"title":"A validation study of the English version of the AlQol 9 to measure quality of life.","abstract":"Quality of life (QoL) is an important clinical and research outcome within the drug and alcohol abuse context. The AlQoL 9 is a specific questionnaire designed to assess health- and non-health-related consequences of alcoholism. The English version of the AlQoL 9 has not been validated using a larger sample.The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the English version of AlQoL 9 in a sample of treatment-seeking individuals in Australia.A sample of 138 participants from inpatient and outpatient treatments facilities completed the AlQoL 9 test and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Assessment-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). The study's investigative parameters included the demographic characteristics of the sample, internal structure, and convergent validity. Furthermore, correlations between the AlQoL 9 scale scores and the scores obtained from the WHOQOL-BREF test were investigated using Pearson product-moment correlation analyses.The English version of the AlQoL 9 attained a significant Cronbach's alpha of 0.825. The mean score obtained in the test was 21.92 (SD?=?6.79). Using Varimax rotation, the AlQoL 9 yielded one principal factor that had accounted for 37.85% of variance. Convergent validity analysis demonstrated significant correlations (p?<?0.001) between the AlQoL 9 scores and the scores of all four dimensions of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire.The present study demonstrated that the English version of the AlQoL 9 constitutes a valid and reliable research instrument for evaluating quality of life among alcohol-dependent individuals.","date":"2014-03-04","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588420","annotations":[{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Alcoholism","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.803695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.745458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Psychometrics","weight":0.632415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.625661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.60203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.562163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.518173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.482132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.457256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.45696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.417896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.409686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.208815,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0677463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Child abuse","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Dimension","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension"},{"name":"Life (magazine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)"},{"name":"Varimax rotation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varimax_rotation"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"Detective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective"},{"name":"Karl Pearson","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Spacetime","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Scale (social sciences)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(social_sciences)"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
