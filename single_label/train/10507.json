{"id":10507,"title":"Antipyretic activity of decoction of Joshanda and its saponin and sterol contents: validation in an animal-based model.","abstract":"Joshanda is a polyherbal product that is commonly used in the treatment of cold and flu usually accompanied by fever. The present study was designed to scrutinize the antipyretic activity of a decoction of Joshanda and its total saponin and sterol contents in brewer's yeast induced febrile mice. The results revealed marked attenuation of induced pyrexia by the decoction and its saponin contents during various assessment times (1-5 hours) in a dose-dependent manner, which were not supported by sterol contents. The maximum antihyperthermic effect of the decoction and saponin contents were 75.38% and 81.32%, respectively, at 300 mg/kg i.p. This findings suggested that Joshanda extracts strongly ameliorated induced pyrexia and thus validated it as a useful household remedy for cold and flu accompanied by fever.
