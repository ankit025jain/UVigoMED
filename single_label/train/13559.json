{"id":13559,"title":"Structural modifications of neuroprotective anti-Parkinsonian (-)-N6-(2-(4-(biphenyl-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)-ethyl)-N6-propyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[d]thiazole-2,6-diamine (D-264): an effort toward the improvement of in vivo efficacy of the parent molecule.","abstract":"In our overall goal to develop multifunctional dopamine D2/D3 agonist drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), we previously synthesized potent D3 preferring agonist D-264 (1a), which exhibited neuroprotective properties in two animal models of PD. To enhance the in vivo efficacy of 1a, a structure-activity relationship study was carried out. Competitive binding and [(35)S]GTP?S functional assays identified compound (-)-9b as one of the lead molecules with preferential D3 agonist activity (EC50(GTP?S); D3 = 0.10 nM; D2/D3 (EC50): 159). Compounds (-)-9b and (-)-8b exhibited high in vivo activity in two PD animal models, reserpinized and 6-hydroxydopamine (OHDA)-induced unilateral lesioned rats. On the other hand, 1a failed to show any in vivo activity in these models unless the compound was dissolved in 5-10% beta-hydroxy propyl cyclodextrin solution. Lead compounds exhibited appreciable radical scavenging activity. In vitro experiments with dopaminergic MN9D cells indicated neuroprotection by both 1a and (-)-9b from toxicity of MPP+.
