{"id":79237,"title":"Calcium hydroxylapatite injection for the patulous Eustachian tube.","abstract":"The function of the E-tube is to adjust the balance of both sides of the ear drum. The patulous Eustachian tube (PET) is a rare disease and a benign condition. So, most of the doctors ignored this disease. But, patients with PET suffer from ear fullness, autophony, hearing their own breathing, and etc. Many treatment methods have been introduced and injection is also one way of treating the disease. We introduce an injection technique for the treatment of PET using calcium hydroxylapatitie (RadiesseÂ®).
