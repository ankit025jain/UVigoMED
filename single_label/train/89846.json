{"id":89846,"title":"Overexpressing neuroglobin improves functional recovery by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis after spinal cord injury.","abstract":"The current study was performed to evaluate the mechanisms and therapeutic effects of overexpressing neuroglobin (Ngb) on spinal cord injury (SCI). Adeno-associated virus (AAV) was injected in the T12 section 7 days before SCI. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: a sham group, a vehicle group, an AAV-EGFP group and an AAV-Ngb group. Recovery of hind limb locomotor function was determined during the 3-week post operation period by the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale. At 24 h after SCI and at the end of the study, the segments of spinal cord, centered with the lesion site were harvested for histopathological analysis. Immunofluorescence was performed using antibodies to recognize neuN in the lesion sections. At 24 h after SCI, the spinal cord tissue samples were removed to analyze tissue concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Apoptotic cells were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) kit. The expression of bcl-2, bax, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-3, were determined by Western blot assay and immunostaining analysis. The results showed that animals overexpressing Ngb had significantly greater recovery of locomotor function, less neuronal loss and fewer apoptotic cells. In addition, overexpressing Ngb significantly increased bcl-2 expression and SOD level, decreased bax expression, attenuated the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol fraction, and reduced the activity of caspase-3 and MDA level after SCI. These findings suggest, that overexpressing Ngb can significantly improve the recovery of locomotor function. This neuroprotective effect may be associated with the inhibition of neural apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway.","date":"2014-04-22","categories":"Wounds and
