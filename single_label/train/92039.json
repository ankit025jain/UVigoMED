{"id":92039,"title":"Smoking and outcome of traumatic brain injury.","abstract":"There is evidence that the cholinergic system is involved in cognitive sequels of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are known to have a major role in cognitive functions. Smokers have up-regulation of these receptors. This study investigated whether smoking is associated with the outcome from TBI.A specific questionnaire was sent, after checking inclusion and exclusion criteria, to 1022 subjects with TBI who had visited the neurological outpatient clinic of a university hospital during a 14-year period. Of these, 689 (67.4%) responded, forming the final study population. Associations between demographic variables, injury severity and outcome and smoking history were analysed using multivariate methods.Smokers were more often men (p?<?0.001), younger at the time of the injury (p?=?0.008) and had less education (p?<?0.0001). In univariate analysis, non-smokers did not differ for outcome of TBI by GOS-E (p?=?0.08). Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, no association was found between smoking history and TBI outcome.This study does not suggest that smoking affects the outcome of TBI.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456055","annotations":[{"name":"Traumatic brain injury","weight":0.909192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.669335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.650261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Cholinergic","weight":0.570919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholinergic"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.521449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"Acetylcholine","weight":0.395147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.363434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.331498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.288964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.258843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.125212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.120141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Cognitive deficit","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_deficit"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Sequel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.0123718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"}]}
