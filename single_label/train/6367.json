{"id":6367,"title":"[Effect of simvastatin on atherosclerosis and central aortic pressure in ApoE gene knockout mice].","abstract":"To investigate the effects of simvastatin on atherosclerosis and central aortic pressure in ApoE-knockout (ApoE-/-) mice.Ten 5-week-old male ApoE-/- mice and 5 C57 mice were fed with high-lipid diet for 3 weeks, and then C57 mice (WT group) and 5 ApoE-/- mice (ApoE-/- group) were given 1% carboxymethyl cellulose solution (8 ml·kg-1·d-1), and another 5 ApoE-/- mice (ApoE-/-/S group) were given simvastatin solution (50 mg·kg-1·d-1) by gavege for 3 weeks. The areas of atherosclerotic lesion in aortic root, central aortic pressure and serum lipid levels were examined.No atherosclerotic plaques were observed in WT group. Compared with ApoE-/- group, simvastatin significantly decreased atherosclerotic lesion area in aortic root (89 818.05±16 980.93 ?m2 vs 34 937.01±13 280.65 ?m2, P<0.05). The systolic pressure (SP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP) and diastolic pressure (DP) of central aortic pressure were significantly increased in ApoE-/- group compared with those in WT group (P<0.05). Compared to ApoE-/- group, the SP, MAP and PP of central aortic pressure were significantly reduced in ApoE-/-/S group (P<0.05). SP and MAP of central aortic pressure were positively correlated with atherosclerotic lesion area (SP: r=0.7152, P=0.0461; PP: r=0.7594? P=0.0288). Compared with WT group, serum triglyceride, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels were markedly increased in ApoE-/- group (P<0.05). Serum high-density lipoprotein level was decreased in ApoE-/- group compared with WT group. No differences in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein levels were found between ApoE-/- group and ApoE-/-/S group.Simvastatin can attenuate atherosclerosis of aorta in ApoE-/- mice, which is associated with the reduced central aortic systolic pressure but not with the serum lipids levels.","date":"2014-07-07","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24998652","annotations":[{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Atherosclerosis","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"},{"name":"Simvastatin","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simvastatin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cellulose","weight":0.818326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose"},{"name":"Knockout mouse","weight":0.815558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.806339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Apolipoprotein E","weight":0.797842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.774814,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Lipoprotein","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.567953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.486135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.421206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Blood lipids","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Mean arterial pressure","weight":0.26411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_arterial_pressure"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.249893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.131231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Pulse pressure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_pressure"},{"name":"Carboxymethyl cellulose","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxymethyl_cellulose"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Polypropylene","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene"}]}
