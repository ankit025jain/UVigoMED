{"id":28242,"title":"[Experimental study on pseudoallergic reaction of Qingkailing injection].","abstract":"Pseudoallergic reactions of Qingkailing injection (QKLI) was assessed by vascular hyperpermeability which were indicated by ear blue staining in ICR mice after single intravenous injection of QKLI mixed with Evans blue (EB) and skin blue spot formation in SD rats after intradermal injection of QKLI and intravenous injection of EB. In addition, QKLI-induced histamine, VEGF, TNF-alpha release was measured after ICR mice received the single dosing of QKLI iv. The mild vascular hyperpermeability characterized by ear blue staining could be observed in mice after intravenous injection of QKLI and EB. Intracutaneous injection of 50 micro L of test solution containing QKLI (25,50 microL) in rat back skin caused obvious local vascular hyperpermeability at the injection sites so as to result the larger diameters of blue spots than that in negative control group (P <0. 01). QKLI induced a significant increase of VEGF and a slight elevation of histamine in mice after intravenous administration, while TNF-alpha showed no change after QKLI iv. The results in this study indicated that both intravenous injection and intracutanous injection of QKLI could induce vascular hyperpemeability so as to cause pseudoallergic reaction in mice and rats. QKLI-induced pseudoallergic reaction may be associated with the release of histamine and VEGF.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946558","annotations":[{"name":"Histamine","weight":0.82379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histamine"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.729883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.72101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Dermis","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.639331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.637682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.586964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.542846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.493687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.392516,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Multiple chemical sensitivity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_chemical_sensitivity"},{"name":"Evans blue","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_blue"},{"name":"Blue","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Bronze Age","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Learning music by ear","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_music_by_ear"},{"name":"Microwave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Intelligent character recognition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_character_recognition"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
