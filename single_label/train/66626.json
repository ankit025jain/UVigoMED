{"id":66626,"title":"Second-generation and newly approved antipsychotics, serum prolactin levels and sexual dysfunctions: a critical literature review.","abstract":"Using antipsychotic (AP) medication can increase prolactin (PRL) levels and place the patient at risk of sexual dysfunction (SD).The aim of this review is to describe the PRL propensity of the different second-generation and newly approved APs. It then considers the prevalence rates of SDs associated with these compounds in patients with schizophrenia and treatment strategies for the management of SDs and/or hyperprolactinemia (HPRL). Furthermore, we address the lingering question regarding the association between SDs and PRL.SD (particularly long-term) data remain scarce for several APs. A wide variety of assessment techniques used in SD research make reliable comparisons between APs impossible. The majority of these reports do not equally allow us to distinguish between treatment (AP and co-medication)-emergent SDs and illness-related SDs. This makes it difficult to assess the degree to which these side effects are associated with 'PRL-raising' APs, and what part of this fraction is directly reducible to serum PRL levels. Also, few evidence-based treatment strategies for HPRL and associated side effects are available. Therefore, longer-term randomized controlled trials, using reliable and valid structured interviews or questionnaires, are necessary to establish the precise relationship between APs, PRL levels and SDs rates and develop valuable treatment options.","date":"2014-04-18","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24697217","annotations":[{"name":"Antipsychotic","weight":0.844161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"},{"name":"Prolactin","weight":0.839173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.833713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.735773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.725212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.677308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.612631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.585337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.558821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.410244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Hyperprolactinaemia","weight":0.327124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperprolactinaemia"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.253147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Associated Press","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"},{"name":"Reductionism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism"},{"name":"Professional association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_association"}]}
