{"id":46904,"title":"EPHX1 Tyr113His and His139Arg polymorphisms in esophageal cancer risk: a meta-analysis.","abstract":"Microsomal epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) is an important biological phase II metabolic enzyme that is extensively involved in the metabolism of diverse environmental carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines. Many articles have reported the association between EPHX1 (Tyr113His and His139Arg) polymorphisms and esophageal cancer risk, but the results are controversial. This study aimed to identify the association between EPHX1 (Tyr113His and His139Arg) polymorphisms and esophageal cancer risk by meta-analysis. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was used to evaluate the strength of the associations. Heterogeneity was estimated by the chi-square-based Q-statistic test and the P value. Meanwhile, the random-effect or fixed-effect model was used according to the between-study heterogeneity. Begg's funnel plot and the Egger test were performed to assess the publication bias of articles. Finally, 8 case-control studies involving 1158 cases and 1868 controls for the Tyr113His polymorphism and 7 case-control studies involving 901 cases and 1615 controls for the His139Arg polymorphism were included in this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the Tyr113His polymorphism was a stronger power trend towards risk for esophageal cancer using a recessive model (CC versus CT+TT, OR = 1.204, 95%CI = 1.001-1.450, P = 0.049). However, no significant associated risk was found between the His139Arg polymorphism and esophageal cancer. These findings suggest that the Tyr113His polymorphism might be a stronger power trend towards risk for esophageal cancer. However, no evidence was found for the association between the EPHX1 His139Arg polymorphism and esophageal cancer risk.
