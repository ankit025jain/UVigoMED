{"id":86519,"title":"Incidence of T790M mutation in (sequential) rebiopsies in EGFR-mutated NSCLC-patients.","abstract":"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-patients with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutation have median progression-free survival (PFS) of 12 months on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Resistance is mediated by the EGFR T790M-mutation in the majority of patients. Longitudinal follow-up data are lacking. We retrospectively evaluated EGFR-mutated NSCLC-patients who were rebiopsied after TKI-treatment. A subgroup was sequentially rebiopsied along the course of the disease.Advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC-patients who had both a pre-TKI biopsy and post-TKI biopsy available were included. Information on treatments and (re)biopsies was collected chronologically. Primary endpoint was the incidence of the T790M-mutation.Sixty-six patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In first post-TKI biopsies, T790M-mutation was detected in 34 patients (52%) of patients. Twenty-seven patients had subsequent post-TKI rebiopsies with mutation analysis available; in 10 patients (37%) the T790M-status in subsequent post-TKI rebiopsies was not consistent with the T790M-status of the first post-TKI biopsy. Progression free survival (PFS) on TKI-treatment was 12.0 months. Objective response rate on TKI-treatment was 81%. Patients developing T790M-mutation at post-TKI biopsy had longer median PFS compared to T790M-negative patients (14.2 versus 11.1 months respectively (P=0.034)) and longer overall survival (45.9 months versus 29.8 months respectively (P=0.213)). Transformation to SCLC was detected in 1 patient (2%).Incidence of T790M-mutation at first post-TKI biopsy in this cohort of EGFR-mutated NSCLC-patients was 52%. Detection of T790M-mutation was not consistent over time; some patients who were T790M-positive at first post-TKI biopsy became T790M-negative in later post-TKI rebiopsies and vice versa. T790M-positive patients showed longer PFS than T790M-negative patients. Whether the low incidence of transformation to SCLC is justifying post-TKI rebiopsy in EGFR-mutated NSCLC-patients with acquired TKI-resistance in regular clinical practice is debatable.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24768581","annotations":[{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.866126,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tyrosine kinase","weight":0.7781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.722028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tyrosine","weight":0.67921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.611024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Kinase","weight":0.46538,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.391213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.381252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.333147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.322201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.301251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.227246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Chronology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology"},{"name":"Protein kinase inhibitor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor"}]}
