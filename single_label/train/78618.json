{"id":78618,"title":"[Clinical analysis of short-term efficacy in senile sudden deafness].","abstract":"To analysis the short-term medicinal treating effects in senile sudden deafness.According the age. The sudden deafness patients were divided into to groups, older age-group (age > or = 60, a total of 70 cases), control group (age < 60, a total of 70 cases), period of treatment was 7 days, the result of pure tone test were reviewed, compared the improvement before and after treatment.After treatment, the average hearing threshold of the older age-patients was improved. There was statistical difference (P < 0.05); effective rate of the senile sudden deafness patients (disease time < or = 7 days) was 61.76%, (disease time > 7 days) was 38.89%. There was statistical difference (P < 0.05); the total effective rate of the senile sudden deafness patients was 49.9%; the senile sudden deafness patients which following moderate deafness (hearing threshold < 55 dB), effective rate was 52%, control group was 84.62%. There was statistical difference (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the patients with severe hearing loss.The Course of disease has important significance for the prognosis of the senile sudden deafness patients. As soon as possible to improve peripheral vascular microcirculation, the prognosis could be improve conspicuously the prognosis of the senile sudden deafness patients were worse than the young patients.","date":"2014-03-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24616989","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.488248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.409879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Clinical research","weight":0.369179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.298552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Absolute threshold of hearing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold_of_hearing"},{"name":"Microcirculation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcirculation"},{"name":"Pure tone","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_tone"},{"name":"Decibel","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Peripheral vascular disease","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_vascular_disease"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Muscle tone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
