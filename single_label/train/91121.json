{"id":91121,"title":"\"Good intentions, but inadequate practices\"--sun protection in early childhood centres, a qualitative study from New Zealand.","abstract":"To examine sun protection policies and practices in New Zealand teacher-led early childhood centres, identifying underlying factors and key steps to support effective sun protection.This qualitative study used a review of sun protection information on the New Zealand Ministry of Education early childhood \"ECE Lead\" website; 10 key informant interviews; and a review of sun protection policy documents provided by key informants.The data indicated a lack of comprehensive sun protection policies and practices; while sunscreen and hats were focused on, sun protective hats, role-modelling and protective clothing were frequently not emphasised. Key underlying reasons for these failures were: (i) insufficient emphasis on sun protection in government early childhood regulatory and monitoring processes, due to focusing on other priorities, and (ii) centre staff lacking access to sun protection information.Recommendations include: (i) that early childhood regulations specifically include sun protection; and (ii) easy access for staff and parents to appropriate evidenced-based information about sun protection. The implications for other countries are that, despite written sun protection policies, and motivated staff, factors such as insufficient emphasis on sun protection in regulations, and inadequate access to information can undermine the quality of sun protection in early childhood centres.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548956","annotations":[{"name":"Education","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.479468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.392122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"New Zealand","weight":0.294585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Clothing","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing"},{"name":"Sun","weight":0.130071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"},{"name":"Informant","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Website","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Sunscreen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen"},{"name":"Ministry of Education (New Zealand)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(New_Zealand)"},{"name":"Personal protective equipment","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Centrism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism"},{"name":"Key (lock)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(lock)"},{"name":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education,_Culture,_Sports,_Science_and_Technology"},{"name":"United Nations Economic Commission for Europe","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_Commission_for_Europe"},{"name":"Zealand","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Business process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Freedom of information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information"}]}
