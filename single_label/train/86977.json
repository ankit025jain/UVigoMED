{"id":86977,"title":"[A review of detection methods for human bocaviruses].","abstract":"Human bocavirus (HBoV) 1-4 have been detected both in respiratory and stool samples since the first HBoV was discovered in 2005. HBoV-1 is mostly associated with respiratory infection, while HBoV 2-4 are usually associated with intestinal tract infection. A variety of signs and symptoms have been described in patients with HBoV infection, including cough, wheezing, pneumonia, and diarrhea, but the research on pathogenic mechanism of HBoV is limited because HBoV cannot be cultured in vitro due to the lack of appropriate host cells. Three-dimensional epithelial cell culture, reverse genetics, and viral metagenomics are identified as novel tools that may promote the research on pathogenic mechanism of HBoV and the discovery of new viruses. This review summaries currently available diagnostic approaches such as electron microscopy, cell culture, PCR, and immunoassay in order to provide a method reference for indepth research on HBoV.","date":"2014-08-14","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118386","annotations":[{"name":"Reverse genetics","weight":0.935439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_genetics"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.784086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.778052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Respiratory tract infection","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Cough","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Human gastrointestinal tract","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract"},{"name":"Human feces","weight":0.625688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.624518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.610903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.569579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.505584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.318165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Wheeze","weight":0.278888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeze"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.19231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Mechanism (biology)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(biology)"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment"}]}
