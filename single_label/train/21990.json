{"id":21990,"title":"Decreasing incidence rates of bacteremia: a 9-year population-based study.","abstract":"Numerous studies have shown that the incidence rate of bacteremia has been increasing over time. However, few studies have distinguished between community-acquired, healthcare-associated and nosocomial bacteremia.We conducted a population-based study among adults with first-time bacteremia in Funen County, Denmark, during 2000-2008 (N = 7786). We reported mean and annual incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years), overall and by place of acquisition. Trends were estimated using a Poisson regression model.The overall incidence rate was 215.7, including 99.0 for community-acquired, 50.0 for healthcare-associated and 66.7 for nosocomial bacteremia. During 2000-2008, the overall incidence rate decreased by 23.3% from 254.1 to 198.8 (3.3% annually, p < .001), the incidence rate of community-acquired bacteremia decreased by 25.6% from 119.0 to 93.8 (3.7% annually, p < .001) and the incidence rate of nosocomial bacteremia decreased by 28.9% from 82.2 to 56.0 (4.2% annually, p < .001). The incidence rate of healthcare-associated bacteremia remained stable. The most common microorganisms were Escherichia coli (28.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.0%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.1%). Regardless of place of acquisition, the proportion of bacteremias caused by enterococci increased (p < .05) and the proportion caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci decreased (p < .05).The incidence rates of community-acquired and nosocomial bacteremia decreased substantially over time.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576825","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.903181,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.269585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Enterococcus","weight":0.216667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.213889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.204468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.171124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.154468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0637772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Streptococcus","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.0537772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Funen County","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funen_County"},{"name":"Poisson regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression"},{"name":"Funen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funen"},{"name":"254","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/254"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Aureus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus"},{"name":"Trends (short story)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_(short_story)"},{"name":"Poisson distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
