{"id":91804,"title":"Biomechanical comparison of the four-strand cruciate and Strickland techniques in animal tendons.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to compare two four-strand techniques: the traditional Strickland and cruciate techniques.Thirty-eight Achilles tendons were removed from 19 rabbits and were assigned to two groups based on suture technique (Group 1, Strickland suture; Group 2, cruciate repair). The sutured tendons were subjected to constant progressive distraction using a universal testing machine (KratosÂ®). Based on data from the instrument, which were synchronized with the visualized gap at the suture site and at the time of suture rupture, the following data were obtained: maximum load to rupture, maximum deformation or gap, time elapsed until failure, and stiffness.In the statistical analysis, the data were parametric and unpaired, and by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the sample distribution was normal. By Student's t-test, there was no significant difference in any of the data: the cruciate repair sutures had slightly better mean stiffness, and the Strickland sutures had longer time-elapsed suture ruptures and higher average maximum deformation.The cruciate and Strickland techniques for flexor tendon sutures have similar mechanical characteristics in vitro.","date":"2014-01-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473513","annotations":[{"name":"Animal","weight":0.462499,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.310454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.285351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.261579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.13919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Achilles tendon","weight":0.112985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Deformation (engineering)","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering)"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Achilles","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles"},{"name":"Universal testing machine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_testing_machine"},{"name":"Kratos (God of War)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratos_(God_of_War)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Earthquake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Distribution (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Annular ligaments of fingers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_ligaments_of_fingers"},{"name":"Empirical distribution function","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function"},{"name":"Universe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anterior cruciate ligament","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament"},{"name":"Distraction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distraction"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"}]}
