{"id":30059,"title":"Successful outpatient graded administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in patients without HIV and with a history of sulfonamide adverse drug reaction.","abstract":"The outcomes of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) desensitization have been widely reported in the HIV literature but less so in the non-HIV literature.To evaluate the safety and efficacy of graded administration of TMP-SMX in patients without HIV and with a history of TMP-SMX adverse drug reaction (ADR).A retrospective chart review, 2004-2012, of all the patients without HIV seen in the Division of Allergic Diseases and with a history of TMP-SMX ADR who underwent outpatient graded administration of TMP-SMX was conducted. The medical record was reviewed for age, sex, details of the initial ADR to TMP-SMX, an indication for TMP-SMX administration, and outcome. Patients also were contacted by telephone, and medical records were reviewed to determine long-term outcomes.Seventy-two patients (46 women [64%]; mean [SD] age, 57.7 Â± 13.89 years]) were included. The most common patient-reported reactions to TMP-SMX were rash 39 (54%), and hives 9 (13%). TMP-SMX administration was needed for the following indications: prophylaxis (62 [86%]) and treatment of infection (10 [14%]). Forty-three of the patients (60%) underwent a 1-day TMP-SMX administration protocol. Thirty-five of the 43 (81%) underwent a 6-step (90 minutes to 6 hours) protocol and 7 of the 43 (16%) underwent a novel 14-step TMP-SMX protocol. Twenty-nine (40%) underwent a >1-day TMP-SMX administration protocol. Our overall success rate was 90% (mean duration of 11 months). Ninety-eight percent of the patients successfully completed a 1-day graded administration protocol, and 76% successfully completed a >1-day protocol. TMP-SMX was stopped in 8 patients because of the ADR.We report the largest case series of successful outpatient graded administration of TMP-SMX with both 1-day and >1-day protocols, which have shown to be safe and well tolerated in patients without HIV and with a history of sulfonamide ADR.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565769","annotations":[{"name":"Adverse drug reaction","weight":0.894492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction"},{"name":"Sulfonamide (medicine)","weight":0.891621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonamide_(medicine)"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.705921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.643736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.512701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Urticaria","weight":0.454452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urticaria"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.364915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.327348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.229542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.152227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.12868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Telephone","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Alternative dispute resolution","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_dispute_resolution"}]}
