{"id":92614,"title":"Cell-based therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus.","abstract":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a female predominant autoimmune disease characterized by multi-organ disorders. The pathogenesis of SLE is complex. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are widely used to treat patients with SLE. However, these indiscriminate suppressors of the immune-mediated inflammatory aberration treat SLE at the cost of considerable adverse effects. Undoubtedly, there is a need for safer and more effective treatments for SLE. Cell-based therapies, although very much in their infancy, are of increasing interest in the treatment of SLE due to their potential for long-term suppression or a possible cure of the disease. Several immunoregulatory cell types, including regulatory T cells, mesenchymal stem cells, B-cells and natural killer cells, have recently been developed as novel products for tolerance-promoting therapies. Here, we provide a brief overview of current research of new cell-based therapeutic approaches that have undergone pre-clinical or clinical trials in the treatment of SLE.","date":"2015-01-22","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308529","annotations":[{"name":"Autoimmune disease","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.825383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Immunosuppressive drug","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.73345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.722756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Autoimmunity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmunity"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Natural killer cell","weight":0.701219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_killer_cell"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.659865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Regulatory T cell","weight":0.548381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.422564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.216664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.19899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Pre-clinical development","weight":0.0455169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-clinical_development"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Stipe (mycology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"}]}
