{"id":33739,"title":"The association between behavioural and emotional problems and age in adults with Down syndrome without dementia: Examining a wide spectrum of behavioural and emotional problems.","abstract":"The literature on the association between behavioural and emotional problems and ageing in adults with Down syndrome (DS) without dementia is limited and has generally not reported on a wide range of behavioural and emotional problems. This research aimed to extend the field by examining the associations between age and a wide spectrum of behavioural and emotional problems in adults with DS without dementia. A preliminary analysis of the association between potential covariates and behavioural and emotional problems was also undertaken. Parents and caregivers completed a questionnaire on behavioural and emotional problems for 53 adults with DS aged between 16 and 56 years. Twenty-eight adults with DS and their caregivers were part of a longitudinal sample, which provided two time points of data approximately four years apart. Additionally, 25 participants with DS and their caregivers were from a cross sectional sample, which provided one time point of data. Random effects regression analyses were used to examine the patterns in item scores for behavioural and emotional problems associated with age. No significant associations between age and the range or severity of any behavioural and emotional items were found. This suggested a more positive pattern for ageing adults with DS than has been previously described. Given that behavioural and emotional problems were not associated with age, investigation into other factors that may be associated with the behavioural and emotional difficulties for adults with DS is discussed.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24794290","annotations":[{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.654351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.444575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.355443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.272467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Longitudinal study","weight":0.220979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_study"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.162801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.0311921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Circle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Nintendo DS","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS"},{"name":"Cross-sectional study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Randomness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness"},{"name":"Cross","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Point (geometry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"}]}
