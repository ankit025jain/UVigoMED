{"id":58397,"title":"Effect of maternal intravenous fluid therapy on external cephalic version at term: a prospective cohort study.","abstract":"We sought to analyze whether maternal intravenous fluid therapy prior to external cephalic version (ECV) increases the amount of amniotic fluid and the success rate of the procedure.This was a prospective single-center cohort study of 200 women with a consecutive cohort of 100 pregnant women with a breech presentation at term who were administered intravenous fluid therapy with 2 L of hypotonic saline before the version attempt, compared to a control cohort of 100 pregnant women not given hydration treatment.The mean increase in the amniotic fluid index (AFI) after intravenous maternal hydration was 3.75 Â± 2.71 cm. The amount of fluid before hydration was the only variable found to be associated with increases in amniotic fluid levels, both in absolute and relative terms (odds ratio, -0.21; 95% confidence interval, -0.37 to -0.05 and odds ratio, -4.62; 95% confidence interval, -6.17 to -3.06; P < .01, respectively). We did not observe any severe complications secondary to the intravenous fluid therapy. The ECV success rate was 43% in the study group compared to 47% in the control group (P = .67). The success rate was significantly lower the larger the relative increase in the AFI, although no correlation was found in absolute terms (?(2) for linear trend = 0.03 and 0.34, respectively).Maternal intravenous fluid therapy with 2 L of hypotonic saline prior to ECV is an effective and safe technique for increasing the AFI. However, its use in ECV does not increase the success rate of the procedure.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24949536","annotations":[{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.922386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.784356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.65019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Breech birth","weight":0.576707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breech_birth"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.282524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.27611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.216279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid","weight":0.177274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid"},{"name":"Head","weight":0.13971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0634039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"AFI (band)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI_(band)"},{"name":"Intravenous fluid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_fluid"},{"name":"Tonicity","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"},{"name":"Amniotic fluid index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_fluid_index"},{"name":"External cephalic version","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_cephalic_version"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.0269705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Fluid replacement","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement"},{"name":"Charles Sanders Peirce","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Study group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group"},{"name":"Gluten-sensitive enteropathy associated conditions","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-sensitive_enteropathy_associated_conditions"},{"name":"Rehydration","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehydration"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Poverty threshold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
