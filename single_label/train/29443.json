{"id":29443,"title":"Alcohol consumption as a risk factor for sexual assault: a retrospective analysis.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to establish whether there is a correlation between alcohol consumption and reported sexual assaults among young people in the UK. A retrospective analysis of all cases between 01/05/2011 and 30/04/2012 involving complainants between the ages of 12 and 25 was carried out at the Lancashire SAFE Centre. In total 286 cases were included. Case notes were audited for evidence of alcohol consumption by the complainant in the 24 h prior to their assault. Further information regarding amount of alcohol consumed and any other drugs involved was also collected. In total it was found that 70.6% of complainants had consumed alcohol before being assaulted. This percentage was noted to vary with the complainant's age, ranging from 0% (age 12) to 100% (age 24). Of those who had consumed alcohol, complainants in 76.2% of cases had drunk more than the recommended daily alcohol intake, and almost a third had also taken drugs. There was only one case of suspected covert drug administration, and one forcible drug usage; in all other cases alcohol or drugs were taken voluntarily. Stranger rape (including where the complainant had known the assailant only briefly, such as meeting them the same day) was more common in complainants who had consumed alcohol. In summary, alcohol consumption often precedes sexual assaults among young people in the UK. This study therefore recommends the more widespread use of public awareness campaigns to highlight the risk of rape associated with excessive alcohol consumption.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661707","annotations":[{"name":"Assault","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.740145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.719038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.657861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Sexual assault","weight":0.632415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault"},{"name":"Human sexuality","weight":0.626731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.590836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Rape","weight":0.553954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.414255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Alcohol intoxication","weight":0.387328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.36118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.282524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.218004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Audit","weight":0.157879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Alcohol abuse","weight":0.115895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse"},{"name":"Plaintiff","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff"},{"name":"Secrecy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secrecy"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Lancashire","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Assassination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Water supply network","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_network"},{"name":"Home","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home"},{"name":"Public administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration"}]}
