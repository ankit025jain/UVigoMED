{"id":33343,"title":"Peripheral oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure during dental treatment of children with cyanotic congenital heart disease.","abstract":"In this observational study, we evaluated the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, and blood pressure of children with cyanotic congenital heart disease who were undergoing dental extraction.Forty-four patients between the ages of 6 and 12 years who underwent upper primary tooth extraction were included in the study. Of these, 20 patients were in the cyanotic congenital heart disease group and 24 were in the control group.Peripheral oxygen saturation, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure in the cyanotic congenital heart disease group varied quite significantly during the treatment protocol (p<0.05), with values of 80.5% (±7.6) to 82.8% (±7.8), 95.3 beats per minute (bpm) (±11.3) to 101.3 bpm (±9.8), and 93.6 mm Hg (±13,3) to 103.8 mm Hg (±12.7), respectively. The variations in the control group during the procedure were also significant.The changes observed during the study protocol, although statistically significant, were mild and lacked clinical relevance. The results indicate that dental treatment of children with cyanotic heart disease using a standardized protocol in decentralized offices without the support of a surgical center is safe.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838895","annotations":[{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.696211,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Dental extraction","weight":0.641101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"},{"name":"Oxygen saturation","weight":0.624413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.548787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Systole (medicine)","weight":0.532167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.498665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.497541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Cyanotic heart defect","weight":0.441284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotic_heart_defect"},{"name":"Cyanosis","weight":0.398292,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanosis"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.388124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Oxygenation (medical)","weight":0.363871,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygenation_(medical)"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.353711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.338413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.327927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Peripheral","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral"},{"name":"Saturated fat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat"}]}
