{"id":71565,"title":"Tamoxifen plus tegafur-uracil (TUFT) versus tamoxifen plus Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and cyclophosphamide (ACT) as adjuvant therapy to treat node-positive premenopausal breast cancer (PreMBC): results of Japan Clinical Oncology Group Study 9404.","abstract":"A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tamoxifen plus doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide compared to tamoxifen plus tegafur-uracil as an adjuvant therapy to treat node-positive premenopausal breast cancer (PreMBC).Eligibility criteria included pathologically node-positive (n = 1-9) preMBC with curative resection, in stages I-IIIA. Patients were randomized to receive either tamoxifen 20 mg/day plus tegafur-uracil 400 mg/day (TU) for 2 years or six courses of a 28-day cycle of doxorubicin 40 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 along with tamoxifen (ACT) given for 2 years as adjuvant therapy. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS).In total, 169 patients were recruited (TU arm 87, ACT arm 82) between October 1994 and September 1999. The HR for OS was 0.76 (95 % CI 0.35, 1.66, log-rank p = 0.49) and that for RFS was 0.77 (95 % CI 0.44, 1.36, log-rank p = 0.37), with ACT resulting in a better HR. The 5-year OS was 79.7 % for patients in the TU arm and 83 % for those in the ACT arm. The 5-year RFS was 66.1 % for patients in the TU arm and 70.6 % for those in the ACT arm. A higher proportion of patients in the ACT arm experienced grade 3 leucopenia (0 % in the TU arm, 4 % in the ACT arm).There were no significant differences in the efficacy of TU and ACT as adjuvant therapy.","date":"2014-08-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055938","annotations":[{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Leukopenia","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukopenia"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.740353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Adjuvant therapy","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.702154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.691498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.680043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.549876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.518886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.298346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.176249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Human resources","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"}]}
