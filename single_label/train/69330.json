{"id":69330,"title":"Correlation of low expression of hMOF with clinicopathological features of colorectal carcinoma, gastric cancer and renal cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Human MOF (males absent on the first), as a histone acetyltransferase, is responsible for histone H4K16 acetylation in human cells. Recent studies have shown that the abnormal gene expression of hMOF is involved in certain primary cancers. Here, we first report the involvement of hMOF expression in clinically diagnosed primary colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and gastric cancer. Simultaneously, the correlation of hMOF expression and clinicopathological features in CRC, gastric cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was analyzed. The hMOF mRNA expression was assessed in 44 CRC, 16 gastric cancer and 47 RCC human tissue samples by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Statistical analysis of qPCR data revealed a significant reduction (>2-fold decrease) of hMOF gene expression in CRC, 57% (25/44), 94% (15/16) in gastric cancer and 74% (35/47) in RCC tissues of the patients. In patients with CRC, lymph node metastasis and tumor stage were associated with hMOF expression patterns. However, no significant association between hMOF expression and tumor types emerged (p>0.05). Interestingly, in patients with gastric cancer, although no statistically significant difference was found between adjacent (<2 cm away from the cancer tissue) and normal tissues (>5 cm away from the cancer tissue), >2-fold reduction of hMOF expression in adjacent tissues had already appeared in 35% of patients. In addition, low expression of hMOF was strongly correlated with tumor differentiation (p<0.05) and survival of patients with gastric cancer (p<0.001). While in patients with RCC, downregulation of hMOF was connected to ccRCC and tissues with T1 tumor status. Our results suggest that downregulation of hMOF may be common in cancer tissues, and may represent a novel biomarker for tumor diagnosis.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24452485","annotations":[{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.905521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Acetylation","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylation"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.84243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.813157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.758148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.730425,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.72976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Real-time polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.676505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.619471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.501788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.423662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.374966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.286417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Histone acetyltransferase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_acetyltransferase"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
