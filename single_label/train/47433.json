{"id":47433,"title":"What are the latest pharmacotherapy options for small bowel adenocarcinoma?","abstract":"Incidence of small bowel adenocarcinoma is slowly but steadily increasing. As we gain more knowledge of the molecular basis of this disease, we may be able to approach it via using novel biologic or targeted therapies with or without traditional chemotherapy agents. In the meantime, early diagnosis is still best as it prompts early surgical resection and offers potential cure. The role of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy is currently being explored in clinical trials. Several clinical trials have suggested that first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic disease should consist of either 5-fluorouracil-leucovorin-oxalipatin or capecitabine-oxaliplatin, while 5-fluorouracil-leucovorin-irinotecan can be reserved for second-line treatment. However, we realize the limitations of these studies, given their small sample size and/or retrospective nature. Single-agent 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine should be considered in patients who are either intolerant to or experience significant side effects with oxaliplatin or irinotecan. We believe that cancers originating in the ampulla of Vater probably deserve a prospective randomized trial of cisplatin-gemcitabine, the current standard of therapy for advanced biliary malignancies.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24588646","annotations":[{"name":"Oxaliplatin","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin"},{"name":"Irinotecan","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan"},{"name":"Ampulla of Vater","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampulla_of_Vater"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.819013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.778612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.74597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Small intestine","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Ampulla","weight":0.735007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampulla"},{"name":"Targeted therapy","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.673217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.643484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.378771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.327797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Lactose intolerance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance"}]}
