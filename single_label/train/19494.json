{"id":19494,"title":"Pneumococcus in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples: the role of Aboriginal health workers and implications for nursing practice.","abstract":"Pneumonia is a common cause of hospitalization in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women.This article seeks to describe the importance of immunizing against pneumonia in Aboriginal Australians and suggest strategies for screening and follow-up.An integrative literature review, using both published and gray literature was undertaken to identify methods of screening and surveillance strategies for pneumococcus.The literature was summarized under the following themes: Pneumococcal disease; prevention strategies; access to care; improving access to vaccinations; culturally competent interventions and the role of Aboriginal health professionals.Community controlled conditions and the role of the Aboriginal Health Workers are seen as critical to reducing health disparities. Nurses can play a critical role in bridging the gap between mainstream and community controlled organizations. Working to increase the numbers of Aboriginal health professionals is a critical step in improving health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24716762","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumonia","weight":0.7721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.738087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Health equity","weight":0.522301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity"},{"name":"Health care provider","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_provider"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.471804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.451083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Australian Aborigines","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aborigines"},{"name":"Health Human Resources","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Human_Resources"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.254746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.175758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Indigenous Australians","weight":0.107269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Gray literature","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_literature"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Bridge","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge"},{"name":"Australia national cricket team","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team"},{"name":"Grey","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Nursing practice","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_practice"},{"name":"Torres Strait","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait"},{"name":"Torres Strait Islanders","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders"},{"name":"Mainstream","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream"},{"name":"Skill","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill"},{"name":"Working (musical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(musical)"},{"name":"Cultural competence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_competence"},{"name":"Health intervention","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_intervention"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"},{"name":"Integrative medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrative_medicine"}]}
