Radiologists must be cognizant of the vast variability of structures in the shoulder and of the incidental and postsurgical findings and artifacts affecting them.","date":"2014-08-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148153","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.561523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Cyst","weight":0.21971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.206001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.123231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Synovial bursa","weight":0.115291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_bursa"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Artifact (archaeology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)"},{"name":"Incidentaloma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidentaloma"},{"name":"Climate change","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Biceps brachii muscle","weight":0.0127068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biceps_brachii_muscle"}]}
