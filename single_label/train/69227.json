{"id":69227,"title":"Clinical impact of palliative treatment using octreotide for inoperable malignant bowel obstruction caused by advanced urological cancer.","abstract":"Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO), an occasional complication in patients with advanced urological cancer, causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting leading to suffering which severely impairs quality of life (QOL). Drug therapy, especially octreotide, a synthetic analog of somatostatin, is reportedly effective in controlling the symptoms of MBO. In the present study, we administered octreotide to urological cancer patients with MBO and evaluated the improvement of subjective symptoms, oral intake, and nasogastric intubation. Fourteen terminally ill urological cancer patients suffering with MBO were included (age range 55-92, 10 male, 4 female). Octreotide was administered at 300?g/day to those patients subcutaneously as a continuous injection. Significant improvements in subjective symptoms were observed in thirteen patients (92.8%), and ten patients (71.4%) were able to resume oral intake. Four patients required nasogastric drainage before the administration of octreotide, but nasogastric intubation was discontinued in all these cases after the use of octreotide. Early initiation of octreotide resulted in better improvement of MBO symptoms, and no adverse event was observed in any of the patients. These results revealed that 300?g/day dose of octreotide is safe and effective for managing gastrointestinal symptoms of terminally ill urological cancer patients with MBO. We also recommend starting the treatment with ocreotide as soon as MBO is diagnosed.
