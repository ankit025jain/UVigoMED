{"id":69685,"title":"GD2-targeted immunotherapy and radioimmunotherapy.","abstract":"Ganglioside GD2 is a tumor-associated surface antigen found in a broad spectrum of human cancers and stem cells. They include pediatric embryonal tumors (neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma), as well as adult cancers (small cell lung cancer, melanoma, soft tissue sarcomas). Because of its restricted normal tissue distribution, GD2 has been proven safe for antibody targeting. Anti-GD2 antibody is now incorporated into the standard of care for the treatment of high-risk metastatic neuroblastoma. Building on this experience, novel combinations of antibodies, cytokines, cells, and genetically engineered products all directed at GD2 are rapidly moving into the clinic. In this review, past and present immunotherapy trials directed at GD2 will be summarized, highlighting the lessons learned and the future directions.
