{"id":70455,"title":"Supporting women with advanced breast cancer: the impact of altered functional status on their social roles.","abstract":"Despite early detection of breast cancer and the progress of treatment modalities, metastasis-specific symptoms continue to impact women's functional status and daily living. The aim of this study was to explore the experience of altered functional status and social roles of women with advanced breast cancer. Using qualitative descriptive methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and altered functional status attending a tertiary care cancer centre. Results illustrated the adaptive experience of women living with their illness as they reshaped their social roles to fit with their altered functional status and advanced disease. These findings highlight the opportunity for supportive care nursing interventions to facilitate the behavioural and cognitive transitions that are experienced by women with advanced breast cancer and altered functional status. These results may have implications for women with other advanced chronic diseases, though more research is required.","date":"2014-09-05","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25189057","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cognition","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.723263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Nursing","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Activities of daily living","weight":0.480776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.474584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.447954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.383484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.281281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.20453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Qualitative research","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.102918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Gender role","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Linguistic description","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"}]}
