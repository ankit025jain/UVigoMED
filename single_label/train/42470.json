{"id":42470,"title":"Section 14. Combination of entecavir plus low-dose on-demand hepatitis B immunoglobulin is effective with very low hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation.","abstract":"Antiviral prophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) plus lamivudine reduces the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after HBV-related liver transplant (LT). However, HBIg is expensive, and lamivudine therapy is limited by drug resistance. This study assessed a pilot study of entecavir plus low-dose, on-demand HBIg in preventing HBV recurrence after LT.Between 2006 and May 2011, approximately 145 patients undergoing HBV-related LT and receiving entecavir plus low-dose, on-demand HBIg were enrolled and followed for a median of 36 months. A historical control group of 171 patients undergoing HBV-related LT between 1998 and 2010 and receiving lamivudine plus HBIg were followed for a median of 77 months. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with recurrent HBsAg-positivity.In the entecavir cohort, 2 (1.37%) of 145 patients experienced HBV recurrence, none of which had evidence of viral resistance. In the lamivudine cohort, 11 (6.4%) of 171 cases of HBV recurrence were observed, 5 of which were associated with lamivudine resistance. The cumulative probabilities of HBV recurrence were significantly different between both cohorts (P=0.055). HBsAg recurrence was associated with lower overall survival (P<0.001), even in patients with undetectable HBV DNA. Using pooled data from both cohorts, predictors of HBV recurrence were nucleoside selection, pre-LT hepatocellular carcinoma, post-LT low anti-HBs, male sex, and HBsAg-positivity in the explant liver tissue.Entecavir plus low-dose, on-demand HBIg resulted in a low rate of HBV recurrence without evidence of resistance development and provided an effective and cost-saving strategy for patients having HBV-related LT.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24849836","annotations":[{"name":"Lamivudine","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine"},{"name":"Hepatocellular carcinoma","weight":0.889412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Prophylaxis","weight":0.784186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophylaxis"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.766424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.751464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.74084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Nucleoside","weight":0.615348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside"},{"name":"Antiviral drug","weight":0.591549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.521151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.50565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.266385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.123495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.065098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Entecavir","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entecavir"},{"name":"HBsAg","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBsAg"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
