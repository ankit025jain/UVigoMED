{"id":47642,"title":"[Interleukin-32 expression in serum of patients with HBV-related liver failure and its significance].","abstract":"To investigate the expression level of IL-32 in serum and its correlation with serum biochemical indices of liver function test and HBV DNA load in patients with HBV-related liver failure.Fifty-five patients with HBV-related liver failure (severe hepatitis group) and twenty normal cases (control group) were enrolled in the study. Total RNA in PBMCs was extracted by using TRIzol. IL-32 mRNA level was assayed by using Real-time PCR. IL-32 protein level in serum was detected by ELSIA method. The correlation between IL-32 and ALT, AST, TBIL, HBV DNA load was analyzed using pearson's correlation analysis, respectively.Serum IL-32 expression level in severe hepatitis group was higher than that of control group. Moreover, the difference between them was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Serum IL-32 level was positively correlated with serum ALT, AST, TBIL, respectively (P < 0.05), but was not correlated with HBV DNA load (P > 0.05).Serum IL-32 expression level was increased in patients with HBV-related liver failure and was associated with the severity of inflammation. We, therefore, believe that IL-32 might be involved in the pathogenesis of HBV-related liver failure.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579465","annotations":[{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.879002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.804249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.702472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.626543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.392857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.363935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.352681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.295179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.208152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.183419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hepatitis B virus","weight":0.0977736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_virus"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
