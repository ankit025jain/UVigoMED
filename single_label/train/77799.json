{"id":77799,"title":"Improvement in symptoms and cochlear flow with pycnogenol in patients with Meniere's disease and tinnitus.","abstract":"The aim of this supplement registry was to evaluate the efficacy of the PycnogenolÂ® in improving cochlear flow and symptoms in a 6-month follow-up for patients with Meniere's disease (MD), tinnitus and cochlear hypoperfusion.Main signs/symptoms were considered: Spontaneous vertigo, positional vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, pressure in the ear, unsteady gait, associated clinical problems, alterations in daily life. All subjects were managed with the best available management (BM); one group used the supplement Pycnogenol (150 mg/day). Cochlear flow and tinnitus were also evaluated. Out of 120 patients incuded in the registry, 55 used Pycnogenol and 52 (controls) were managed only with BM.There was a more significant improvement in all registry items at 3 and 6 months in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). The number of lost working days was lower in the Pycnogenol group. At 3 months, 45.4% of subjects using Pycnogenol were completely asymptomatic in comparison with 23.07% of controls. At 6 months 87.3% of the Pycnogenol subjects were asymptomatic compared with 34.6% of controls. Cochlear flow velocity was significantly better (higher flow, higher diastolic component) in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). The subjective tinnitus scale decreased in both groups (P<0.05); the decrease was more significant in Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05) at 3 and 6 months.Symptoms of Meniere's disease, flow at cochlear level and tinnitus improved in Pycnogenol subjects in comparison with best management.","date":"2014-07-03","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24988090","annotations":[{"name":"Tinnitus","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus"},{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.676801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.63907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.638597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.621785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.547778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Ataxia","weight":0.520263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.255134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.247526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Dietary supplement","weight":0.229115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplement"},{"name":"Ear","weight":0.225149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear"},{"name":"Diastole","weight":0.223343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastole"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.208091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.186358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Velocity","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Doctor of Medicine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine"},{"name":"Proanthocyanidin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proanthocyanidin"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Positional notation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation"},{"name":"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Cochlear nerve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_nerve"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Main (river)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_(river)"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"},{"name":"Flow velocity","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_velocity"}]}
