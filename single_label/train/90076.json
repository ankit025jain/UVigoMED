{"id":90076,"title":"[Comparing clinical effects of titanic elastic nail and locking compression pine fixation in treating subtrochanteric fractures in older children].","abstract":"To explore optimal choice of surgical treatment for subtrochanteric fractures in older children.A retrospective study of 36 older children with subtrochanteric fractures was performed between January 2010 and January 2012. Among them, 18 patients (11 males and 7 females) aged from 7 to 13 years old with an average of 9.4 were treated with titanic elastic nail (TEN) fixation, 4 cases were Type II A, 3 cases were II B, 2 cases were II C, 4 cases were III A, 3 cases were III B according to Seinsheimer classification. Eighteen patients (10 males and 8 females) aged was from 8 to 13 years with an average of 9.6 were treated with locking compression pine (LCP) fixation, and 3 cases were Type II A, 4 cases were II B, 3 cases were II C, 4 cases were IIIA, 2 cases were III B. Fracture healing time, postoperative complications (including wound infection, failure and breakage of internal fixtion, deformities of angular on the sagittal view, deformities of coxa vara) and recovery of hip joint function were observed and recorded.All children were followed up from 15 to 36 months with an average of 21. Fracture were all healed, the time ranged from 7 to 16 weeks (mean 9.5). Three cases in TEN group occurred mild deformities of angular on the sagittal view, 3 cases occurred deformities of coxa vara and 2 cases occurred limb shortening; while 1 case occurred mild deformities of angular on the sagittal view, and no deformities of coxa vara and limb shortening occurred in LCP group. No early close of epiphyseal injury, avascular necrosis of femoral head occurred. Clinical efficacy were evaluated by Sanders standard, 14 cases got excellent results, 3 cases were moderate in LCP group, while 9 cases in excellent, 4 in moderate in TEN group. There were no significant differences between two group in recovery of hip joint function and complications.For the treatment of subtrochanteric fractures in older children,the efficacy of LCP fixation is better than that of TFN fixation, which has advantages of reliable fixation, and less complications.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and
