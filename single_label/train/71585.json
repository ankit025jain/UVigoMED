{"id":71585,"title":"Molecular imaging in oncology: (18)F-sodium fluoride PET imaging of osseous metastatic disease.","abstract":"This literature review details the history, pharmacokinetics, and utility of (18)F-sodium fluoride (Na(18)F) PET/CT in detecting osseous metastases compared with the current standard of care, technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-MDP) bone scintigraphy. Additional discussion highlights solutions to impediments for broader implementation of this modality and insight into the complementary roles of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and Na(18)F PET/CT in oncology imaging, including preliminary data for combined Na(18)F and FDG PET/CT.Na(18)F PET/CT is the most comprehensive imaging modality for the evaluation of osseous metastatic disease. Although further data acquisition is necessary to expand cost-benefit analyses of this imaging agent, emerging data reinforce its diagnostic advantage, suggest methods to mitigate impediments to broader utilization of Na(18)F PET/CT, and introduce a potentially viable technique for single-session combined Na(18)F and FDG PET/CT staging of soft-tissue and osseous disease.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055258","annotations":[{"name":"Technetium","weight":0.855339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.796849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Scintigraphy","weight":0.769954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintigraphy"},{"name":"Bone scintigraphy","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_scintigraphy"},{"name":"Fludeoxyglucose (18F)","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_(18F)"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.644114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.641092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.622971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.622488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.57819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Fluoride","weight":0.50524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"},{"name":"Bisphosphonate","weight":0.483395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphosphonate"},{"name":"Molecular imaging","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_imaging"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Methylenes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenes"},{"name":"Imaging agent","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_agent"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"Data acquisition","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_acquisition"},{"name":"Utility","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"}]}
