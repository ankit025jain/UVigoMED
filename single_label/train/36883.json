{"id":36883,"title":"Effect of dexmedetomidine on the corrected QT and Tp-e intervals during spinal anesthesia.","abstract":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on corrected QT (QTc) and Tp-e intervals in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia.We studied 50 patients who were scheduled to undergo spinal anesthesia before orthopedic surgeries. Patients were allocated to receive either an infusion of dexmedetomidine or normal saline after spinal anesthesia.QTc intervals were significantly prolonged after spinal anesthesia, and the prolonged QTc interval returned to baseline values 10 minutes after either normal saline or dexmedetomidine administration in both groups. The QTc interval values after dexmedetomidine administration were significantly shorter compared to the QTc interval values just before dexmedetomidine administration.Dexmedetomidine could promote the return of a prolonged QTc interval induced by spinal anesthesia and might be helpful in patients who have a prolonged QTc interval.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532526","annotations":[{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.72001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Spinal anaesthesia","weight":0.507177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_anaesthesia"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.4655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.200785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"QT interval","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QT_interval"},{"name":"Dexmedetomidine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexmedetomidine"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Infusion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Interval (music)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music)"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Q (New York City Subway service)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(New_York_City_Subway_service)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
