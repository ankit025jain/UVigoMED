{"id":63664,"title":"Sarcoid-like granulomatous reaction in renal cell carcinoma: report of a case with review of the published reports.","abstract":"A case of renal cell carcinoma with sarcoid-like granulomatous reaction within the tumor was reported. The granulomas were confined to the carcinoma while renal parenchyma and regional lymph nodes were completely free of involvement. Clinical workup of the patient did not reveal any evidence of sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or any other systemic disease except for diabetes mellitus. Sarcoid-like granulomatous reaction confined to renal carcinoma is a rare finding with only a few cases reported in the published reports.
