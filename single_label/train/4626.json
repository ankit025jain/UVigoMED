{"id":4626,"title":"Intratracheal administration of cyclooxygenase-1-transduced adipose tissue-derived stem cells ameliorates monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats.","abstract":"The effect of intratracheal administration of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)-modified adipose stem cells (ASCs) on monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension (MCT-PH) was investigated in the rat. The COX-1 gene was cloned from rat intestinal cells, fused with a hemagglutanin (HA) tag, and cloned into a lentiviral vector. The COX-1 lentiviral vector was shown to enhance COX-1 protein expression and inhibit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells without increasing apoptosis. Human ASCs transfected with the COX-1 lentiviral vector (ASCCOX-1) display enhanced COX-1 activity while exhibiting similar differentiation potential compared with untransduced (native) ASCs. PH was induced in rats with MCT, and the rats were subsequently treated with intratracheal injection of ASCCOX-1 or untransduced ASCs. The intratracheal administration of ASCCOX-1 3 Ã— 10(6) cells on day 14 after MCT treatment significantly attenuated MCT-induced PH when hemodynamic values were measured on day 35 after MCT treatment whereas administration of untransduced ASCs had no significant effect. These results indicate that intratracheally administered ASCCOX-1 persisted for at least 21 days in the lung and attenuate MCT-induced PH and right ventricular hypertrophy. In addition, vasodilator responses to the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside were not altered by the presence of ASCCOX-1 in the lung. These data emphasize the effectiveness of ASCCOX-1 in the treatment of experimentally induced PH.
