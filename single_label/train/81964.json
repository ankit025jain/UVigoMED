{"id":81964,"title":"Facial diplegia: a clinical dilemma.","abstract":"Bilateral facial paralysis is a rare clinical entity and presents as a diagnostic challenge. Unlike its unilateral counterpart facial diplegia is seldom secondary to Bell's palsy. Occurring at a frequency of 0.3% to 2% of all facial palsies it often indicates ominous medical conditions. Guillian-Barre syndrome needs to be considered as a differential in all given cases of facial diplegia where timely treatment would be rewarding. Here a case of bilateral facial palsy due to Guillian-Barre syndrome with atypical presentation is reported.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761505","annotations":[{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.809561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.468442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.4527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Facial nerve paralysis","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve_paralysis"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Entity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity"},{"name":"Differential (mechanical device)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Dilemma","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Diplegia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplegia"},{"name":"Palsy","weight":0.0142619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsy"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
