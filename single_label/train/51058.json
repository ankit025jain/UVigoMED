{"id":51058,"title":"Promising anti-diabetes mellitus activity in rats of ?-amyrin palmitate isolated from Hemidesmus indicus roots.","abstract":"While evaluating the toxicity of the tuberous root extracts of Hemidesmus indicus, a traditional medicinal plant, the glucose lowering property of the root was observed by the investigators. Therefore, it was thought of interest to isolate the anti-hyperglycemic principle from the root and determine its utility to develop an anti-diabetes mellitus medicine. The active principle was isolated from H. indicus root extract by anti-hyperglycemic activity guided chromatographic techniques. Glucose tolerance test in rats was used to evaluate the anti-hyperglycenic property. Anti-diabetes mellitus property was evaluated in alloxan-induced diabetic rats as well as streptozotocin-induced (type-2 model) diabetic rats. The active principle was isolated and identified with spectral data as ?-amyrin palmitate. Although it is a known compound, its presence in H. indicus is not known previously. It was observed for the first time that ?-amyrin palmitate has remarkable anti-hyperglycemic activity in orally glucose loaded rats. Further, interestingly, it exhibited excellent anti-diabetes mellitus activity in both alloxan-diabetic and streptozotocin-diabetic rats at a very low concentration (50Âµg/kg body weight). One of the mechanisms of action of ?-amyrin palmitate appears to be blocking the entry of glucose from the intestine. ?-Amyrin palmitate is very promising to develop a medicine for diabetes for combination therapy and/or mono-therapy.
