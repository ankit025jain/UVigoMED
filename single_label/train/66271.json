{"id":66271,"title":"Genes involved in the regulation of vascular homeostasis determine renal survival rate in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis.","abstract":"Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) is one of the most severe kidney diseases. Genes of vascular reactivity are thought to play an important role in development and progression of CGN. In this study, we analyzed association of genes of vascular homeostasis with hypertension and renal survival of CGN patients. The study sample included 238 patients with CGN and 304 healthy subjects of population control. Ten polymorphisms of ten genes of vascular homeostasis were genotyped through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and TaqMan assays. Association of the genotypes with renal survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Genotypes 311SC and 311SS of the PON2 gene, (-1166)AC and (-1166)CC of the AGTR1 gene, (+46)AA of the ADRB2 gene, and 198KK and 198KN of the EDN1 gene were associated with decreased rate of renal survival of the patients. Polymorphisms S311C PON2, (-1166)A/C AGTR1, (+46)G/A ADRB2, and K198N EDN1 were associated with the accelerated decline in kidney function in the CGN patients.","date":"2014-06-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24727057","annotations":[{"name":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.790327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.709053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Glomerulonephritis","weight":0.702784,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomerulonephritis"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.586164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Renal function","weight":0.540434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function"},{"name":"TaqMan","weight":0.415136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaqMan"},{"name":"Smooth muscle tissue","weight":0.339283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_muscle_tissue"},{"name":"Genotyping","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.121176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.112894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Restriction enzyme","weight":0.102966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.0902143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.079122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Angiotensin II receptor type 1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II_receptor_type_1"},{"name":"Human population control","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_population_control"},{"name":"Beta-2 adrenergic receptor","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor"},{"name":"Restriction fragment","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_fragment"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Schutzstaffel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel"},{"name":"South Carolina","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"},{"name":"Georgia (U.S. state)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
