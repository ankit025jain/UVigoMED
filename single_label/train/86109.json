{"id":86109,"title":"Dietary advanced glycation end-products, its pulmonary receptor, and high mobility group box 1 in aspiration lung injury.","abstract":"Gastric aspiration is a significant cause of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Environmental risk factors, such as a diet high in proinflammatory advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), may render some patients more susceptible to lung injury after aspiration. We hypothesized that high dietary AGEs increase its pulmonary receptor, RAGE, producing an amplified pulmonary inflammatory response in the presence of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a RAGE ligand and an endogenous signal of epithelial cell injury after aspiration.CD-1 mice were fed either a low AGE or high AGE diet for 4 wk. After aspiration injury with acidified small gastric particles, bronchoalveolar lavage and whole-lung tissue samples were collected at 5 min, 1 h, 5 h, and 24 h after injury. RAGE, soluble RAGE (sRAGE), HMGB1, cytokine and chemokine concentrations, albumin levels, neutrophil influx, and lung myeloperoxidase activity were measured.We observed that high AGE-fed mice exhibited greater pulmonary RAGE levels before aspiration and increased bronchoalveolar lavage sRAGE levels after aspiration compared with low AGE-fed mice. Lavage HMGB1 levels rose immediately after aspiration, peaking at 1 h, and strongly correlated with sRAGE levels in both dietary groups. High AGE-fed mice demonstrated higher cytokine and chemokine levels with increased pulmonary myeloperoxidase activity over 24 h versus low AGE-fed mice.This study indicates that high dietary AGEs can increase pulmonary RAGE, augmenting the inflammatory response to aspiration in the presence of endogenous damage signals such as HMGB1.","date":"2014-08-15","categories":"Respiratory Tract
