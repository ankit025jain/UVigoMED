{"id":24010,"title":"Identification of Scopulariopsis species by partial 28S rRNA gene sequence analysis.","abstract":"The genus Scopulariopsis contains over 30 species of mitosporic moulds, which although usually saprophytic may also act as opportunistic pathogens in humans. They have mainly been associated with onychomycosis, and only sporadically reported as a cause of deep tissue infections or systemic disease. Identification of Scopulariopsis species still largely relies on phenotype-based methods. There is a need for a molecular diagnostic approach, that would allow to reliably discriminate between different Scopulariopsis species. The aim of this study was to apply sequence analysis of partial 28S rRNA gene for species identification of Scopulariopsis clinical isolates. Although the method employed did reveal some genetic polymorphism among Scopulariopsis isolates tested, it was not enough for species delineation. For this to be achieved, other genetic loci, within and beyond the rDNA operon, need to be investigated.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459837","annotations":[{"name":"Saprotrophic nutrition","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprotrophic_nutrition"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.823615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Operon","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operon"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Opportunistic infection","weight":0.781424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.77821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.760806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Genetic polymorphism","weight":0.756958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_polymorphism"},{"name":"Sequence analysis","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_analysis"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Genus","weight":0.700925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.698754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.575724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.375617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.362283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Mold","weight":0.203202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mold"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Onychomycosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychomycosis"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Massage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage"},{"name":"Language isolate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate"},{"name":"Forensic identification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification"},{"name":"28S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Fungi imperfecti","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi_imperfecti"}]}
