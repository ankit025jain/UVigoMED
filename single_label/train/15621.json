{"id":15621,"title":"Assessment of knowledge, attitude and practice about leprosy among patients and their families in a rural community in Tamil Nadu.","abstract":"Leprosy as a social disease has been a major public health problem because of the social stigma and ignorance attached to it. This has made it difficult for our health care delivery system in their pursuit for early diagnosis and prompt treatment. This study was done with the objective of assessing the present knowledge, attitude and practice of leprosy affected persons and their family members in a rural setting. This cross sectional study was conducted by using a pre tested, structured questionnaire among 100 registered Leprosy patients and 100 adult members of patient's family in Thiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu. Data collected was analyzed and results were summarized in percentages and presented in tables. About 32% of the patients and 37% of family members were aware that leprosy is caused by a germ. Skin patches and loss of sensation as symptoms of Leprosy were known to 55% of patients and 73% of the family members. 84% of Patients and 64% family members said that leprosy was curable. About 90% of the patients and 82% of the family members stated that deformities can be prevented by early and regular treatment. The patients showed a negative attitude after contracting the disease. Most of the family members (73%) did not share articles used by patients. 91% of the family members felt leprosy patients can be employable. About 45% the family members opined that a cured leprosy patient can marry. About 90% of the patients participated in social functions and 64% didn't hesitate to take food along with others. All family members were found to be willing to support their leprosy affected relatives. This study revealed inconsistency and deficiencies in the knowledge, attitude and practice among the leprosy affected patients and their family members. The patients and family members had adequate average level of knowledge about leprosy, but their attitude toward the disease and their practices were not adequately favorable.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
