{"id":92751,"title":"Randomized split-face controlled study to evaluate 1550-nm fractionated erbium glass laser for treatment of acne vulgaris--an image analysis evaluation.","abstract":"Novel and promising results in acne treatment with infrared lasers have been reported. The 1,550-nm erbium glass laser is one of the infrared lasers that may be useful in the treatment of acne.The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an erbium glass laser in treatment of active acne and to study the effect of this type of laser on sebaceous glands.Twenty-four patients with active acne lesions were treated using 1,550-nm (30-40 mJ) fractional erbium glass laser. Every patient received 4 sessions with a 2-week interval. Follow-up was done every 3 months for 1 year. The image analyzer computer system was used to measure the sebaceous gland size.A significant reduction (p < .0001) in the mean count of lesions was observed after treatment and in the follow-up period. A significant reduction in the size of sebaceous glands was also evident after laser treatment.Treatment of active acne with the 1,550-nm erbium glass laser is effective. Papules, pustules, and nodules all respond well to therapy. The sebaceous gland size decreased significantly, which accounts for the long remission period.","date":"2014-10-28","categories":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310750","annotations":[{"name":"Sebaceous gland","weight":0.890083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_gland"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.705965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.644708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Acne","weight":0.538235,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.501749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.48121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.44584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.328042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.294566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.282845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.224581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.106477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Joule","weight":0.0603641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule"},{"name":"Glass","weight":0.0557163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Erbium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbium"},{"name":"Image analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_analysis"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"1550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1550"},{"name":"550","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/550"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Far-infrared laser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-infrared_laser"},{"name":"Nodule (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)"},{"name":"Laser surgery","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_surgery"},{"name":"Analyser","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analyser"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Commodore 4040","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_4040"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"}]}
