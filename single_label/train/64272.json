{"id":64272,"title":"Filaggrin loss-of-function mutations are associated with food allergy in childhood and adolescence.","abstract":"Filaggrin is an epidermal protein that has a role in skin barrier function. Filaggrin loss-of-function (FLG-LOF) mutations are a significant risk factor for eczema and atopy, but their association with food allergy (FA) is less clear.We explored the longitudinal relationship between 3 common FLG-LOF mutations and FA using the Isle of Wight birth cohort.FA diagnosis was based on recognized allergic reactions within 4 hours after exposure to known food allergens. Food allergen sensitization (FAS) was identified by using skin prick tests conducted between 1 and 18 years of age to a range of food allergens. Three FLG mutations were genotyped in 1150 (79%) of 1456 children. The temporal relationships between FA, FAS, and eczema in children with FLG mutations were explored by using path analysis with total, direct, and indirect effect models.There was a significant total effect of FLG-LOF mutations on the risk of FA in later childhood at the ages of 10 (odds ratio, 31.46; 95% CI, 2.86 to >100) and 18 (odds ratio, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.55-11.61) years. Path analysis showed that there was no direct effect of FLG-LOF mutations on FA at any age; however, an indirect effect was found on FA at all ages through eczema and FAS in the earlier years.FLG-LOF mutations are associated with FA in older children through eczema and FAS during early childhood. Our results highlight a biologically plausible pathway, which suggests that skin barrier function is important in the development and persistence of FA.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174864","annotations":[{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.865304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Eczema","weight":0.863472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.80183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Atopy","weight":0.776726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.632809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.546441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.456857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.34725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Filaggrin","weight":0.146135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filaggrin"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Isle of Wight","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"1456","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1456"},{"name":"1150","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1150"},{"name":"The Football Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Direct effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_effect"},{"name":"Indirect effect","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_effect"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Barrier function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_function"},{"name":"Persistence (computer science)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)"},{"name":"Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Education_Agency_accountability_ratings_system"},{"name":"Biological plausibility","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_plausibility"},{"name":"C.D.
