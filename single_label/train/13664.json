{"id":13664,"title":"Evaluation of serum phosphorylated neurofilament subunit NF-H as a prognostic biomarker in dogs with thoracolumbar intervertebral disc herniation.","abstract":"To investigate whether pNF-H is a prognostic biomarker of spinal cord injury (SCI) in paraplegic dogs with thoracolumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IVDH).Prospective, case-control clinical studyDogs (n = 60) with SCI from IVDH and 6 healthy dogs.Serum from 60 thoracolumbar IVDH dogs (Grade 4: 22 dogs; Grade 5: 38 dogs) collected 1-3 days after injury, and 6 control dogs, was analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a phosphorylated form of the high-molecular-weight neurofilament subunit NF-H (pNF-H). Serum pNF-H levels were compared between different IVDH grades and their prognostic value was investigated.pNF-H levels were significantly greater in Grade 5 than Grade 4 dogs. There were significant differences in pNF-H levels between dogs that regained voluntarily ambulation and those that did not. All 8 dogs that had high pNF-H levels 1-3 days after injury did not regain the ability to walk after surgery.Serum pNF-H levels might be a biomarker for predicting prognosis of canine SCI.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467275","annotations":[{"name":"Intervertebral disc","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc"},{"name":"Paraplegia","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraplegia"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.825578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Spinal cord","weight":0.785624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.777151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.74922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.549413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.547778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.46926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.330524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0818325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Neurofilament","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofilament"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Protein subunit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit"},{"name":"Fifth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_grade"},{"name":"Fourth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_grade"},{"name":"Lateral horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Umbilical cord","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
