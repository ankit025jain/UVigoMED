{"id":80813,"title":"[Tungiasis, an emerging tropical disease in Chile: three imported cases reports].","abstract":"Tungiasis is a cutaneous ectoparasitosis caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans whose higher prevalence occurs in South America, the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. It is clinically characterized by a papular lesion, either single or multiple, with a whitish halo and a brown-black central core, most of them localized on the feet. The lesions can be painful and itchy with the most common complication being bacterial superinfection of the skin. We report three cases of Chilean patients who presented skin lesions suggestive of tungiasis on their return from areas of high prevalence of the disease. The diagnosis is made by the clinical features of lesions in a patient from an endemic zone. Standard treatment consists of surgical extraction of the flea followed by application of a topical antibiotic and a tetanus prophylaxis. Prevention of the infestation is essential and includes the use of closed footwear and repellents.
