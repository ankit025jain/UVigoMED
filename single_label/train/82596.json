{"id":82596,"title":"Effect of proanthocyanidin treatment on the bonding effectiveness of adhesive restorations in pulp chamber.","abstract":"To analyze the effect of proanthocyanidin (PA) treatment of the pulp chamber dentin after NaOCl and EDTA irrigation on the microleakage and interfacial morphology of adhesive restorations.Pulp chambers of 66 extracted permanent molars were exposed. In half of the samples, pulp chamber dentin was bonded with Clearfil S3 after irrigation with normal saline (Group1a); 1% NaOCl and 17% EDTA (Group1b) or 1% NaOCl, 17% EDTA and 30% PA (Group1c) and in other half samples, pulp chamber dentin was bonded with Futurabond NR after irrigation with normal saline (Group 2a); 1% NaOCl and 17% EDTA (Group 2b) or 1% NaOCl, 17% EDTA and 30% PA (Group 2c). After adhesive procedures, Filtek Z 250 restorations were placed in the pulp chambers. Microleakage assessment was done in ten samples from each group and scanning electron microscopic examination was done in one sample from each group. Statistical analysis was done using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests at a significance level of P<0.05.Both the adhesives showed extensive microleakage. NaOCl and EDTA irrigation had no significant effect on the microleakage of both the adhesives. PA treatment of the pulp chamber dentin after NaOCl and EDTA irrigation significantly reduced microleakage in both the adhesives.It was concluded that 1 minute application of 30% proanthocyanidin solution in the pulp chamber after NaOCl and EDTA irrigation improved the subsequent bonding of self-etch adhesives to pulp chamber dentin.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24579283","annotations":[{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.648886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Molar (tooth)","weight":0.575603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.453845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.356148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.349433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid","weight":0.316559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.289764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Microscope","weight":0.269552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope"},{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.255301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.238329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Irrigation","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Chemical bond","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"},{"name":"List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_2B_carcinogens"},{"name":"Proanthocyanidin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proanthocyanidin"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Atomic number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Chamber music","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music"},{"name":"Surface normal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal"},{"name":"Pulp (paper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(paper)"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Pulp (band)","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(band)"},{"name":"Bicameralism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism"},{"name":"Interface (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Pulp (tooth)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)"},{"name":"Sodium hypochlorite","weight":0.0129848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite"}]}
