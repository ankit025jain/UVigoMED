{"id":88488,"title":"Temporal effect of in vivo tendon fatigue loading on the apoptotic response explained in the context of number of fatigue loading cycles and initial damage parameters.","abstract":"Accumulation of damage is a leading factor in the development of tendinopathy. Apoptosis has been implicated in tendinopathy, but the biological mechanisms responsible for initiation and progression of these injuries are poorly understood. We assessed the relationship between initial induced damage and apoptotic activity 3 and 7 days after fatigue loading. We hypothesized that greater apoptotic activity (i) will be associated with greater induced damage and higher number of fatigue loading cycles, and (ii) will be higher at 7 than at 3 days after loading. Left patellar tendons were fatigue loaded for either 100 or 7,200 cycles. Diagnostic tests were applied before and after fatigue loading to determine the effect of fatigue loading on hysteresis, elongation, and loading and unloading stiffness (damage parameters). Cleaved Caspase-3 staining was used to identify and calculate the percent apoptosis in the patellar tendon. While no difference in apoptotic activity occurred between the 100 and 7,200 cycle groups, greater apoptotic activity was associated with greater induced damage. Apoptotic activity was higher at 7 than 3 days after loading. We expect that the decreasing number of healthy cells that can repair the induced damage in the tendon predispose it to further injury.","date":"2014-07-21","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24838769","annotations":[{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.743507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.714275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.706065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.555837,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.484519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.34455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.164972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Stiffness","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness"},{"name":"Hysteresis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis"},{"name":"Tendinitis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinitis"},{"name":"Patellar ligament","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_ligament"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Left-wing politics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Initiation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Cleavage (geology)","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleavage_(geology)"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"Biological process","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process"}]}
