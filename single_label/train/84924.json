{"id":84924,"title":"The one-carbon-cycle and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism in recurrent major depressive disorder; influence of antidepressant use and depressive state?","abstract":"An important biological factor suggested in the pathophysiology of (recurrent) Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) concerns a polymorphism in a gene encoding for the MTHFR-enzyme of the one-carbon (1-C)-metabolism. Integratively investigating key 1-C-components (folate, homocysteine, vitamin B6 and B12), including the possible effects of antidepressant medication and depressive state, could provide more insight in the possible association between the MTHFR-polymorphism and recurrent MDD.We compared the MTHFR C677T-polymorphism together with the key 1-C-components in clinically ascertained patients with recurrent MDD (n=137) to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n=73).First, patients had lower folate (t=2.25; p=.025) as compared to controls; a difference that resolved after correction for demographics (t=1.22; p=.223). Second, patients that were depressed during sampling had lower vitamin B6 (t=-2.070; p=.038) and higher homocysteine (t=2.404; p=.016) compared to those in remission. Finally, current use of antidepressants had no influence on the 1-C-components.Despite investigation of a specific recurrently depressed patient population, we found no clear associations with the 1-C-cycle, except for higher homocysteine and lower vitamin B6 during the depressed state. This suggests that 1-C-cycle alterations in MDD are state-associated, possibly resulting from high levels of acute (psychological) stress, and may provide a treatment target to reduce cardiovascular risk in this population.","date":"2014-07-11","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25012419","annotations":[{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.890037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.86097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Antidepressant","weight":0.818834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Folic acid","weight":0.811345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Homocysteine","weight":0.796832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine"},{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.754889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Vitamin B12","weight":0.743651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.700011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.683758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pathophysiology","weight":0.644811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.524473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.50668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.469872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.46068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase","weight":0.325507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Insight","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
