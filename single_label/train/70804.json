{"id":70804,"title":"The lncRNA-MYC regulatory network in cancer.","abstract":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely studied in recent years, and accumulating evidence identified lncRNAs as crucial regulators of various biological processes, including cell cycle progression, chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, and posttranscriptional processing. In addition, the fact that lncRNAs interact with the MYC gene family in human carcinomas has been discovered. This review summarizes the latest progress on the investigation of lncRNAs and MYC, particularly focusing on the interplay between lncRNAs and MYC in cancer to reveal the significance of lncRNA-MYC network in regulating initiation, development, and metastasis of tumors. Further research and collection of clinical data would provide a better understanding of lncRNA-MYC network in cancer diagnosis and treatment.","date":"2014-10-30","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139102","annotations":[{"name":"Chromatin","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Gene family","weight":0.697707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_family"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.648561,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Systems biology","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.562005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.397191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Myc","weight":0.369646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myc"},{"name":"Chromatin remodeling","weight":0.368384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin_remodeling"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Biological process","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_process"},{"name":"Protein-protein interaction","weight":0.294193,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein-protein_interaction"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.286358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Post-transcriptional modification","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transcriptional_modification"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Bone remodeling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_remodeling"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"}]}
