{"id":26242,"title":"[Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging].","abstract":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) evolves and is occupying an important status in cardiovascular diagnostic imaging. In particular, in the estimation of the cause of heart failure, or evaluation of severity-of-illness and prognostic presumption, utility is high clinically. In this chapter, about a selection sequence for taking image according to the purpose, description of findings, and its clinical utility are introduced. And the role which this imaging plays will be discussed in the near future.
