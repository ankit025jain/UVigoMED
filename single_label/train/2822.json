{"id":2822,"title":"[Benefits of Iris Claw lens implantation among present methods of surgical correction of aphakia with insufficient capsular support].","abstract":"Both anatomical and functional benefits associated with the implantation of intraocular lenses are the basis for the use of multiple surgical methods in intraocular lens surgery. To achieve adequate stability of the intraocular lens in cases of insufficient capsular support one may choose angle-supported anterior chamber intraocular lenses, iris-fixated intraocular lenses, iris-sutured or transsclerally sutured posterior chamber intraocular lenses. The transscleral IOL stabilization, most commonly used in clinical practice, seems particularly valuable in eyes with decreased corneal endothelial cell density, shallow anterior chamber, anatomical abnormalities of the iris and iridocorneal angle and uncontrolled glaucoma. Angle-supported anterior chamber IOLs, although easy to implant, can result in excessive endothelial cell loss or secondary glaucoma. Fixated to the midperipherial iris the Iris Claw lens seems to be an interesting and increasingly more popular alternative to other surgical methods used for cases of insufficient capsular support. The paper discusses some aspects of clinical and technical Iris Claw lens implantation in the correction of aphakia.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345297","annotations":[{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.872951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.852481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Anterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Posterior chamber of eyeball","weight":0.794376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_chamber_of_eyeball"},{"name":"Iris (anatomy)","weight":0.78676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Aphakia","weight":0.411303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphakia"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.249941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sex reassignment surgery","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}]}
