{"id":81916,"title":"The state-of-the-art of ART sealants.","abstract":"Sealing caries-prone pits and fissure systems is an effective caries-preventive measure. There are basically two types of sealant materials: glass-ionomer and resin-based materials. Low- and medium-viscosity glass-ionomers were initially used and showed a low level of retention. With the advent of the ART approach in the mid-nineties, high-viscosity glass-ionomers were introduced as sealant material and the retention rate of ART sealants increased substantially. As the effectiveness of a sealant is measured by its capacity to prevent (dentine) carious lesion development, sealant retention is considered a surrogate endpoint. The ART sealant protocol is described. Systematic reviews and meta-analysis covering low- medium- and high-viscosity glass-ionomer (ART) sealants have concluded that there is no evidence that either glass-ionomer or resin-based sealants prevent dentine carious lesions better. The annual dentine carious lesion development in teeth with high-viscosity glass-ionomer ART sealants over the first three years is 1%. These ART sealants have a high capacity of preventing carious lesion development. Because no electricity and running water is required, ART sealants can be placed both inside and outside the dental surgery.High-viscosity glass-ionomer ART sealants can be used alongside resin-based sealants.41:119-124","date":"2014-05-02","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783880","annotations":[{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.557965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.502939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.462302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.33773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.27397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Electricity","weight":0.262436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.17769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.159055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Dentin","weight":0.146475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"},{"name":"Surrogate endpoint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_endpoint"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Antiretroviral drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_drug"},{"name":"Coal mining","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining"},{"name":"Tap water","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_water"},{"name":"Retention rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_rate"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Dental sealant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_sealant"},{"name":"Seal hunting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Systematics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics"},{"name":"Fissure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissure"},{"name":"Surrogacy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy"},{"name":"Sealant","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealant"}]}
