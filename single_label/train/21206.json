{"id":21206,"title":"Rickettsia africae and Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae in ticks in Israel.","abstract":"DNA of several spotted fever group rickettsiae was found in ticks in Israel. The findings include evidence for the existence of Rickettsia africae and Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae in ticks in Israel. The DNA of R. africae was detected in a Hyalomma detritum tick from a wild boar and DNA of C. Rickettsia barbariae was detected in Rhipicephalus turanicus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus collected from vegetation. The DNA of Rickettsia massiliae was found in Rh. sanguineus and Haemaphysalis erinacei, whereas DNA of Rickettsia sibirica mongolitimonae was detected in a Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus. Clinicians should be aware that diseases caused by a variety of rickettsiae previously thought to be present only in other countries outside of the Middle East may infect residents of Israel who have not necessarily traveled overseas. Furthermore, this study reveals again that the epidemiology of the spotted fever group rickettsiae may not only involve Rickettsia conorii but may include other rickettsiae.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615133","annotations":[{"name":"Rickettsia","weight":0.834308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickettsia"},{"name":"Tick","weight":0.818951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.798286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Middle East","weight":0.705646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Wild boar","weight":0.541289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.510359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Israel","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"},{"name":"Rhipicephalus sanguineus","weight":0.332024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhipicephalus_sanguineus"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Hyalomma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyalomma"},{"name":"Haemaphysalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemaphysalis"},{"name":"Rickettsia sibirica","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickettsia_sibirica"},{"name":"Vegetation","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation"},{"name":"Boutonneuse fever","weight":0.0200356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boutonneuse_fever"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Rh blood group system","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_blood_group_system"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"East Asia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Rhipicephalus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhipicephalus"},{"name":"Candidatus","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidatus"}]}
