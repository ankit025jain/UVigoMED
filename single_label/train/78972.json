{"id":78972,"title":"Finding friends online: online activities by deaf students and their well-being.","abstract":"Generally, deaf and hard of hearing (D/HH) children have fewer friends than hearing peers and their friendships are of a lower quality. The research hypothesis was that using the computer to communicate with new online friends through social network sites or playing games with offline friends is associated with D/HH friendship qualities, because it removes certain communication barriers D/HH face in offline communication settings. With online questionnaires the relation between computer use and online, mixed (offline friend who you also speak in online settings), and offline friendship quality of D/HH and hearing students (18-25 years) was compared in both the Netherlands (n = 100) and the United States (n = 122). In addition, the study examined whether the different friendship qualities were related to the participants' well-being. Results showed that, in general, D/HH students' friendship qualities and levels of well-being were similar to their hearing peers. The quality of the mixed friendships was positively related to well-being. Furthermore, the frequency of pc use with both online and offline friends was positively related to friendships qualities in both hearing and D/HH students. A combination of the online and offline friendship seems to be the most important friendship type for both hearing and D/HH students and it is worthwhile to encourage this friendship type.","date":"2014-02-12","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520373","annotations":[{"name":"Communication","weight":0.824983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.760642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Social network","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.715553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Netherlands","weight":0.62554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"},{"name":"Social networking service","weight":0.60073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.512627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Online and offline","weight":0.375424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Friendship","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship"},{"name":"Computer network","weight":0.155867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"},{"name":"Computing","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Computer-assisted web interviewing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_web_interviewing"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Parsec","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec"},{"name":"Peer-to-peer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer"},{"name":"1825","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1825"},{"name":"Internet relationship","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_relationship"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"DHH (hedgehog)","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHH_(hedgehog)"},{"name":"Mixed-sex education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_education"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Language barrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_barrier"}]}
