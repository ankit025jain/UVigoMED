{"id":43349,"title":"Hepatic explant pathology of pediatric intestinal transplant recipients previously treated with omega-3 fatty acid lipid emulsion.","abstract":"To evaluate and compare the biochemical and histologic effect of parenteral fish oil lipid emulsion that is rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3FAs), Omegaven (Fresenius Kabi AG, Bad Homburg, Germany) with standard omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (O6FA) parenteral nutrition.Comparison of hepatic explant pathology and biochemical outcome on pediatric patients with intestinal failure treated with either parental O3FA or O6FA who had received a liver-inclusive intestine transplant.Seven liver-inclusive intestinal transplants were performed in 7 patients who received O3FA for a mean of 62% ± 13% of total patient life-span (16.1 ± 7.0 months) before transplant. Median total bilirubin fell from 6.9 mg/dL at the start of treatment to 0.7 mg/dL at the time transplant (P < .02), which was a significant decrease compared with the similarly matched O6FA cohort (P = .012). All 7 of the 03FA-treated patients received a liver-inclusive intestinal transplant had advanced fibrosis (stage 3 or 4) noted on explant pathologic examination, despite a resolution of cholestasis at the time of transplant. Histologic inflammatory scores were lower (P = .056) in the 03FA group with similar degrees of advanced fibrosis as in the O6FA group.In a matched comparison of patients undergoing intestinal transplantation with a history of extended O3FA lipid emulsion therapy that successfully reversed hyperbilirubinemia, significant hepatic fibrosis was present in the explanted livers despite a reduction in inflammation. This result confirms concern that the use of O3FA may have a limited role in altering the development of hepatic fibrosis from parenteral nutrition.","date":"2014-06-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793206","annotations":[{"name":"Omega-6 fatty acid","weight":0.912099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid"},{"name":"Bilirubin","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin"},{"name":"Fatty acid","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.795008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Parenteral nutrition","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.758635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.7346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Fish oil","weight":0.701571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_oil"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.694587,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cholestasis","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholestasis"},{"name":"Liver function tests","weight":0.648635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.624413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.583441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Fish","weight":0.563085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.556565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fat","weight":0.506144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.486072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.350018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.341888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Parenteral","weight":0.331433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral"},{"name":"Polyunsaturated fatty acid","weight":0.270612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fatty_acid"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.174371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.125021,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Hyperbilirubinemia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbilirubinemia"},{"name":"Bad Homburg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Homburg"},{"name":"International standard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"The Football Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"}]}
