{"id":86299,"title":"[Triptolide inhibits cell proliferation by downregulating phosphorylation of estrogen reporters in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice].","abstract":"In order to investigate the anti-proliferative effects of triptolide (TP) on 4T1 mice breast cancer cell line in vitro and in mouse model, as well as the possible mechanisms, we detected the effect of TP on cell proliferation by MTT assay or Crystal Violet Staining in our research. Flowcytometry combined with FITC-Annexin V/PI staining were used for detecting TP induced 4T1 cell apoptosis. The protein expression of ERalpha, p-ERalpha, ERbeta, p-ERbeta, ERK, p-ERK, p38, p-p38, SAPK/JNK, and p-SAPK/JNK was tested by western blotting. We also compare TP with chemotherapy drug doxorubicin in 4T1 tumor bearing BLAB/c mice model, the Xenogen bioluminescence imaging, H&E, and IHC result indicated that TP exhibits an anticancer proliferation activity. As a result, TP in 100, 10, 1, 0.1 micromol x L(-1), all inhibited the proliferation of 4T1 cells by MTT assay and Crystal Violet Staining. TP which concentrations is 10, 1, 0.1 micromol x L(-1) could induce the apoptosis of 4T1 cells and reduce the cell proliferation. TP in 200 microg x kg(-1) could inhibit the tumor growth in vivo. The anticancer proliferation of TP was involved in its effect on reducing expression of ERalpha, p-ERalpha, ERbeta, and p-ERbeta, but nothing to do with the activation of MAPK signaling pathway.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Respiratory Tract
