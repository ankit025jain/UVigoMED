{"id":89417,"title":"Fragility fractures requiring special consideration: pelvic insufficiency fractures.","abstract":"Fractures of the pelvis and acetabulum in osteoporotic bone represent an important subset of fragility fractures. Pelvic fractures in the elderly patient carry a significant 1-year mortality risk, comparable to that of hip fractures. Patients often lose their ability to function independently in the community. In this group, treatment of their bone density is essential to reducing their risk of further fractures. A thorough discussion of the likely course of recovery, the prolonged need for pain medications, and the risks and benefits of intervention can help patients and their families cope with the disability.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721375","annotations":[{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.572841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.553859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.540498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.5387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.513077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.46404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Analgesic","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic"},{"name":"Bone density","weight":0.271109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_density"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Acetabulum","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetabulum"},{"name":"Pathologic fracture","weight":0.0775456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathologic_fracture"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.0549849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Brittleness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"}]}
