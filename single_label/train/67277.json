{"id":67277,"title":"Cumulative delivery rates after ICSI with donor spermatozoa in different age groups.","abstract":"This retrospective cohort study followed a total of 364 women from their first fresh, donor intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle through to up to six ICSI cycles. All patients started their treatment between January 2003 and December 2007. Live delivery after 25 weeks of gestation was the main outcome measure. The overall crude cumulative delivery rate (CDR) after six cycles was 66% while the overall expected CDR was 90%. In women aged 38-39 years, the crude and expected CDR after six cycles were 54% and 82%, respectively. In women aged 30-37 years, the crude and expected CDR after six cycles were 66% and 91%, respectively. In women aged 20-29 years the crude and expected CDR after six cycles were 81% and 93%, respectively. No significant difference was found between the CDR of patients who had a primary ICSI treatment (no previous intrauterine insemination) and patients who had previous intrauterine insemination. This study corroborates the impact of age on ICSI with donor spermatozoa.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631165","annotations":[{"name":"Artificial insemination","weight":0.927138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination"},{"name":"Spermatozoon","weight":0.862176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoon"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.814156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.661611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Cytoplasm","weight":0.518909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection"},{"name":"Insemination","weight":0.278001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insemination"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.126953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"2003","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"364","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/364"},{"name":"2029","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2029"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Clinical endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_endpoint"},{"name":"Measure (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"}]}
