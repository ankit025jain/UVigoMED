{"id":23459,"title":"Mitral leaflet restoration using a billowing leaflet in active infective endocarditis.","abstract":"A key to the success of mitral valve repair in patients with infective endocarditis is the technique used for reconstruction of the missing leaflet. We report the case of a 47-year-old man with active mitral infective endocarditis. After dissection of the infected segments of P3 and the posteromedial commissure, the defect was reconstructed using tissue from a billowing A2 medial and A3 segment. Chordal transfer with an anterior chord was performed to correct the A3 mild prolapse. Follow-up echocardiography showed recovery of mitral valve morphology and function without regurgitation.
