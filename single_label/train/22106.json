{"id":22106,"title":"Successful treatment of a necrotizing fasciitis patient caused by Mucor indicus with amphotericin B and skin grafting.","abstract":"Cutaneous mucormycosis, an uncommon disease caused by Mucorales, predominantly occurs in immunocompromised host. The present case is a primary cutaneous mucormycosis due to Mucor indicus in an immunocompetent individual. It is with the features of necrotizing fasciitis over the right pretibial area. We are presenting this case owing to its rarity and the successful treatment with amphotericin B and skin grafting.
