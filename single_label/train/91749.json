{"id":91749,"title":"Complications after corrective surgery for lateral patellar luxation in dogs: 36 cases (2000-2011).","abstract":"To determine the frequency and severity of complications after corrective surgery in dogs with lateral patellar luxation (LPL) and identify risk factors for reluxation.Retrospective case series.36 client-owned dogs with 47 affected stifle joints.Medical records of dogs that underwent surgical correction of LPL at 1 of 2 veterinary teaching hospitals between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. Data analyzed included signalment, grade of luxation, orthopedic comorbidities, surgical procedures performed, frequency and type of complications, and whether a second surgery was performed.A total of 36 dogs with 47 affected stifle joints met the inclusion criteria. Complications were recorded for 24 of 47 (51.1%) stifle joints; there were major complications for 18 of 47 (38.3%) stifle joints. All complications were confirmed through examination by a veterinarian. The most frequent complication was reluxation, which was detected in 10 of 47 (21.3%) stifle joints. Dogs that underwent bilateral surgical repair during a single anesthetic episode had odds of reluxation that were 12.5 times the odds of reluxation for dogs that underwent unilateral surgical repair.Complication rate after corrective surgery for LPL was high, with reluxation being the most common complication in this population of dogs. Performing staged bilateral surgeries may decrease the risk of reluxation.","date":"2014-01-31","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24479459","annotations":[{"name":"Orthopedic surgery","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery"},{"name":"Veterinarian","weight":0.72699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.671361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.608223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Anesthetic","weight":0.54804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.530912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Luxating patella","weight":0.38724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxating_patella"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.219465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.146844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.125424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Patella","weight":0.0199414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Bilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism"},{"name":"Episode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episode"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Stifle joint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stifle_joint"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Dog type","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_type"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
