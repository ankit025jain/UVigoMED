{"id":90259,"title":"Laboratory evaluation of Drawtex Hydroconductive dressing with LevaFiber technology.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess absorption, sequestration and retention of microorganisms by Drawtex Hydroconductive dressing with LevaFiberTM technology.The absorption over time and the ability to sequester and retain bacteria were assessed in the laboratory using an in vitro model where known amounts of fluid and microorganisms were allowed to absorb and sequester over a 24 hour period. The reduction in numbers of microorganisms following sequestration was determined using standard plate counting methods. Retention of the organisms was visualised by scanning electron microscopy.Drawtex was shown to absorb eight times its own weight in fluid over time and it showed a 90% reduction in bacterial numbers over a 24 hour period in sequestration experiments. Direct observation by scanning electron microscopy demonstrated bacterial retention in the dressing fibres.Drawtex is a recent addition to the formulary for absorbent dressings available in the UK. It demonstrates excellent absorption properties, while maintaining integrity. In addition, it sequesters and retains microorganisms, which will help with removal of exudate and bioburden from the wound bed to help facilitate wound healing.This study was funded by an educational grant from Martindale Pharma, UK. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare with regard to the manuscript or its content.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633057","annotations":[{"name":"Scanning electron microscope","weight":0.905122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Electron","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron"},{"name":"Organism","weight":0.750361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.735261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.71151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.672903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.670478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.560101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","weight":0.445899,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.438413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.309074,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.159066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.138717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Sorption","weight":0.121581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorption"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Exudate","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudate"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Scientific modelling","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling"},{"name":"Carbon sequestration","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Integrity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity"},{"name":"Counting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Grant (money)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_(money)"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Manuscript","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"},{"name":"Conflict of interest","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest"}]}
