{"id":90075,"title":"[Renovation stem revision femoral head arthroplasty for unstable intertrochanteric fracture in the elderly].","abstract":"To observe clinical efficacy of renovation stem revision femoral head arthroplasty for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fracture in the elderly.Totally 32 elderly patients with unstable intertrochanteric fracture were treated with renovation stem revision femoral head arthroplasty from September 2007 to January 2011. There were 11 males and 21 females with an average age of 83.8 (ranged, 80 to 98) years old,the time from injury to hospital ranged from 4 h to 14 days. According to Evans-Jensen classification, 6 cases were type II a, 20 cases were type II b, and 6 cases were type III. Postoperative mortality, complication rates and Harris hip function score were compared and analyzed to evaluate curative effect.All patients were followed up and no dislocation occurred. Six patients were died during 15 months and 4.5 years; 24 cases recoved to independent wakling at 6 months after operation, and 8 cases walked with stick and walker. The average Harris hip joint function score were (91.56 +/- 2.96), 28 cases got excellent results and 4 cases good. Nine cases occurred complications and healed after treatment.Renovation stem revision femoral head arthroplasty is a active and reliable method in treating unstable intertrochanteric fracture in the elderly.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654512","annotations":[{"name":"Injury","weight":0.727042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.669175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.574758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.547415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.545714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.530164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.523998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.45968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.459539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.328706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.320456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.240041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Femur head","weight":0.0393397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur_head"},{"name":"Hip joint","weight":0.0335145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_joint"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Renovation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renovation"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Batting average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Walker (mobility)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_(mobility)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
