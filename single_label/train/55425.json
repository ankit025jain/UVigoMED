{"id":55425,"title":"Central retinal vein occlusion in a pediatric patient with SLE and antiphospholipid antibodies without anti-cardiolipin or anti-?2 glycoprotein I antibodies.","abstract":"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is characterized by venous and/or arterial thrombosis, and is found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Its diagnosis requires the presence of both clinical and laboratory findings, such as positive anti-cardiolipin and anti-?2 glycoprotein I antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. However, cardiolipin is a minor component of the vascular endothelial cells in human, and phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are major components.A 15-year-old female suddenly developed massive left intraretinal hemorrhaging due to central retinal vein occlusion. She also had a butterfly rash, and her laboratory findings revealed positive serum anti-nuclear antibodies and decreased serum complement. During this episode, she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. Although she was negative for serum anti-cardiolipin IgG and anti-?2 glycoprotein I antibodies as well as lupus anticoagulant, her serum anti-phosphatidylcholine, anti-phosphatidylethanolamine, anti-phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine IgG antibodies levels were increased.Pediatric cases of central retinal vein occlusion are rare. Even in patients without anti-cardiolipin or anti-?2 glycoprotein I antibodies and lupus anticoagulant, there is the potential for the development of antiphospholipid antibody-related thrombosis.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885875","annotations":[{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Lupus anticoagulant","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_anticoagulant"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Phosphatidylserine","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylserine"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.835844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.807364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.778312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.756617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Lupus erythematosus","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.736088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","weight":0.630984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_syndrome"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.597475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.584953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.467703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.395494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Anti-nuclear antibody","weight":0.373382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_antibody"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.325046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.230524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cardiolipin","weight":0.205556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiolipin"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Phosphatidylethanolamine","weight":0.0539337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylethanolamine"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0471077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Phosphatidylcholine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylcholine"},{"name":"Retinal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
