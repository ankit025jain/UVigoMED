{"id":50716,"title":"Increased incorporation of antiplasmin into the fibrin network in patients with type 1 diabetes.","abstract":"Diabetes is associated with various vascular complications and is suggested to induce a prothrombotic state. In the current study, we characterized antiplasmin incorporation into fibrin in relation to other fibrinolytic compounds in patients with type 1 diabetes.A total of 236 patients with type 1 diabetes and 78 control subjects were investigated. The incorporation of antiplasmin into the fibrin network and the plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) activity, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity, tPA/PAI-1 complex, plasmin-antiplasmin complex, antiplasmin, factor XIII, and d-dimer were measured. In addition, we used global assays to study fibrinolysis.The incorporation of antiplasmin into the fibrin network was significantly higher in patients with type 1 diabetes than in control subjects without diabetes (1.65 ± 0.25 vs. 1.35 ± 0.18 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.0001). The patients also had lower PAI-1 activity (2.19 units/mL [interquartile range 0.96-5.42] vs. 4.25 units/mL [1.95-9.0]; P = 0.0012) and antiplasmin level in plasma (78.5 ± 13.3 vs. 83.2 ± 15.4 mg/L; P < 0.05), resulting in a higher fibrinolytic capacity (shorter clot lysis time; P = 0.0090). We did not find any important sex differences regarding fibrinolysis in the patients or in the control subjects.Patients with type 1 diabetes incorporate more antiplasmin into the fibrin network than control subjects without diabetes do and have a reduced PAI-1 activity and a shorter clot lysis time. These results suggest that patients with type 1 diabetes produce a fibrin clot that is more resistant to fibrinolysis, which, however, may be counteracted by an increased fibrinolytic potential in plasma.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760258","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Fibrinolysis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinolysis"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.849915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1","weight":0.816951,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator_inhibitor-1"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Lysis","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Factor XIII","weight":0.748023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_XIII"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.737607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.688329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.59774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.59143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Alpha 2-antiplasmin","weight":0.399151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_2-antiplasmin"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator","weight":0.199842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"965","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/965"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Sexual dimorphism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"}]}
