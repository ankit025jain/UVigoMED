{"id":28007,"title":"Not-so-clean fun: a profile of bath salt users among a college sample in the United States.","abstract":"This research examines the characteristics of users of synthetic stimulants marketed as \"bath salts.\" Synthetic stimulants such as MDPV (3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone), Mephedrone (4-Methylmethcathinone), and Methylone (3,4-Methylenedioxymethcathinone) are often contained in products sold at convenience stores and over the Internet in the United States. Despite the recent legal action banning these types of synthetic stimulants, little is known about the characteristics of the users of these substances. This research provides a profile of bath salt users in the United States among an emerging adult population. A self-report survey instrument was administered to 2,349 students at a large university in the southeastern United States. Respondents indicated whether they had used synthetic stimulants and reported demographic characteristics. Results indicated that users of bath salts were more likely to be male, Hispanic or Native American, student athletes, employed, identify as a members of the LGBT community, and users of other substances.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052791","annotations":[{"name":"LGBT","weight":0.660937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.532936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"College","weight":0.523122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.499663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.439644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"Law","weight":0.431648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Salt","weight":0.358825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt"},{"name":"University","weight":0.302103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.171124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.167939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.146925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Southeastern United States","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"},{"name":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","weight":0.103071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Convenience store","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store"},{"name":"Demography","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography"},{"name":"Sportsperson","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson"},{"name":"Gay community","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_community"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Stimulant","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Bathing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing"},{"name":"Salt (chemistry)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"}]}
