{"id":38863,"title":"Short mandible - a possible risk factor for cleft palate with/without a cleft lip.","abstract":"To estimate the influence of a short mandible on the risk of developing a cleft palate with/without a cleft lip (CP).The retrospective sample consisted of 115 2-month-old Danish infants with CP, and 70 control infants with unilateral incomplete cleft lip (UICL).Cephalometric X-rays were obtained. Mandibular length (Lm ) was measured and corrected for body length (Lb ) to remove influence of varying body length in the sample. Logistic regression was applied to the corrected mandibular length (Lmc ) to calculate the risk of having a cleft palate.The mean mandibular length in the group with CP was about 4 mm shorter than in the control group. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated to be 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.48-0.68), implying that an individual's risk of cleft palate with/without a cleft lip increases about 50% per mm decrease in mandibular length.A special facial type including a short mandible is a possible risk factor for cleft palate, and it was found that the risk of cleft palate increases 58% per mm decreases in mandibular length.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397533","annotations":[{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.930781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.3662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Cleft lip and palate","weight":0.297222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_palate"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.296462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.240727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.223677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Denmark","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"},{"name":"Mandible","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.029087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Palate","weight":0.0188318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Interval (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Lip","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip"},{"name":"Maltese lira","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_lira"},{"name":"Cephalometry","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometry"},{"name":"Pound (mass)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)"},{"name":"Logistic function","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
