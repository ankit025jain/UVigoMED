{"id":51588,"title":"Cardiovascular actions of GLP-1 and incretin-based pharmacotherapy.","abstract":"Incretin-based therapy became recently available as antihyperglycemic treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Incretin therapy comprises glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4-I): these classes of drugs not only have the ability to reduce blood glucose, but also can exert several cardioprotective effects. They have been shown to positively influence some risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), to improve endothelial function, and to directly affect cardiac function. For these reasons incretins are considered not only antidiabetic drugs, but also cardiovascular effective. The first clinical trials aimed to demonstrate the safety of DPP4 inhibitors have been recently published: their clinical significance will be discussed in light of the prior experimental findings.
