{"id":69531,"title":"[Experimental validation of the use of ND:YAG-interstitial laser coagulation of the kidney].","abstract":"Interstitial laser coagulation (ILC) is one of the effective methods of minimally invasive destruction of small renal tumors. For the safe use of ILC in clinical practice, it is necessary to select the optimal mode of action of laser radiation on the tissue of target organ and techniques for the procedure. The effects of ILC on kidney tissue in 6 rabbits weighing less than 3 kg and 5 mongrel dogs weighing up to 20 kg were investigated in vivo. The impact of ILC was made intraoperatively. Organ retrieval in experimental animals for the macro- and microscopic examination was performed immediately after the impact of ILC and at various times thereafter during the month in rabbits and 35 days in dogs. Morphological study in different periods after exposure allowed to establish phasing and volumes of changes in the tissues of the kidney, confirming the safety and efficacy of ND:YAG laser irradiation on kidney tissues. The results indicate the possibility of effective application of ILC of kidney tissues for destruction of small size tumors, without impairment of functions of the organ.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437246","annotations":[{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Coagulation","weight":0.765245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.708697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.49927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Rabbit","weight":0.495686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.44764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.330911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.295809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.287322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Microscopic scale","weight":0.231231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopic_scale"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.230524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Kidney cancer","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_cancer"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.079334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Yttrium aluminium garnet","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium_aluminium_garnet"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Information retrieval","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"},{"name":"North Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota"},{"name":"Phase (waves)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)"},{"name":"Action film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film"},{"name":"Effective results in number theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_results_in_number_theory"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Safety (American and Canadian football position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Macroscopic scale","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_scale"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
