{"id":29156,"title":"Finasteride associated melasma in a Caucasian male.","abstract":"Melasma is an acquired hypermelanosis that typically affects sun-exposed areas on the face and presents as symmetric brownish macules and patches. It is most commonly reported in women and thought to be related to the effects of estrogen and progesterone on melanocytes. Since the advent of finasteride 1mg daily tablets for the treatment of androgenic alopecia, we have noticed an increase in the number of men presenting with melasma. Here we present one of those cases. We hypothesize this could be related to the effects of finasteride on estrogen and progesterone concentrations in the skin.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719069","annotations":[{"name":"Androgenic alopecia","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_alopecia"},{"name":"Progesterone","weight":0.853728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone"},{"name":"Estrogen","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.705464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Finasteride","weight":0.636012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finasteride"},{"name":"Melasma","weight":0.632117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melasma"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Alopecia","weight":0.612412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.567686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Melanocyte","weight":0.515767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.259539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Tablet","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Melanosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanosis"},{"name":"Caucasian race","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race"}]}
