{"id":82580,"title":"Alpha 2 integrin gene (ITGA2) polymorphism in renal transplant recipients with and without drug induced gingival overgrowth.","abstract":"Variances in fibroblasts' ?2?1 integrin intensity may lead to altered adhesion to type I collagen and consequently to suppression of phagocytosis which may be one of the mechanisms for drug induced gingival overgrowth. The present study aimed to evaluate the genotype and allele frequencies of ?2 integrin +807 gene in renal transplant patients with and without gingival overgrowth.Seventy renal transplant patients with cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth (CsA GO+) were enrolled. Renal transplant patients without GO medicated with CsA (CsA GO-; n=79) and tacrolimus (Tac; n=52) served as controls. DNA was obtained from peripheral blood and ITGA2 +807C/T polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Clinical parameters including probing depth and plaque, papilla bleeding and hyperplasia indexes were recorded. Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used in statistical analysis.Clinical parameters of CsA GO+ group were significantly higher than those of the CsA GO- and Tac groups (p<0.05). ITGA2 807C/T genotype and allele frequencies of study groups were similar (p>0.05).Within the limits of the present study it can be concluded that ITGA2 +807 gene polymorphism is not associated with susceptibility to CsA-induced GO.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Stomatognathic
