{"id":82760,"title":"Jaw deviation and ankylosis caused by condylar osteochondroma: long-term treatment outcome.","abstract":"To evaluate outcomes of total subcondylar excision of mandibular condylar osteochondroma.Two adult patients presented with progressive facial asymmetry, jaw deviation, and limited mouth opening. Computed tomogram (CT) showed a large osseous tumor arising from the right condyle occupying the subtemporal space in these patients. Complete surgical excision was performed without condyle reconstruction. The pathology report indicated osteochondroma. Patients were followed for an average of 5 years.Long-term evaluation showed restoration of dento-occlusal function and facial appearance. Follow-up CT showed a partly regenerated and remodeled condyle. Patients' chewing function was acceptable, but predominantly on the lesion side.Condylar osteochondroma caused jaw deviation and joint dysfunction. Complete surgical excision achieved an adequate long-term outcome, but condylar reconstruction is advisable.","date":"2014-02-17","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528566","annotations":[{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Ankylosis","weight":0.822098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.814433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.799994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Jaw","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.751564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.645049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Mastication","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastication"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.618007,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.447438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.371507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.344165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Osteochondroma","weight":0.111412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteochondroma"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Human physical appearance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_physical_appearance"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Facial symmetry","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_symmetry"},{"name":"Condyloid process","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyloid_process"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"}]}
