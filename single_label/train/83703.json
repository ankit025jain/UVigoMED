{"id":83703,"title":"[Effect of Gansui Banxia Tang plus-minus Gansui and Gancao anti-drug combination that preferred dose close to clinical application on diuretic effect in malignant ascites rats].","abstract":"To observe the effect of Gansui Banxia Tang plus-minus Gansui and Gancao anti-drug combination on hepatic and renal functions in malignant ascites rats to explore whether the efficacy or toxicity associated with the anti-drug combination.The male wistar rats were randomly divided into a blank group, model group, furosemide group, Gansui Banxia Tang group, Gansui Banxia Tang removed Zhigancao group, Gansui Banxia Tang removed Cugansui group, Gansui Banxia Tang removed Zhigancao and Cugansui group. In addition to normal feeding, every morning except for the blank group and model group, the rest of the group was given drugs, the control group and the model group was given distilled water, the volume is 10 mL x kg(-1). Administered five days, all rats were fasted but except water for 24 hours to collect urine. Administered nine days all rats were fasted but except water for 12 hours, we need to weigh weight of rats. When we remove the ascites, we also need to weigh weight of rats. We use the weight before removing ascites minus weight after removing ascites to indirectly measure the amount of ascites. When we remove the ascites, we need to abdominal aortic blood, centrifuge testing renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone and other indicators.The effect of Gansui Banixa Tang on increasing the net weight, lowering abdominal circumference and body weight ratio, lowering renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone is better than the other treatment group.In diuresis party, the group of Gansui Banxia Tang is better than the group of Gansui Banxia Tang remove Zhigancao or Cugansui or Zhigancao and Cugansui, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may play a diuretic effect of its one way.","date":"2014-09-29","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272504","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Diuretic","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic"},{"name":"Aldosterone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone"},{"name":"Furosemide","weight":0.88075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furosemide"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Vasopressin","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin"},{"name":"Renin","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.796625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Angiotensin II","weight":0.779457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II"},{"name":"Urine","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.575092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.476722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.443289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.438199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.435138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.433764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.328393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.318004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.227775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Antidiuretic","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidiuretic"},{"name":"Distilled water","weight":0.120071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_water"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.105637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Distillation","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"},{"name":"Centrifuge","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifuge"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Internet","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Tang Dynasty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Dynasty"}]}
