{"id":46923,"title":"Prevalence and factors associated with liver steatosis as measured by transient elastography with controlled attenuation parameter in HIV-infected patients.","abstract":"To assess the prevalence and factors associated with significant hepatic steatosis (SHS, steatosis involving ?10% hepatocytes) in HIV-infected patients.A prospective, cross-sectional study.Five hundred and five HIV-infected patients were included in this study. All patients underwent a transient elastography examination with the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). SHS was defined using the previously identified CAP cut-off of 238 dB/m. We analysed the associations between SHS and demographics, metabolic data, coinfections and drug therapy.SHS was detected in 201 (40%) patients. Individuals with and without plasma HIV RNA of 50 copies/ml or less presented SHS in 168 (42%) and 33 (31%) cases, respectively (P = 0.030). Patients with SHS compared with those without SHS presented higher median (IQR) BMI [BMI, 25.6 (22.5-28) vs. 22.3 (20.3-24.2) kg/m; P < 10], DBP [79 (72-85) vs. 74 (68-81) mmHg; P = 0.0001], fasting plasma glucose [95 (87-106) vs. 91 (84-97) mg/dl; P = 0.002] and triglycerides [128 (92-189) vs. 109 (80-167) mg/dl; P = 0.002], and lower HDL cholesterol [44 (37-54) vs. 48 (40-59), mg/dl; P = 0.004]. In multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with SHS was BMI [per unit increase, adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.34 (1.22-1-47); P < 10].SHS measured by CAP is highly prevalent among HIV-infected patients. High BMI is the main predictor of SHS in this setting.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614088","annotations":[{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.864015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Fatty liver","weight":0.846198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver"},{"name":"Cholesterol","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.804534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"High-density lipoprotein","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.737751,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Triglyceride","weight":0.72699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Steatosis","weight":0.546141,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.491167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.458146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Pharmacology","weight":0.445984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.299804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.291457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.18939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"DBm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBm"},{"name":"Elastography","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastography"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Interquartile range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"324","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/324"},{"name":"238","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/238"},{"name":"ADO Den Haag","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO_Den_Haag"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Attenuation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Units of measurement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement"}]}
