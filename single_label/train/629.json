{"id":629,"title":"Alert microorganisms isolated from patients hospitalized in Ma?opolskie province in 2010-2012.","abstract":"Healthcare centers undertake supervisory activities to control health care-associated infections (HCAIs) by elaborating procedures, identifying alert microorganisms and analyzing data collected. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of alert microorganisms in hospital wards in 2010-2012.Legislation which is in force since several years introduced the principles of health care-associated infections control and reporting system. Analysis was based on annual reports on alert microorganisms provided by 19 District Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations from Ma?opolskie province. The data discuss positive tests results for alert microorganisms in patients who stayed in hospitals supervised by the Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations.Compared to 2010-2011, the number of tests per hospital bed in 2012 was lower, amounting to 24 (2010 - 44, 2011 - 34). Of these tests, the majority was performed in the following wards: transplantology (2010 - 339, 2011 - 354, 2012 - 330), burn care (2010 - 354, 2011 - 148, 2012 - 113) and ICUs for adults (2010 - 155, 2011 - 157, 2012 - 140). In 2010-2012, an increase in the number of positive test results for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL+) and Clostridium difficile as well as slight decrease in the number of positive test results for other alert microorganisms were noted. The highest number of microorganisms was identified in neonatal and neonatal pathology (Enterobacteriaceae ESBL+); pediatric and infectious diseases (Rotavirus); infectious diseases (Rotavirus, C.difficile); burn care (Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas sp.) and ophthalmic and hemodialysis wards (MRSA).Irrespective of a decrease in the number of tests per hospital bed in 2012, a high number of positive test results for alert microorganisms was observed. It suggests the necessity for wider application of collected data as to improve monitoring of infections and reduce resulting threats.","date":"2014-11-13","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25391008","annotations":[{"name":"Clostridium difficile","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_difficile"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Rotavirus","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.750663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.711976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Sanitation","weight":0.567703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation"},{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.211645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Clostridium","weight":0.176993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium"},{"name":"Beta-lactamase","weight":0.119542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase"},{"name":"Pseudomonas","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"},{"name":"Legislation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation"},{"name":"Acinetobacter","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acinetobacter"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Hospital bed","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_bed"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"}]}
