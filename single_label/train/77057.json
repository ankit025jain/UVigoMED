{"id":77057,"title":"Prevalence and factors associated with metabolic syndrome among a group of Thai working population: a cross sectional study.","abstract":"To determine prevalence and factors associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) among employees of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand based in Bangkok.The present study was conducted among 2,544 participants (1,875 men, 669 women) enrolled in the cohort study of Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital. Baseline cross sectional data in 2009 was analyzed. The MetS was defined using NCEP ATP III criteria. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) stratified by gender were computed.Overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 16.6%, 18.2% in males and 10.3% in females. More than half of the participants had a low intensity of physical activity. Significant non-modified factors associated with MetS among males were increased age (OR = 1.02; borderline 95% CI 1.00-1.04), levels of education were bachelor degree and lower compared with higher than bachelor degree (OR = 1.87; 95% CI 1.20-2.91 and OR = 2.28; 95% CI 1.32-3.93), working in a middle and lower type of job (OR = 1.44; 95% CI 1.01-2.05, OR = 2.08; 95% CI 0.98-4.40) compared with a high-end type of job. For females, significant factors associated with MetS were increased age (OR = 1.08; 95%CI 1.02-1.15), having middle income compared with high income (OR = 3.01; 95% CI 1.28-7.06).Modified risk factor in low physical activity should be managed by increased intensity of physical activity among participants in a low and middle type of job and income to reduce cardiovascular risk.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic
