{"id":30894,"title":"A multicenter phase II study of sorafenib monotherapy in clinically selected patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma after failure of EGFR-TKI therapy (Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group, CTONG 0805).","abstract":"Aim of the study was to investigate efficacy and safety of sorafenib in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma after failure of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) therapy.Patients who were diagnosed with stage IIIB or stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, and benefited from one prior EGFR-TKI therapy and then failed, were eligible. No more than one previous chemotherapy regimen was permitted. Patients received oral sorafenib 400mg twice daily continuously until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR). Secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). For patients who agreed to provide peripheral blood or tumor tissue, we analyzed the genotype of Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) deletion polymorphism and EGFR mutation status.Of 65 enrolled patients, 64 were evaluable. The DCR was 32.8%, which did not meet the predefined statistical hypothesis of 38.4%. The median PFS and OS were 3.7 months [95% (confidence interval), 3.5-3.9 months] and 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.7-9.2 months), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed no correlation between DCR and age, gender, smoking status and performance status. Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) was the predominant toxicity occurring in 71.9% of patients. Fourteen patients (21.9%) had ? grade 2 dermatologic reactions that resulted sorafenib dose reduction in three patients (4.7%). Of 36 patients, the BIM deletion polymorphism was found in 3, and no response to sorafenib was observed. In 30 tumor tissues, 22 EGFR active mutations were found. The DCR had no significant difference between mutation-positive and wild-type patients (31.8% vs. 42.9%, respectively; HR, 0.622; p=0.665).","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Chemically-Induced
