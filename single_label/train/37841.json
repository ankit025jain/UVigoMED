{"id":37841,"title":"Rapidly fatal \"congenital lung dysplasia\": a case report and review of the literature.","abstract":"Acinar dysplasia congenital alveolar dysplasia and alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins belong to the diffuse developmental disorders (congenital lung dysplasia), very rare fatal disorders of infancy that occur early in lung development. A case of quickly fatal congenital lung dysplasia in a full-term infant is presented and underlines the necessity to suspect this disease in a newborn suffering from severe and refractory respiratory distress.
