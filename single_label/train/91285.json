{"id":91285,"title":"Atypical stress-avulsion fracture of the Lisfranc joint complex.","abstract":"Antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic erythematosus have been associated with metatarsal stress fractures. Stress fractures of the Lisfranc joint complex are uncommon injuries but have been reported to occur most frequently in ballet dancers. We present a case of an avulsion fracture of the Lisfranc joint complex that occurred spontaneously. We have reviewed the association between systemic conditions and metatarsal fractures and proposed a series of hypothetical pathological events that may have contributed to this unusual injury.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521754","annotations":[{"name":"Metatarsus","weight":0.878651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsus"},{"name":"Avulsion fracture","weight":0.786823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avulsion_fracture"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.637329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.399356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.13807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Stress fracture","weight":0.128596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_fracture"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Dance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance"},{"name":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_syndrome"},{"name":"Tarsometatarsal articulations","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsometatarsal_articulations"},{"name":"Complex number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"},{"name":"Association football","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"},{"name":"Lisfranc fracture","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisfranc_fracture"},{"name":"Ballet","weight":0.0150458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
