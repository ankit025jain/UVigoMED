{"id":72514,"title":"Trends in use of and attitudes held towards alternative and complementary medicine among patients treated in a Department of Medical Oncology in Serbia. A several-years-apart time survey study.","abstract":"To determine the prevalence of concurrent use and attitude towards complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by patients undergoing conventional therapy with anticancer agents at the National Cancer Center of Serbia (IORS).The study sample comprised 300 subjects undergoing chemotherapy at the Medical Oncology Department of IORS. For the purposes of this research we constructed a special questionnaire with clearly defined questions. The research was carried out in 1993, in 2000 and in 2008.The percentage of patients who used CAM was over 50% in all 3 time periods. In 1993 and in 2000, 10% of the patients stated that their treating physicians were the ones who suggested using CAM, whereas this percentage rose to 30% in the 2008 survey (p<0.001). Most of the patients used CAM after recommendation by their family members or close friends. Patients believed that CAM would strengthen their immunity (this finding remained almost the same in all time periods, i.e. approximately 65%). Up to one third of CAM users believed that CAM will cure their malignant disease, whereas most of the patients expected better effects of the standard treatment if aided by CAM (p=0.012). The monthly expenditure for CAM was approximately â‚¬100.The results of this study may help oncologists to recognize features of CAM methods and understand why patients use them. Timely patient information about the disease and the treatment options will increase confidence in conventional therapies.","date":"2014-06-26","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965418","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.810247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.743735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.68562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.676072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.584039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Serbia","weight":0.305063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.275564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.201356,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Anticarcinogen","weight":0.051875,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticarcinogen"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Rose","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Convention (norm)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)"},{"name":"Marvel Comics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1993","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Alternative rock","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Fad","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Up (2009 film)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Law of agency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency"},{"name":"Survey research","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_research"},{"name":"Concurrency (road)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(road)"},{"name":"300 (film)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)"},{"name":"Corruption Perceptions Index","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index"}]}
