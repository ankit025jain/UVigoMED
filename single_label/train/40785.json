{"id":40785,"title":"The IBD drug pipeline-ready to deliver?","abstract":"The study of modified-release phosphatidylcholine in this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology by Karner et al. is a substantial step forward for a mucosal barrier agent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is the first agent in a novel class to demonstrate clinical efficacy in a phase 2 study. There are a number of new agents with new mechanisms of action that are rapidly advancing through the IBD drug development pipeline. This article reviews the promising candidates and mechanisms of action in late-phase trials in IBD.
