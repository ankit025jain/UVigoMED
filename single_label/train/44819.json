{"id":44819,"title":"Protein-protein interaction network analyses for elucidating the roles of LOXL2-delta72 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","abstract":"Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), a member of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family, is a copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes oxidative deamination of lysine residues on protein substrates. LOXL2 was found to be overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in our previous research. We later identified a LOXL2 splicing variant LOXL2-delta72 and we overexpressed LOXL2-delta72 and its wild type counterpart in ESCC cells following microarray analyses. First, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of LOXL2 and LOXL2-delta72 compared to empty plasmid were applied to generate protein-protein interaction (PPI) sub-networks. Comparison of these two sub-networks showed hundreds of different proteins. To reveal the potential specific roles of LOXL2- delta72 compared to its wild type, the DEGs of LOXL2-delta72 vs LOXL2 were also applied to construct a PPI sub-network which was annotated by Gene Ontology. The functional annotation map indicated the third PPI sub-network involved hundreds of GO terms, such as \"cell cycle arrest\", \"G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle\", \"interphase\", \"cell-matrix adhesion\" and \"cell-substrate adhesion\", as well as significant \"immunity\" related terms, such as \"innate immune response\", \"regulation of defense response\" and \"Toll signaling pathway\". These results provide important clues for experimental identification of the specific biological roles and molecular mechanisms of LOXL2-delta72. This study also provided a work flow to test the different roles of a splicing variant with high-throughput data.","date":"2014-04-10","categories":"Digestive System
