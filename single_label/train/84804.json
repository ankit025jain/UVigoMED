{"id":84804,"title":"The effect of oleanolic and ursolic acids on the hemolytic properties and biofilm formation of Listeria monocytogenes.","abstract":"Oleanolic acid and ursolic acid are pentacyclic triterpenoids isolated from a variety of medicinal plants, which have antibacterial activity. Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive facultative pathogen, being the causative agent of listeriosis. The present study was carried out to evaluate the in vitro effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations of both triterpene acids on the pathogenicity determinants of L. monocytogenes: their hemolytic activity and biofilm forming ability. Oleanolic and ursolic acids inhibited listeriolysin O activity without influencing toxin secretion. Biofilm formation, and the viability of L. monocytogenes cells in biofilms was diminished by both compounds. Thus, both acids affected L. monocytogenes virulence. It was also demonstrated that oleanolic acid bound to the peptidoglycan of L. monocytogenes and this interaction was influenced by teichoic acids.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25033658","annotations":[{"name":"Listeria monocytogenes","weight":0.913612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria_monocytogenes"},{"name":"Peptidoglycan","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptidoglycan"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.878472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Terpenoid","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpenoid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Terpene","weight":0.794441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terpene"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Teichoic acid","weight":0.731783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teichoic_acid"},{"name":"Listeria","weight":0.728698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeria"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.665421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.628487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Listeriosis","weight":0.498943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeriosis"},{"name":"Hemolysis","weight":0.453116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"},{"name":"Pathogenicity","weight":0.379552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenicity"},{"name":"Facultative anaerobic organism","weight":0.208726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultative_anaerobic_organism"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.12596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Triterpene","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triterpene"},{"name":"Listeriolysin O","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listeriolysin_O"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Interaction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction"}]}
