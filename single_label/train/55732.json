{"id":55732,"title":"Selective laser trabeculoplasty for glaucoma secondary to emulsified silicone oil after pars plana vitrectomy: a pilot study.","abstract":"To investigate the efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) secondary to emulsified silicone oil (SO).Prospective, interventional, consecutive case series of 11 eyes with sustained elevation of IOP after SO removal. The mean IOP at baseline, week 1, month 1, month 3, and month 6 was evaluated. The mean baseline IOP was significantly decreased from 25 ± 2.7 mmHg to 18.4 ± 5.5 mmHg at week 1 (P = 0.01), 17.9 ± 3.1 mmHg at month 1 (P = 0.008), 15.8 ± 3.9 mmHg at month 3 (P = 0.003), and 16.2 ± 4.7 mmHg at month 6 (P = 0.004). IOP < 21 mmHg was achieved in 91% of the eyes without a significant complication at month 6.SLT may be successful for lowering IOP in patients with OAG secondary to emulsified SO which was not controlled with maximum antiglaucomatous medical treatment.","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24822212","annotations":[{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.806677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Emulsion","weight":0.587366,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.580203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.405052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.352127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.295715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.275698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"MmHg","weight":0.259352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MmHg"},{"name":"Silicone oil","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone_oil"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Pars plana","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pars_plana"},{"name":"Vitrectomy","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Plana","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plana"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Binding selectivity","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_selectivity"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"OAG (band)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAG_(band)"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Secondary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school"},{"name":"IBM Solid Logic Technology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Solid_Logic_Technology"},{"name":"2011 Six Nations Championship","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Six_Nations_Championship"}]}
