{"id":13097,"title":"The role of EVI1 in myeloid malignancies.","abstract":"The EVI1 oncogene at human chr 3q26 is rearranged and/or overexpressed in a subset of acute myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasias. The EVI1 protein is a 135 kDa transcriptional regulator with DNA-binding zinc finger domains. Here we provide a critical review of the current state of research into the molecular mechanisms by which this gene plays a role in myeloid malignancies. The major pertinent cellular effects are blocking myeloid differentiation and preventing cellular apoptosis, and several potential mechanisms for these phenomena have been identified. Evidence supports a role for EVI1 in inducing cellular quiescence, and this may contribute to the resistance to chemotherapy seen in patients with neoplasms that overexpress EVI1. Another isoform, MDS1-EVI1 (or PRDM3), encoded by the same locus as EVI1, harbors an N-terminal histone methyltransferase(HMT) domain; experimental findings indicate that this protein and its HMT activity are critical for the progression of a subset of AMLs, and this provides a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24495476","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.836829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.827774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"Zinc finger","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_finger"},{"name":"Protein isoform","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_isoform"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.812569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Locus (genetics)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.717764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.608469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.591156,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.573515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.467894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Receptor antagonist","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Phenomenon","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon"},{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"G0 phase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0_phase"},{"name":"Overexpress","weight":0.0152905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overexpress"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"}]}
