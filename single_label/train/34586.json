{"id":34586,"title":"Abnormalities of myocardial perfusion and glucose metabolism in patients with isolated left ventricular non-compaction.","abstract":"The prevalence of myocardial perfusion and glucose metabolic abnormalities and their significance in patients with isolated left ventricular non-compaction (ILVNC) have not been well investigated.Seventeen ILVNC patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/fluorine-18 deoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET imaging were included. Left ventricular non-compaction, regional wall motion abnormalities, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and delayed enhancement (DE) were estimated using CMR. Myocardial perfusion and metabolism were evaluated with SPECT/PET.Ninety-five (32.9%) segments were considered non-compacted. DE was present in 52 (18.0%) segments and 10 (58.8%) patients. The rate of occurrence of DE was significantly higher in compacted segments than in non-compacted segments (22.7% vs 8.4%, P = .003). Myocardial perfusion abnormalities were present in 92 (31.8%) segments, of which 66 were perfusion/metabolism match and 26 were perfusion/metabolism mismatch. The rate of occurrence of perfusion abnormality was similar between compacted and non-compacted segments (32.0% vs 31.6%, P = .948), but it was significantly higher in segments with DE than in those without DE (51.9% vs 27.4%, P = .001). None of the imaging features alone (non-compaction, DE, perfusion abnormalities, match or mismatch) showed significant correlations with LVEF (all P > .05).In the current study, myocardial perfusion/metabolism mismatch and match were observed in both non-compacted and compacted myocardium in ILVNC patients. Further research is warranted to determine their pathologic and clinical significance.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24723127","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.785044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.760797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.734127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.677915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.621276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Left ventricle","weight":0.596418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_ventricle"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.569465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.461358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.177191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Fraction (mathematics)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Histone","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone"},{"name":"Germany","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"},{"name":"Left-wing politics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"1 decametre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_decametre"},{"name":"948","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/948"},{"name":"Seventeen (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(magazine)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Myocardial perfusion imaging","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_perfusion_imaging"},{"name":"Clinical significance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance"},{"name":"Wall","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall"},{"name":"Abnormalities","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormalities"}]}
