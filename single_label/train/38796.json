{"id":38796,"title":"Surgical pulmonary valve insertion.","abstract":"Pulmonary valve replacement is being performed with increasing frequency in patients with various congenital heart diseases. Chronic pulmonary regurgitation after repair of tetralogy of Fallot is a typical situation that requires pulmonary valve replacement. Chronic pulmonary regurgitation after repair of tetralogy of Fallot can lead to right ventricular dilatation, biventricular dysfunction, heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Although pulmonary valve replacement can lead to improvement in functional class and a substantial decrease or normalisation of right ventricular volumes, the optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement in patients with chronic pulmonary regurgitation is still unknown. There are several options for surgical pulmonary valve replacement. However, no ideal pulmonary valve substitute exists currently and most of the surgically implanted pulmonary valves will eventually require re-replacement. This article will review options and timing of surgical pulmonary valve insertion in patients with chronic pulmonary regurgitation after repair of tetralogy of Fallot.","date":"2014-01-09","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401267","annotations":[{"name":"Pulmonary valve","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_valve"},{"name":"Vasodilation","weight":0.832427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Cardiac dysrhythmia","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_dysrhythmia"},{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.723939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.681913,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Right ventricle","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricle"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.634146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.555419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.470553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.374575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.114428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0397094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Predation","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Valve replacement","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_replacement"}]}
