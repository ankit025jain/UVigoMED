{"id":66829,"title":"[Clinical impact of the intravesical prostatic protrusion: a review by the LUTS committee of the French Urological Association].","abstract":"Intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) is a protrusion of the lateral and/or median prostatic lobes into the bladder lumen. IPP can be estimated by suprapubic ultrasound.A literature search was conducted in Pubmed/MEDLINE database using the following keywords: intravesical prostatic protrusion; benign prostatic enlargement; treatment outcome; ultrasonography.There are 3 grades of IPP: grade 1, 2 and 3 respectively if IPP ? 5mm, if 5-10mm, and if >10mm. IPP was a better prognosis factor than PSA and prostate volume for bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) with a sensibility of 80% and a sensitivity of 68% for grade 3. The progression risk of BOO increased with IPP (grade 1: OR=5.1 [95%CI: 1.6-16.2] and grade ? 2 OR=10.4 [95%CI: 3.3-33.4]). IPP was a predictive marker of failure of trial off catheter in patients with acute urinary retention with a 6 folds higher risk for grades ? 2. IPP was a prognosis factor for tamsulosine efficacy: 78% of patients with grade ? 2 had an improvement >35% of the IPSS-score versus 58% for grade >3 (P<0.01). Patients with grade >3 and a PV< 40cc had a poorer response to tamsulosine. After TURP, IPSS was more improved for grade ? 1 with an OR=3.43 (95%CI: 1.03-11.44, P=0.045).IPP can be a useful marker for the management of LUTS/BPH.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Male
