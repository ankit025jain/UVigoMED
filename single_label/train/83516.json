{"id":83516,"title":"[The construction and application of a novel apparatus for detecting oxygen consumption of mice under normobaric hypoxia].","abstract":"To establish a method for real-time recording the oxygen consumption of mice under normobaric hypoxia.The experimental apparatus was made up of animal container, filling water control system, electronic balance, hose, a computer with weight recording software, etc. The working principle was that the oxygen consumed by animal was replaced by water filling which was controlled by the pneumatic and hydraulic actuator. The water was weighted by an electronic balance and the weight signal was recorded into excel file at the same time. The accuracy and precision of the apparatus were detected by a 10 ml syringe. The oxygen consumption characteristics of 6 acute repetitive hypoxia mice and 6 normal mice were observed.The P value for the paired t test was 1 and the CV value was 4%. The survival time and total oxygen consumption of acute repetitive hypoxia mice were both significantly increased compared to normal mice (P < 0.05), which were (58.8 +/- 6.8) min and (46.0 +/- 8.7) min respectively for the survival time and (85.1 +/- 8.5) ml and (73.6 +/- 5.4) ml respectively for total oxygen consumption.The hypoxia tolerance of the acute repetitive hypoxia mice can significantly improved by taking more oxygen in the animal cabin. The accuracy and precision of the apparatus are high and it can be used for the determination of oxygen consumption in hypoxia research.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330683","annotations":[{"name":"Hydraulics","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics"},{"name":"Computer","weight":0.660642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.572216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Pneumatics","weight":0.554825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.480473,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.471952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Actuator","weight":0.440594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuator"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.429028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.406078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.326731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Control system","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.16105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.145833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Weighing scale","weight":0.119063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.111981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Syringe","weight":0.0775456,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Signal (electronics)","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(electronics)"},{"name":"Containerization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization"},{"name":"Flood control","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_control"},{"name":"Hypoxia (medical)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Angle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle"},{"name":"Horsepower","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Orthogonality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality"},{"name":"Aerobic exercise","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Particle detector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_detector"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Engineering tolerance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance"},{"name":"Hose (tubing)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hose_(tubing)"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"}]}
