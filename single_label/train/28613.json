{"id":28613,"title":"Why psychiatry needs psychedelics and psychedelics need psychiatry.","abstract":"Without researching psychedelic drugs for medical therapy, psychiatry is turning its back on a group of compounds that could have great potential. Without the validation of the medical profession, the psychedelic drugs, and those who take them off-license, remain archaic sentiments of the past, with the users maligned as recreational drug abusers and subject to continued negative opinion. These two disparate groups--psychiatrists and recreational psychedelic drug users--are united by their shared recognition of the healing potential of these compounds. A resolution of this conflict is essential for the future of psychiatric medicine and psychedelic culture alike. Progression will come from professionals working in the field adapting to fit a conservative paradigm. In this way, they can provide the public with important treatments and also raise the profile of expanded consciousness in mainstream society.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24830186","annotations":[{"name":"Hallucinogen","weight":0.825294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.809223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Recreational drug use","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.782496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Psychedelic drug","weight":0.71272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.680329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Consciousness","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"},{"name":"Paradigm","weight":0.646552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.505052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.463777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.458923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Chemical compound","weight":0.336941,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"},{"name":"Society","weight":0.268449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"},{"name":"Mainstream","weight":0.23447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream"},{"name":"Psychedelic","weight":0.113318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic"},{"name":"Recreation","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Profession","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession"},{"name":"War","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War"},{"name":"Archaism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaism"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"}]}
