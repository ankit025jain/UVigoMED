{"id":86406,"title":"Robotic pneumonectomy.","abstract":"Pneumonectomy is indicated for centrally placed tumors when a lung-preserving operation cannot be performed for oncologic reasons. The technique of robotic pneumonectomy is still undergoing development and modification. Several pioneering surgeons have determined it to be feasible but more data are required to determine the benefits and disadvantages of robotic pneumonectomy.
