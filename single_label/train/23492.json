{"id":23492,"title":"Critical role for the AIM2 inflammasome during acute CNS bacterial infection.","abstract":"Interleukin-1? (IL-1?) is essential for eliciting protective immunity during the acute phase of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection in the central nervous system (CNS). We previously demonstrated that microglial IL-1? production in response to live S. aureus is mediated through the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, including the adapter protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-1 recruitment domain), and pro-caspase 1. Here, we utilized NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1/11 knockout (KO) mice to demonstrate the functional significance of inflammasome activity during CNS S. aureus infection. ASC and caspase 1/11 KO animals were exquisitely sensitive, with approximately 50% of mice succumbing to infection within 24 h. Unexpectedly, the survival of NLRP3 KO mice was similar to wild-type animals, suggesting the involvement of an alternative upstream sensor, which was later identified as absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) based on the similar disease patterns between AIM2 and ASC KO mice. Besides IL-1?, other key inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL10, and CCL2 were significantly reduced in the CNS of AIM2 and ASC KO mice, implicating autocrine/paracrine actions of IL-1?, as these mediators do not require inflammasome processing for secretion. These studies demonstrate a novel role for the AIM2 inflammasome as a critical molecular platform for regulating IL-1? release and survival during acute CNS S. aureus infection.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484406","annotations":[{"name":"CCL2","weight":0.907927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCL2"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.833314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Caspase","weight":0.810287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspase"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Melanoma","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.776572,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.772276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.767275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Microglia","weight":0.65549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.627109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Signal transducing adaptor protein","weight":0.531101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transducing_adaptor_protein"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.488665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.384708,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Acute-phase protein","weight":0.38428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute-phase_protein"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.337617,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Gene knockout","weight":0.313135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout"},{"name":"Inflammatory mediators","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_mediators"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"NALP3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NALP3"},{"name":"CXCL10","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL10"},{"name":"CXCL1","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CXCL1"},{"name":"Inflammasome","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammasome"},{"name":"Illinois","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Sensor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor"},{"name":"Post-transcriptional modification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transcriptional_modification"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"}]}
