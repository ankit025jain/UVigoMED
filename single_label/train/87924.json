{"id":87924,"title":"The profile of chest injuries in a southeastern Nigeria teaching hospital, a 10-year experience.","abstract":"Globally, major chest injuries have both high morbidity and mortality. A detailed study of chest injuries in south-eastern Nigeria is here presented.To determine the incidence, the predisposing factors, the pattern of presentation and the outcome of management of chest injuries.This is a retrospective study spanning a period of 10 years (2002-2011). The medical records of all patients with documented chest injuries that presented to our hospital within the period under review, were retrieved and analysed, by simple arithmetic percentages.A total of 402 patients (average of 40/year) with the age ranges in the spectrum of 0-10 and 81-90 years, with a mean of 2.2 were found. Gender-wise, 301 males (74.9%) and 101 females (25.1%) were affected. The aetiological or the predisposing factors were blunt chest injuries (61.2%) and penetrating chest injuries (38.8%). In the pattern of presentation, haemothorax (20.9%), haemopneumothorax (16.2%), pneumothorax (17.4%) including simple, open and tension types as well as multiple ribs fractures (7.7%) constituted the majority. In the management strategies, conservative methods were mainly used. The outcome ranged from very good to fair.The management of chest injuries in our sub-region like any other developing countries is very much challenging. Concerted efforts are needed to overcome the burden it imposes.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956691","annotations":[{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.884338,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.763945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.607103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.55597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Nigeria","weight":0.543581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria"},{"name":"Teaching hospital","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_hospital"},{"name":"Developing country","weight":0.441771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.354562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.350463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Hemothorax","weight":0.309824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemothorax"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.279122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.115641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Hemopneumothorax","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemopneumothorax"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Arithmetic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Weighted mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean"},{"name":"402","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/402"},{"name":"Rib","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Fair","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair"},{"name":"Medical record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_record"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Chest trauma","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_trauma"},{"name":"Blunt trauma","weight":0.0159005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma"},{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Subregion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subregion"}]}
