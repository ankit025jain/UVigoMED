{"id":68590,"title":"Piwi-like 1 and 4 gene transcript levels are associated with clinicopathological parameters in renal cell carcinomas.","abstract":"Piwi-like gene family members (Piwil 1-4) are considered stem cell-associated genes/proteins. These are expressed predominantly in germline cells, but are re-expressed in different tumors. Piwil 1-4 gene expression has not previously been studied and correlated with clinicopathological parameters in renal cell carcinomas (RCC). The Piwil 1-4 transcript levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR in 73 clear cell RCC (ccRCC) tissues and corresponding normal tissues. The transcript levels of Piwil 1, 2 and 4 were strongly and significantly correlated with each other, in both the tumor tissues and the normal tissues (P<0.001; Spearman's rank test). Piwil 4 gene expression was significantly higher in the ccRCC tissues than that in the corresponding normal renal tissues (P<0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). When the ccRCC patient cohort was divided according to the median Piwil 1-4 expression into low- and high-expression groups and according to age into younger (?64years) and older patient groups (>64years), the younger patients displayed significantly higher levels of Piwil 1 mRNA in comparison to the older patients (P=0.010; Fisher's exact test). Interestingly, Piwil 1 expression was left-right polarized in the normal tissues but not in the tumor tissues (P=0.004; Fisher's exact test). Altogether, associations were determined between the Piwi-like family member expression levels and clinicopathological parameters of ccRCC, suggesting a potential role for these genes/proteins in ccRCC diagnostics and tumorigenesis as well as in renal tissue embryology.","date":"2014-03-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509249","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Embryology","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryology"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.72111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Gene family","weight":0.581414,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_family"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.394337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.369635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.335355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.281115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Renal cell carcinoma","weight":0.122677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Polarization (waves)","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Exact test","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_test"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0243443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Taxonomic rank","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Real-time computing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing"},{"name":"Fishers, Indiana","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishers,_Indiana"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"}]}
