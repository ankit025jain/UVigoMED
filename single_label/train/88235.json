{"id":88235,"title":"The impact of traumatic pelvic fractures on sporting activity and quality of life.","abstract":"Pelvic fractures (PFX) reflect high-energy trauma with high mortality and morbidity.We attempted to determine: whether there is a decrease in levels of sporting and physical activity in patients with operatively-treated PFX; risk factors for decreased sporting activity; any correlation between sporting activity and quality of life in this group.Retrospective demographics on mechanism of injury, fracture type, associated injury and injury severity score, as well as prospective documentation of the level and frequency of sporting activity, were collected from adult patients treated operatively for a PFX between 2007 and 2010, using a specifically designed questionnaire. Quality of life before and after injury was also recorded using the EuroQol-5D health-outcome tool.80 patients without pre-existing musculoskeletal disability were enrolled. The mean age was 44.9 years (18-65). The mean follow-up was 30.5 months (12-39). A decrease in level and frequency of sporting activity was observed. It was associated with lower-extremity associated injuries, but not with injury severity score, PFX severity, PFX type, age, or timing of follow-up. Sporting activity before injury predicted higher levels of sporting participation after injury. Decreased sporting activity after injury was associated with decreased EuroQol-SD score.Patients should be counselled on the likelihood of a reduction in sporting activities after surgically treated PFX. A larger multi-centre study is needed to further expand on the evidence of the true impact of PFX and its associated injuries on sporting activity.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881432","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.771817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.749662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.748309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.533764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.452533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.398625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.315274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Injury Severity Score","weight":0.291559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_Severity_Score"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.193306,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0266575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1865","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1865"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"1239","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1239"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Likelihood function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Sporting Clube de Portugal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Clube_de_Portugal"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"PKCS","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
