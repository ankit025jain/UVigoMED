{"id":82992,"title":"Activation of RANKL-induced osteoclasts and memory T lymphocytes by Porphyromonas gingivalis is serotype dependant.","abstract":"Destructive periodontitis is associated with a Th1-Th17 immune response and activation of RANKL-induced osteoclasts. In addition, Porphyromonas gingivalis K1 and K2 serotypes induce a strong Th1-Th17 response. This study aimed to investigate whether these P. gingivalis serotypes induce higher osteoclasts activation, by increased Th17-associated RANKL production, and an antigen-specific memory T-lymphocyte response.The RANKL production and TRAP(+) osteoclast induction were quantified on na√Øve T lymphocytes stimulated with dendritic cells primed with the P. gingivalis serotypes. The T-bet, GATA-3, RORC2 and Foxp3 expression was correlated with RANKL production. The frequency of proliferating memory T lymphocytes in response to P. gingivalis serotypes was determined in both periodontitis and healthy subjects.T lymphocytes stimulated by K1 or K2-primed dendritic cells elicited higher levels of RANKL and TRAP(+) osteoclasts than cells stimulated with the other serotypes. RANKL positively correlated with RORC2. Whereas periodontitis patients had a higher frequency of memory T lymphocytes responding to K1 or K2, healthy subjects had a higher frequency of memory T lymphocytes responding to K4 or K(-) .P. gingivalis serotypes K1 and K2, but not others, are associated with an increased production of the osteoclastogenesis-related factor RANKL. This important information suggests that these serotypes could elicit a greater bone resorption in vivo and have a role in the periodontitis pathogenesis.","date":"2014-04-08","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476556","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoclast","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoclast"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Bone resorption","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_resorption"},{"name":"RANKL","weight":0.784796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANKL"},{"name":"Memory T cell","weight":0.761062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_T_cell"},{"name":"T cell","weight":0.753434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"},{"name":"Lymphocyte","weight":0.753434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"T helper cell","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.701697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.671469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"T helper 17 cell","weight":0.586343,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_17_cell"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.501239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"FOXP3","weight":0.435303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOXP3"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.423648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Cell division","weight":0.272452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.20327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.200698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"},{"name":"Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartrate-resistant_acid_phosphatase"},{"name":"K2","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2"},{"name":"Nave","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave"},{"name":"Porphyromonas gingivalis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"},{"name":"GATA3","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATA3"},{"name":"Memory","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Primer (paint)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(paint)"},{"name":"GATA transcription factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATA_transcription_factor"},{"name":"Dependant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependant"},{"name":"Vitamin K","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K"},{"name":"Royal Ocean Racing Club","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ocean_Racing_Club"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Thorium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium"},{"name":"Viral load","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
