{"id":16994,"title":"The missing link: family physician perspectives on barriers and enablers to prescribing a new Meningococcal B vaccine and other recommended, non-government funded vaccines.","abstract":"To determine factors influencing Family Physician (FP) uptake of non government-funded vaccines, and to explore FP attitudes towards the introduction and use of a new vaccine to protect against serogroup B meningococcal disease to inform its future introduction into the Australian Immunisation Schedule.Quantitative, self-administered state-wide questionnaire mailed to all FPs in South Australia (n=1786). Results from 523 FP respondents in South Australia, collected between June and October 2013.Self-reported immunisation counselling practices; and knowledge, attitudes and barriers to prescribing of Meningococcal B (Men B) vaccine and other recommended, non-funded immunisations.The response rate was 30% (n=523). While most (59%) respondents had worked in general practice for over 20 years, only 39% of all respondents had ever had personal or professional experience with a case of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). Most FPs (63%) were aware that a meningococcal B vaccine was being developed, and 93% of respondents agreed that this vaccine should be government-funded. FPs ranked Men B vaccine as the highest priority to receive funding of eight currently non-funded immunisation strategies. High vaccine cost and low patient socioeconomic status were identified as definite barriers to prescribing non-funded vaccines by 59% of respondents. Past IMD experience significantly affected attitudes and prescribing practices.IMD, while encountered rarely in clinical practice, is considered an important disease to vaccinate against by FPs. Cost and perceived low socioeconomic status of patients are substantial barriers to FPs prescribing Men B and other non-funded vaccines, and inclusion of such vaccines on the National Immunisation Program is likely to improve equity of access.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923639","annotations":[{"name":"Physician","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.735967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"General practitioner","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Socioeconomics","weight":0.486215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics"},{"name":"Family medicine","weight":0.42749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_medicine"},{"name":"South Australia","weight":0.357443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia"},{"name":"List of counseling topics","weight":0.304822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counseling_topics"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.137717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Socioeconomic status","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Neisseria meningitidis","weight":0.0633088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_meningitidis"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Meningococcal disease","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_disease"},{"name":"523","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/523"},{"name":"1786","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1786"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Cost","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Quantitative research","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Response rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_rate"},{"name":"International nongovernmental organization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_nongovernmental_organization"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"International Institute for Management Development","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Institute_for_Management_Development"},{"name":"Equal opportunity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Transitional fossil","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_fossil"},{"name":"Serotype","weight":0.0107573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotype"}]}
