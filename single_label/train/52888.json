{"id":52888,"title":"Heterogeneity in the quality of care for patients with multiple chronic conditions by psychiatric comorbidity.","abstract":"Little is known about the quality of care received by Medicaid enrollees with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) and whether quality is different for those with mental illness.To examine cancer screening and single-disease quality of care measures in a Medicaid population with MCC and to compare quality measures among persons with MCC with varying medical comorbidities with and without depression or schizophrenia.Secondary data analysis using a unique data source combining Medicaid claims with other administrative datasets from North Carolina's mental health system.Medicaid-enrolled adults aged 18 and older with ?2 of 8 chronic conditions (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, seizure disorder, depression, or schizophrenia). Medicare/Medicaid dual enrollees were excluded due to incomplete data on their medical care utilization.We examined a number of quality measures, including cancer screening, disease-specific metrics, such as receipt of hemoglobin A1C tests for persons with diabetes, and receipt of psychosocial therapies for persons with depression or schizophrenia, and medication adherence.Quality of care metrics was generally lower among those with depression or schizophrenia, and often higher among those with increasing levels of medical comorbidities. A number of exceptions to these trends were noted.Cancer screening and single-disease quality measures may provide a benchmark for overall quality of care for persons with MCC; these measures were generally lower among persons with MCC and mental illness. Further research on quality measures that better reflect the complex care received by persons with MCC is essential.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561748","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.886122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Schizophrenia","weight":0.836841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Psychosocial","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Medicaid","weight":0.765384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.759859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Hyperlipidemia","weight":0.746361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia"},{"name":"Illness","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Epileptic seizure","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizure"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.552443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.219945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Multiprotein complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotein_complex"},{"name":"Secondary data","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_data"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"}]}
