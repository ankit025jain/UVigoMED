{"id":68926,"title":"[CCAFU Recommendations 2013: Upper urinary tract carcinoma].","abstract":"The objective was to update the guidelines of the French Urological Association Cancer Committee for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).A Medline search was performed between 2010 and 2013, as regards diagnosis, options of treatment and follow-up of UTUC, to evaluate different references with levels of evidence.The diagnosis of this rare pathology is based on CT-scan acquisition during excretion and ureteroscopy with histological biopsies. Total nephro-urectomy remains the gold standard for surgical treatment, nevertheless a conservative endoscopic approach can be proposed : unifocal tumour and diameter < 1 cm and low grade and absence of invasion on CT-scan. Close monitoring with endoscopic follow-up (flexible ureteroscope) in compliant patients is therefore necessary.These new guidelines will hopefully contribute not only to improve patient management, but also diagnosis and treatment for UTUC.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485287","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.740654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.685738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.665601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Transitional cell carcinoma","weight":0.601579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Ureteroscopy","weight":0.442662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureteroscopy"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Urothelium","weight":0.147465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urothelium"},{"name":"Excretion","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion"},{"name":"France","weight":0.122601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Gold standard","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
