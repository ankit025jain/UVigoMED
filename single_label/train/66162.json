{"id":66162,"title":"Macro/Nano-gel composite as an injectable and bioactive bulking material for the treatment of urinary incontinence.","abstract":"Many women around the world are suffering from urinary incontinence, defined as the unintentional leakage of urine by external abnormal pressure. Although various kinds of materials have been utilized to treat this disease, therapies that are more effective are still needed for the treatment of urinary incontinence. Here, we present a macro/nanogel composed of in situ forming gelatin-based macrogels and self-assembled heparin-based nanogels, which can serve as an injectable and bioactive bulking material for the treatment of urinary incontinence. The hybrid hydrogels were prepared via enzymatic reaction in the presence of horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide. Incorporating a growth factor (GF)-loaded heparin nanogel into a gelatin gel matrix enabled the hybrid gel matrix to release GF continuously up to 28 days. Moreover, we demonstrated that the hydrogel composites stimulated the regeneration of the urethral muscle tissue surrounding the urethral wall and promoted the recovery of their biological function when injected in vivo. Thus, the macro/nanohydrogels may provide an advanced therapeutic technique for the treatment of urinary incontinence as well as an application for regenerative medicine.
