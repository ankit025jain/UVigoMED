{"id":4195,"title":"Metabolic syndrome in a French cohort of patients with bipolar disorder: results from the FACE-BD cohort.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in a cohort of French patients with bipolar disorder; determine correlations with sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors; and investigate the gap between optimal care and effective care of the treated patients.654 bipolar disorder patients from the FACE-BD cohort were included from 2009 to 2012. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, lifestyle information, and data on antipsychotic treatment and comorbidities were collected, and a blood sample was drawn. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders was used to confirm the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria.18.5% of individuals with bipolar disorder met criteria for MetS. Two-thirds of bipolar disorder patients did not receive adequate treatment for MetS components. Multivariate analysis showed that risk of MetS in men was nearly twice that in women (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.8), and older patients had a 3.5 times higher risk (95% CI, 1.5-7.8) of developing MetS than patients under the age of 35 years. Moreover, patients receiving antipsychotic treatment had a 2.3 times increased risk (95% CI, 1.2-3.5) of having MetS, independent of other potential confounders.The prevalence of MetS is high in bipolar disorder patients, and there was considerable undertreatment of the components of MetS in this population. The prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in these patients should be assessed systematically. The findings highlight the need for integrated care, with more interaction and coordination between psychiatrists and primary care providers.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Nutritional and
