{"id":27387,"title":"A functional variant in APOA5/A4/C3/A1 gene cluster contributes to elevated triglycerides and severity of CAD by interfering with microRNA 3201 binding efficiency.","abstract":"Recent genome-wide association studies identified the APOA5/A4/C3/A1 gene cluster polymorphisms influencing triglyceride level and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).The purposes of this study were to fine-map triglyceride association signals in the APOA5/A4/C3/A1 gene cluster and then explore the clinical relevance in CAD and potential underlying mechanisms.We resequenced the APOA5/A4/C3/A1 gene cluster in 200 patients with extremely high triglyceride levels (?10 mm/l) and 200 healthy control subjects who were ethnically matched and genotyped 20 genetic markers among 4,991 participants with Chinese Han ethnicity. Subsequently, 8 risk markers were investigated in 917 early-onset and 1,149 late-onset CAD patients, respectively. The molecular mechanism was explored.By resequencing, a number of newly and potentially functional variants were identified, and both the common and rare variants have remarkable cumulative effects on hypertriglyceridemia risk. Of note, gene dosage of rs2266788 demonstrated a robust association with triglyceride level (p = 1.39 × 10(-19)), modified Gensini scores (p = 1.67 × 10(-3)), and numbers of vascular lesions in CAD patients (odds ratio: 1.96, 95% confidence interval: 1.31 to 2.14, p = 8.96 × 10(-4)). Functional study demonstrated that the rs2266788 C allele destroyed microRNA 3201 binding to the 3' UTR of APOA5, resulting in prolonging the half-life of APOA5 messenger RNA and increasing its expression levels.Genetic variants in APOA5/A4/C3/A1 gene cluster play an important role in the regulation of plasma triglyceride levels by an increased APOA5 concentration and contribute to the severity of CAD.","date":"2014-07-18","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034063","annotations":[{"name":"Messenger
