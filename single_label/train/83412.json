{"id":83412,"title":"[Clinical application of totally implantable central venous port].","abstract":"To summarize the disposal methods and the reasons of complications in operation of totally implantable central venous port (TICVP).A total of 2 007 patients were enrolled in this observational, single-center study between December 2008 and March 2013. TICVP implantation was performed with one small skin incision and subcutaneous puncture of subclavian or jugular vein. Patient's profiles, indications of port system, early and delayed complications, and disposal methods were evaluated. There were 38 male and 1 969 female patients, aged from 21 to 85 years, with a mean of 47.6 years.The mean duration of the TICVP system was (242 ± 12) days, ranging from 9 to 1 243 days. The achievement rate of puncture in the right jugular vein (99.76%) was the highest. Sonographic approach using the internal jugular vein were better than the external landmark-guided technique (99.80% vs. 96.34%, ?² = 29.905, P = 0.000). The rate of immediate complication was 0.80%, which included pneumothorax, hemothorax, lymphatic fistula and thrombosis. Early complications rate was 0.10%, which included pocket hematoma, catheter migration, venous thrombosis, port pocket infection, fibrin sheath formation. Late complications rate was 7.87%, which included catheter fracture, pinch-off syndrome, catheter-related bloodstream infection, fibrin sheath formation, catheter migration, extravasation, port inversion and port reveal. The rate of removal due to complications was 1.34% (27/2 007), and the early complication was higher (?² = 8.053, P = 0.011).The low incidence of complications suggests that TICVP is safe and reliable for long term intermittent venous access. The results support the use of TICVP in the oncology patients and patients requiring long-term intravenous therapy.","date":"2014-11-05","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25370762","annotations":[{"name":"Hemothorax","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemothorax"},{"name":"Pneumothorax","weight":0.900582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax"},{"name":"Internal jugular vein","weight":0.89756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_jugular_vein"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.891056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.832107,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Subclavian vein","weight":0.805861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclavian_vein"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.801957,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Jugular vein","weight":0.800857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein"},{"name":"Fistula","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.768171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.750864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.748688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Central venous catheter","weight":0.723421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Extravasation","weight":0.629535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravasation"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.531229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.420769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.363497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.331296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Venous thrombosis","weight":0.328887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_thrombosis"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.135885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"}]}
