{"id":37520,"title":"Minimally invasive therapy for fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma: case series and systematic review of the literature.","abstract":"Large solid sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCT) can cause high-output cardiac failure and fetal or neonatal death. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of minimally invasive antenatal procedures for the treatment of fetal SCT.A case review was performed of five fetuses with a large SCT treated antenatally using minimally invasive techniques, and a systematic literature review on fetal therapy for solid SCTs was carried out.Five women were referred between 17?+?5 and 26?+?4 weeks' gestation for a large fetal SCT with evidence of fetal cardiac failure. Vascular flow to the tumors was interrupted by fetoscopic laser ablation (n?=?1), radiofrequency ablation (RFA; n?=?2) or interstitial laser ablation??±??vascular coiling (n?=?2). There were two intrauterine fetal deaths. The other three cases resulted in preterm labor within 10 days of surgery. One neonate died. Two survived without procedure-related complications but had long-term morbidity related to prematurity. The systematic literature review revealed 16 SCTs treated minimally invasively for (early) hydrops. Including our cases, six of 20 hydropic fetuses survived after minimally invasive therapy (30%). Survival after RFA or interstitial laser ablation was 45% (5/11). Of 12 fetuses treated for SCT without obvious hydrops and for which perinatal survival data were available, eight (67%) survived. Mean gestational age at delivery after minimally invasive therapy was 29.7?±?4.0 weeks. Survival after open fetal surgery in hydropic fetuses was 6/11 (55%), with a mean gestational age at delivery of 29.8?±?2.9 weeks.Fetal therapy can potentially improve perinatal outcomes for hydropic fetuses with a solid SCT, but is often complicated by intrauterine death and preterm birth.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24488859","annotations":[{"name":"Sacrococcygeal teratoma","weight":0.907678,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrococcygeal_teratoma"},{"name":"Perinatal mortality","weight":0.865191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinatal_mortality"},{"name":"Radiofrequency ablation","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofrequency_ablation"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Gestation","weight":0.830373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"},{"name":"Prenatal development","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Gestational age","weight":0.813654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Teratoma","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma"},{"name":"Heart failure","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.752758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.731918,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Uterus","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.723003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.715483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Childbirth","weight":0.682402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.631922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.603184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.419099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.408977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hydrops fetalis","weight":0.374979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrops_fetalis"},{"name":"Fetal surgery","weight":0.223931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_surgery"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Fetoscopy","weight":0.183056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetoscopy"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.110987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.0190842,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Survival analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis"},{"name":"Sacrococcygeal symphysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrococcygeal_symphysis"},{"name":"Radio frequency","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency"},{"name":"Interstitial fluid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_fluid"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"}]}
