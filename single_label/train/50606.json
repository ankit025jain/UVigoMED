{"id":50606,"title":"Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and cytotoxicity of recombinant orally-administrated long-lasting GLP-1 and its therapeutic effect on db/db mice.","abstract":"Recombinant orally long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (rolGLP-1), a novel analog of native GLP-1 that can stimulate insulin secretion, was constructed via site-directed mutagenesis by our laboratory. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the cytotoxicity of rolGLP-1. Diabetic db/db mice were given 125I-rolGLP-1 through a single dose of oral administration to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of rolGLP-1 by trichloroacetic acid-Radioactive assay (TCA-RA). Separately, rolGLP-1 was orally administered to the db/db mice daily for 28 days to evaluate its therapeutic effect. In addition, the safety of rolGLP-1 was assessed based on cytotoxicity testing on the cell line SH-SY5Y by both the MTT assay and the cell counts method. The results showed that the half-life of rolGLP-1 in db/db mice was 68.2 h, which is longer than that of native GLP-1. Results after the 28 day treatment showed glucose homeostasis was improved. Furthermore, rolGLP-1 was also proved to mitigate insulin resistance, alleviate hyperinsulinemia and decreased glycosylated hemoglobin content. Lastly, no visible adverse events were observed in cytotoxicity treatments on SH-SY5Y. Our results revealed that oral administration of rolGLP-1 harbored a longer half-life and a good therapeutic effect for type 2 db/db mice. All the results suggest the capacity and safety of rolGLP-1 for further use as an anti-diabetic agent for type 2 diabetes.This study was supported by Project 863 of China (2008AA02Z205).","date":"2014-04-28","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771009","annotations":[{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.854079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.810271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.801236,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.790758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Anti-diabetic medication","weight":0.772981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-diabetic_medication"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.766773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.717082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.712724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.67865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.647355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Hyperinsulinemia","weight":0.637597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinsulinemia"},{"name":"Cytotoxicity","weight":0.635256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxicity"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.563391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.440443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"China","weight":0.350845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Arachidonic acid","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.309057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.236585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mutagenesis","weight":0.217942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Atomic number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"2008 Summer Olympics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Academic administration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_administration"},{"name":"Native plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_plant"},{"name":"Yttrium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium"}]}
