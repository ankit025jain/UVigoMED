{"id":8013,"title":"Rewarming preservation by organ perfusion system for donation after cardiac death liver grafts in pigs.","abstract":"Use of grafts from donors after cardiac death (DCD) would greatly contribute to the expansion of the donor organ pool. However, this requires the development of novel preservation methods to recover the organ from changes due to warm ischemia time (WIT).Porcine livers were perfused with a newly developed machine perfusion (MP) system. The livers were perfused with modified University of Wisconsin solution (UW) - gluconate. All grafts were procured after acute hemorrhagic shock with the ventilator off. For group 1 (n = 6), grafts were procured after WIT of 60 minutes and preserved by hypothermic MP (HMP) for 3 hours. For group 2 (n = 5), grafts were preserved with 2 hours of simple cold storage (SCS) and HMP for 2 hours. For group 3 (n = 6), grafts were preserved with 2 hours of SCS and rewarming up to 25Â°C by MP for 2 hours (RMP). The preserved liver grafts were transplanted orthotopically.The alanine aminotransferase level in perfusate in RMP during perfusion preservation was maintained at less than that of HMP. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase in the 2 hours after reperfusion were significantly lower in group 3. Histologically, the necrosis of hepatocytes was less severe in group 3. The survival rate in group 3 was 2/4, but 0/4 in the other group.RMP is expected to facilitate the recovery of the DCD liver grafts.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Animal
