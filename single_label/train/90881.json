{"id":90881,"title":"[Massive hemoptysis following thoracic aortic rupture: an advancing field].","abstract":"We report the case of a 57-year-old woman who presented with massive hemoptysis and thoracic pain 3 years after the endovascular treatment of a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Emergency work up revealed the presence of an endoleak, leading to the pressurization of the aneurysm sac and its subsequent rupture into the lung parenchyma. The discussion includes presentation, clinical course, diagnosis, complications and new therapeutic options in the management of a massive hemoptysis secondary to aortic rupture. All together, the case and discussion highlight the classical rules of critical care and the recent advances in endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic rupture.
