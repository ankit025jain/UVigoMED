{"id":4496,"title":"[Effect of iodine-containing thyroid hormones on the histostructure of rat liver under the stress].","abstract":"Experiments with 130 outbred male rats weighing 220-250 g have show that stress \"free swimming in a cage\" (FSC) affects the histological structure of the liver as early as in 1 h. FSC occurred in standard plastic cages (5 animals) filled with water to a height of 15 cm and topped with a grid. One hour after FSC (the alarm-stage) caused dystrophy of hepatocytes and increased blood flow to the liver lobules, which also continued at the resistance-stage (48 h after the FSC). At the exhaustion-stage (daily 1-hour stress for 10 days) there were even greater hepatocytes dystrophy, necrosis, and their microcirculatory disturbances in the lobules. The introduction of merkazolil (intragastrically 25 mg/kg for 20 days) per se altered the histostructure of the liver tissue and under stress aggravates the microcirculatory changes, dystrophy and necrosis of the hepatocytes. Small doses of L-thyroxine (intragastrically 1.5-3.0 ?g/kg for 28 days) minimized the histological signes of the liver damage at all stages of the stress response. Consequently, the iodine-containing thyroid hormones limit the disturbance of the microstructure of the liver caused by stress.","date":"2014-12-12","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25509419","annotations":[{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.82547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.729526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.669488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.656281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Fight-or-flight response","weight":0.619099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.512631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Thyroid hormone","weight":0.455312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_hormone"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.422533,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.309215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.282159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Blood flow","weight":0.224085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_flow"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Lobe (anatomy)","weight":0.152612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobe_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Inbreeding","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Retinopathy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinopathy"},{"name":"Forest Stewardship Council","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Stewardship_Council"},{"name":"Cage (enclosure)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_(enclosure)"},{"name":"Five Animals","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Animals"},{"name":"Swimming (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)"},{"name":"Microstructure","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstructure"},{"name":"Illegal per se","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_per_se"}]}
