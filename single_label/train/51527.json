{"id":51527,"title":"Effects of a sucrose-enriched diet on the pattern of gene expression, contraction and Ca(2+) transport in Goto-Kakizaki type 2 diabetic rat heart.","abstract":"There has been a spectacular rise in the global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. A variety of diastolic and systolic dysfunctions have been demonstrated in type 2 diabetic heart. The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has been linked to rising rates of obesity, which in turn is a risk factor for development of T2DM. In this study, the effects of a sucrose-enriched diet on the pattern of gene expression, contraction and Ca(2+) transport in the Goto-Kakizaki T2DM rat heart were investigated. Genes encoding cardiac muscle proteins (Myh7, Mybpc3, Myl1, Myl3 and Mylpf), intercellular proteins (Gja4), cell membrane transport (Atp1b1), calcium channels (Cacna1c, Cacna1g and Cacnb1) and potassium channels (Kcnj11) were upregulated and genes encoding potassium channels (Kcnb1) were downregulated in GK compared with control rats. Genes encoding cardiac muscle proteins (Myh6, Mybpc3 and Tnn2), intercellular proteins (Gja1 and Gja4), intracellular Ca(2+) transport (Atp2a1 and Ryr2), cell membrane transport (Atp1a2 and Atp1b1) and potassium channel proteins (Kcnj2 and Kcnj8) were upregulated and genes encoding cardiac muscle proteins (Myh7) were downregulated in control rats fed sucrose compared with control rats. Genes encoding cardiac muscle proteins (Myh7) and potassium channel proteins (Kcnj11) were downregulated in control and GK rats fed sucrose compared with control and GK rats, respectively. The amplitude of shortening was reduced in myocytes from the control-sucrose group compared with control rats and in the GK-sucrose group compared with GK rats. The amplitude of the Ca(2+) transient was increased in myocytes from control-sucrose compared with control rats and decreased in GK-sucrose compared with GK rats. Subtle alterations in the pattern of expression of genes encoding a variety of cardiac muscle proteins are associated with changes in shortening and intracellular Ca(2+) transport in ventricular myocytes from GK T2DM and control rats fed a sucrose-enriched diet.","date":"2014-06-03","categories":"Endocrine System
