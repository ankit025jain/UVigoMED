{"id":68850,"title":"Retroperitoneal laparoscopic technique in treatment of complex renal stones: 75 cases.","abstract":"In most hospitals, several options for the management of renal stones are available: shockwave lithotripsy, endourologic treatment, or surgery. Choice of treatment is based on the anatomic characteristics of the patient, and the location and size of the stones. In this study we assessed a retroperitoneal laparoscopic technique for treatment of complex renal stones.Seventy-five patients, including 53 men and 22 women with a mean age of 47.8 years (range 18-74 y), underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopy for the treatment of complex renal stones between July 2006 and November 2012 in our hospital.The retroperitoneal laparoscopic procedures for treatment of complex renal stones were completely successful in 73 cases, while 2 cases converted to open surgery. The operative time was 85-190 min with a mean of 96 min. The estimated blood lost was 20-400 mL with a mean of 80 mL. After the operation 7 patients experienced urinary leakage. Ultrasonography, x-ray of the kidney, ureter and bladder, and intravenous urography were reviewed at post-procedural follow-up at 6-82 months. No hydronephrosis aggravation was found, and there was no calculus recurrence.The merits of retroperitoneal laparoscopy for the treatment of complex renal stones include sparing the nephron, less bleeding, short hospitalization, quick postoperative recovery, and controllable procedure after training Success depends on the experience of surgeons and judicious selection of cases.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491207","annotations":[{"name":"Ureter","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"},{"name":"Hydronephrosis","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronephrosis"},{"name":"Intravenous pyelogram","weight":0.86732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_pyelogram"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.847827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Laparoscopy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopy"},{"name":"Retroperitoneal space","weight":0.793245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.759037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Kidney stone","weight":0.745757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.740761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Urinary bladder","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.700536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.697137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.690093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Lithotripsy","weight":0.687584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotripsy"},{"name":"Nephron","weight":0.685117,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephron"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Calculus","weight":0.333012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.141231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Religious conversion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_conversion"},{"name":"Shock wave","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Sexual differentiation","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_differentiation"}]}
