{"id":24106,"title":"Anti-biofilm agents: recent breakthrough against multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus.","abstract":"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that causes potentially life-threatening nosocomial- and community-acquired infections, such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis. Staphylococcus aureus has the ability to form multicellular, surface-adherent communities called biofilms, which enables it to survive in various sources of stress, including antibiotics, nutrient limitations, heat shock, and immune responses. Biofilm-forming capacity is now recognized as an important virulence determinant in the development of staphylococcal device-related infections. In light of the projected increase in the numbers of elderly patients who will require semi-permanent indwelling medical devices such as artificial knees and hips, we can anticipate an expanded need for new agents and treatment options to manage biofilm-associated infections in an expanding at-risk population. With better understanding of staphylococcal biofilm formation and growth, novel strategies that target biofilm-associated infections caused by S. aureus have recently been described and seem promising as future anti-biofilm therapies.","date":"2014-04-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453168","annotations":[{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Staphylococcus aureus","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"},{"name":"Osteomyelitis","weight":0.825798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Nutrient","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"},{"name":"Virulence","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Nosocomial infection","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosocomial_infection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.736795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Staphylococcus","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.694376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Multicellular organism","weight":0.646519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.640191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.636795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.526066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.487908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Biological agent","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Heat shock","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
