{"id":24206,"title":"Documenting immunization of children in a cochlear implant program.","abstract":"Assess the effectiveness of an immunization verification protocol (IVP) to achieve and document pneumococcal vaccination of patients with cochlear implants.Chart review.Academic tertiary medical center.Pediatric patients with cochlear implants (n = 76).1) Status of pneumococcal immunization for cochlear implant patients, before and after initiation of the IVP; 2) final number of existing cochlear implant patients successfully immunized after institution of the IVP; and 3) effectiveness of communication between our office and patient/parent or pediatrician.Subjects were grouped according to whether their cochlear implantation was performed before (Group 1, n = 63) or after (Group 2, n = 18) initiation of the IVP in September 2010. In the 28 months between IVP initiation and January 2013, the number of fully immunized age-eligible patients increased in Group 1 from 2% (n = 1) to 63% (n = 40). Of 18 subjects in Group 2, 56% (n = 10) were fully vaccinated at the time of surgery, and 94% were fully vaccinated at the conclusion of the study (n = 17). Of all 81 children, complete immunization was documented in 70% (n = 57), incomplete documentation was noted in 16% (n = 13); and 14% (n = 11) were lost to follow-up.It is a challenge to achieve and document immunizations recommended for cochlear implantation, even in a relatively small cochlear implant program. In our practice, those patients who were required to document immunizations before surgery had the highest rates of compliance. Access to a vaccination registry and the ability to administer vaccines in the otolaryngology office also improved compliance.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448284","annotations":[{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Vaccine","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Streptococcus pneumoniae","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae"},{"name":"Vaccination","weight":0.758056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination"},{"name":"Immunization","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.638095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.611812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cochlear implant","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.204301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Communication","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0246741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"Dental implant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Nursing assessment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_assessment"},{"name":"Compliance (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States Senate elections, 2012","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2012"},{"name":"Tertiary care","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_care"},{"name":"Document","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document"},{"name":"Documentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Institution","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution"},{"name":"Intravenous pyelogram","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_pyelogram"},{"name":"Windows Registry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry"}]}
