{"id":86895,"title":"[A neonate with acute liver failure caused by herpes simplex infection].","abstract":"(HSV) infection in neonates is rare. This infection is generally considered when there is a history of contact with a person who has a cold sore or when the mother has active genital herpes.A 7-day-old female was admitted to hospital on suspicion of sepsis. Aciclovir was considered, but ultimately not given due to low suspicion of herpes infection. Her clinical situation deteriorated within a couple of days. Due to the advanced liver damage, the disease had a fulminant course and the patient died.Even without evidence of contact with HSV in the history, it is important to start acyclovir early in neonates with fever of unknown origin. A rare clinical presentation is acute liver failure. HSV infection can run a serious course in neonates; therefore, aciclovir should be started immediately if there is any suspicion.","date":"2014-09-24","categories":"Virus Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248731","annotations":[{"name":"Aciclovir","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aciclovir"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Herpes genitalis","weight":0.874299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_genitalis"},{"name":"Herpes simplex virus","weight":0.81546,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.785518,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Herpes labialis","weight":0.764996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_labialis"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Neonate","weight":0.741852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonate"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Common cold","weight":0.715228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Hepatotoxicity","weight":0.648874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.626967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.611555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.601443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.490535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Fulminant","weight":0.249467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant"},{"name":"Acute liver failure","weight":0.187718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Fever of unknown origin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever_of_unknown_origin"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"European colonization of the Americas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
