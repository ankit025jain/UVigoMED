{"id":72630,"title":"Technologist-performed handheld screening breast US imaging: how is it performed and what are the outcomes to date?","abstract":"Breast density-inform legislation is increasing the need for data on outcomes of tailored screening. Dense parenchyma can mask cancers, and denser tissue is also more likely to develop breast cancer than fatty tissue. Digital mammography is standard for women with dense breasts. Supplemental screening magnetic resonance imaging should be offered to women who meet high-risk criteria. Supplemental screening ultrasonographic (US) imaging may be appropriate in the much larger group of women with dense breasts. Both physician- and technologist-performed screening US imaging increases detection of node-negative invasive breast cancer. To meet anticipated demand in the United States, screening US images will most likely be acquired by trained technologists rather than physicians. While automated US offers standard documentation, there are few data on outcomes. US has been used diagnostically for decades to characterize masses seen by using mammography, but training specific to screening has been lacking. Standard approaches to training and documentation of technologist-performed handheld screening US imaging are needed. This article reviews the current status of technologist-performed handheld screening breast US imaging.","date":"2014-06-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956046","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.826759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.740234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.643002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.641541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.62637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.579861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.493336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Adipose tissue","weight":0.468348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.399681,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Mammography","weight":0.331707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography"},{"name":"Parenchyma","weight":0.306715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.296142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.149429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Density","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"},{"name":"Digital mammography","weight":0.108635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mammography"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0604488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Legislation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Digital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Mask","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Mobile device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Technical standard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard"}]}
