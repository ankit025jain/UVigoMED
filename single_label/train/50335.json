{"id":50335,"title":"Thirty-day mortality risk associated with the postoperative nonresumption of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: a retrospective study of the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System.","abstract":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are a widely used class of cardiovascular medication. However, limited data exist on the risks of postoperative nonresumption of an ACE-I.To evaluate the factors and 30-day mortality risks associated with the postoperative nonresumption of an ACE-I.A retrospective cohort study.Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System.A total of 294,505 admissions in 240,978 patients with multiple preoperative prescription refills (>3) for an ACE-I who underwent inpatient surgery from calendar years 1999 to 2012.None.We classified surgical admissions based upon the timing of postoperative resumption of an ACE-I prescription from the day of surgery through postoperative days 0 to 14 and 15 to 30, and collected 30-day mortality data. We evaluated the relationship between 30-day mortality and the nonresumption of an ACE-I from postoperative day 0 to 14 using proportional hazard regression models, adjusting for patient- and hospital-level risk factors. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using more homogeneous subpopulations and propensity score models.Twenty-five percent of our cohort did not resume an ACE-I during the 14 days following surgery. Nonresumption of an ACE-I within postoperative day 0 to 14 was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality (hazard ratio: 3.44; 95% confidence interval: 3.30-3.60; P < 0.001) compared to the restart group. Sensitivity analyses maintained this relationship.Nonresumption of an ACE-I is common after major inpatient surgery in the large VA Health Care System. Restarting of an ACE-I within postoperative day 0 to 14 is, however, associated with decreased 30-day mortality. Careful attention to the issue of timely reinstitution of chronic medications such as an ACE-I is indicated.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799360","annotations":[{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.90351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.804534,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.676157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.609634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.550962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.550097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.462256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.445085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.440148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.400359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Health care system","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Statistical population","weight":0.157879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.142846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.117545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0934771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.0624462,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"ACE inhibitor","weight":0.0504415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor"},{"name":"United States Department of Veterans Affairs","weight":0.0465037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Propensity score","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.0200776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Calendar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Statistical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model"},{"name":"Social class","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"}]}
