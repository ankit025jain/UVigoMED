{"id":4725,"title":"The oral health status and the treatment needs in Chad: a pilot study.","abstract":"This study was designed to evaluate dental conditions, factors contributing to these conditions, and treatment needs among a population from different places in Chad, as part of a general assessment of their oral health.A cross-sectional nationwide survey was conducted with 1,011 participants. The survey consisted of a brief health interview (conducted by dental students and public health specialists) followed by a 1-2 minutes oral examination (conducted by dental students and dentists).Sixty four per cent of the subjects had experienced dental pain, 66.7% had decayed teeth, and 56.6% had gum diseases. Dental pain was found to be distributed according to age, gender and locations (p<0.001). Only 25% of the participants had ever visited a dentist. Males were show to engage in more tobacco use than females (19.2% vs. 0.3%), while females were more likely to have visited a dentist than males (30.8% vs. 22.8%). Brushing of teeth occurred more often in urban than in rural locations (p<0.001), while date, sugar cane and cola nut intake were statistically significant in the older generation compared to the younger subjects (p<0.001).There was a significant need for dental treatment and care in the sample population. In addition, the availability of sugar, combined with poor knowledge, utilisation of preventive and restorative oral health care services have been contributed to have several dental conditions.","date":"2014-10-21","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25331242","annotations":[{"name":"Health care","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Dentist","weight":0.667086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.633539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Tobacco","weight":0.614946,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco"},{"name":"Sugarcane","weight":0.604279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcane"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.45983,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.459539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.452096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.345463,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Sugar","weight":0.339796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.321397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.307594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.28687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.231041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Toothache","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothache"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Dental surgery","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_surgery"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Nut (fruit)","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)"},{"name":"Public","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public"},{"name":"Chewing gum","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum"},{"name":"Cola","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola"},{"name":"Chad","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad"},{"name":"Toothbrush","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush"},{"name":"Electricity generation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"Utilisation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisation"},{"name":"United States dollar","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"},{"name":"Sampling (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)"}]}
