{"id":89060,"title":"A prospective study of pediatric hand fractures and review of the literature.","abstract":"Hand fractures represent a leading cause of morbidity in children. However, little information exists correlating the mechanisms and environment of injury with outcomes and treatments. We examine the demographics, etiology, anatomic location, mechanism, and management of pediatric hand fractures in our center's hand unit.We conducted a prospective observational study on all children with acute hand fractures evaluated in the Plastic Surgery Emergency Clinic during a 3-month period in 2010. Data pertaining to demographics, referral patterns, injury pattern, clinical outcomes, and other factors related to hand fractures were then analyzed and interpreted.Most children were referred by our institution's emergency department. More than 60% were boys, and nearly half were between 10 and 15 years old. The right and left hands were injured at equal rates. Most of the injuries (90%) occurred in the afternoon or evening. More than 85% occurred in urban, rather than rural, environments. Crush injuries were the leading cause in toddlers, whereas sports-related injuries became the major cause of injury in older groups. Proximal phalanges were the most common bone injured, and the fifth digit was the most commonly injured digit. More than 80% of the fractures were managed nonsurgically.The pattern of pediatric hand fracture in different age groups is highlighted in this article. The observations from this study will hopefully encourage further review with a larger cohort and a focus on preventative measures for pediatric hand fractures.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24759492","annotations":[{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.829478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.752284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.682332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.582972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.548787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.513105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.508249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Plastic surgery","weight":0.483475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.297796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.284698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.236367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.136736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Plastic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0631388,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0538916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Phalanx bone","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone"},{"name":"Toddler","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0265028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"2010","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010"},{"name":"Interpreter (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Academic major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Digit (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Proximal phalanges","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_phalanges"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Fifth toe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_toe"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
