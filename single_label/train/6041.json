{"id":6041,"title":"A clinical survey of common avian infectious diseases in China.","abstract":"Multiple common avian infectious diseases (CAIDs), namely, avian infectious diseases excluding highly pathogenic avian influenza and Newcastle disease, such as avian salmonellosis and coccidiosis, cause huge economic loss in poultry production and are of great significance in public health. However, they are usually not covered in the systems for reporting of animal diseases. Consequently, the distribution of CAIDs is not clear in many countries. Here, we report a clinical survey of CAIDs in China based on clinical diagnosis of eight veterinary clinics in 2011 and 2012. This survey provided the distribution data of viral, bacterial, and parasitic CAIDs in different types of avian flocks, seasons, and regions, data that are of great value in the research, prevention, and control of poultry diseases. This survey suggested that avian colibacillosis, infectious serositis in ducks caused by Riemerella anatipestifer, avian salmonellosis, fowl cholera, avian mycoplasmosis, avian aspergillosis, coccidiosis, low pathogenic avian influenza, infectious bronchitis, infectious bursal disease, and infectious laryngotracheitis are likely to be prevalent in the poultry in China.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25055636","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"Cholera","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera"},{"name":"Avian influenza","weight":0.860897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza"},{"name":"Newcastle disease","weight":0.81041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_disease"},{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.793294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Poultry","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.769644,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Bronchitis","weight":0.758552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis"},{"name":"Mycoplasma","weight":0.75459,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.723806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Veterinary medicine","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Medical diagnosis","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.655011,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Salmonellosis","weight":0.602471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonellosis"},{"name":"China","weight":0.568012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.491925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Bird","weight":0.395599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"},{"name":"Coccidia","weight":0.377274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidia"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.284114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Duck","weight":0.197058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck"},{"name":"Fowl","weight":0.144872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Herd","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
