{"id":65506,"title":"Measurement of aberrant glycosylation of prostate specific antigen can improve specificity in early detection of prostate cancer.","abstract":"We previously identified prostate cancer (PCa)-associated aberrant glycosylation of PSA, where ?2,3-linked sialylation is an additional terminal N-glycan on free PSA (S2,3PSA). We then developed a new assay system measuring S2,3PSA using a magnetic microbead-based immunoassay. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of conventional PSA and percent-free PSA (%fPSA) tests.We used MagPlex beads to measure serum S2,3PSA levels using anti-human fPSA monoclonal antibody (8A6) for capture and anti-?2,3-linked sialic acid monoclonal antibody (HYB4) for detection. We determined the cutoff values in a training test and measured serum S2,3PSA levels in 314 patients who underwent biopsy, including 138 PCa and 176 non-PCa patients with PSA of <10.0 ng/ml. Serum S2,3PSA levels were presented as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of total PSA, %fPSA, and S2,3PSA.We determined an MFI cutoff value of 1130 with a sensitivity of 95.0% and specificity of 72.0% for the diagnosis of PCa in the training test. In the validation study, the area under the curve for the detection of PCa with S2,3PSA was 0.84, which was significantly higher than that with PSA or %fPSA.Although the present study is small and preliminary, these results suggest that the measurement of serum S2,3PSA using a magnetic microbead-based immunoassay may improve the accuracy of early detection of PCa and reduce unnecessary prostate biopsy.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814705","annotations":[{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.886648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Sialic acid","weight":0.884812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialic_acid"},{"name":"Prostate-specific antigen","weight":0.858295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.844774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Immunoassay","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.798982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.78205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.779765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.766341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.708774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.630477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.519298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.289532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"A6 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A6_road_(England)"},{"name":"Prostate biopsy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_biopsy"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0284659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Bead","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bead"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"1130","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1130"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Method of characteristics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_characteristics"},{"name":"Sial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sial"},{"name":"MFI Group","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFI_Group"},{"name":"Misanthropy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Terminal illness","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_illness"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"}]}
