{"id":87137,"title":"Epidemiology of sexual health in the virtual environment: a multinational online survey of Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking men who use an internet sexual networking site.","abstract":"There is limited data on the sexual health of users of sexual networking websites for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Latin America. Members of a MSM-targeted social/sexual networking website in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal participated in an online sexual health survey. Among 36,063 respondents, nearly 90 % reported having anal or vaginal intercourse in the past 3 months. Among sexually active men, 53.2 % used condoms inconsistently. In the past year, 54 % of respondents reported undergoing sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing and 67 % reported testing yearly or more often for HIV. Self-reported HIV prevalence was 9.1 %. Differences were seen by geographic region. Unprotected intercourse with partners of different or unknown HIV status was associated with recent STI diagnosis (OR = 1.83, t = 13.15, d.f. = 21, p < .001) and HIV diagnosis (OR = 2.20, t = 14.00, d.f. = 21, p < .001). Online surveys are a promising tool for HIV/STI surveillance and prevention internationally to reach an important subset of MSM.
