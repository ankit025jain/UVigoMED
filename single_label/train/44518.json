{"id":44518,"title":"Epimorphin(-/-) mice are protected, in part, from acute colitis via decreased interleukin 6 signaling.","abstract":"Epimorphin (Epim), a member of the syntaxin family of membrane-bound, intracellular vesicle-docking proteins, is expressed in intestinal myofibroblasts and macrophages. We demonstrated previously that Epimorphin(-/-)(Epim(-/-)) mice are protected, in part, from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Although interleukin (IL)-6/p-Stat3 signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of colitis, the myofibroblast contribution to IL-6 signaling in colitis remains unexplored. Our aim was to investigate the IL-6 pathway in Epim(-/-) mice in the DSS colitis model. Whole colonic tissue, epithelium, and stroma of WT and congenic Epim(-/-) mice treated with 5% DSS for 7 days were analyzed for IL-6 and a downstream effector, p-Stat3, by immunostaining and immunoblot. Colonic myofibroblast and peritoneal macrophage IL-6 secretion were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-6 and p-Stat3 expression were decreased in Epim(-/-) vs WT colon. A relative increase in stromal vs epithelial p-Stat3 expression was observed in WT mice but not in Epim(-/-) mice. Epim deletion abrogates IL-6 secretion from colonic myofibroblasts treated with IL-1? and decreases IL-6 secretion from peritoneal macrophages in a subset of DSS-treated mice. Epim deletion inhibits IL-6 secretion most profoundly from colonic myofibroblasts. Distribution of Stat3 activation is altered in DSS-treated Epim(-/-) mice. Our findings support the notion that myofibroblasts modulate IL-6/p-Stat3 signaling in DSS-treated Epim(-/-) mice.","date":"2014-06-16","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731292","annotations":[{"name":"Macrophage","weight":0.877442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage"},{"name":"Interleukin 6","weight":0.872009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6"},{"name":"Intracellular","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.801888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.75445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Secretion","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretion"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.747118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"IL1A","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IL1A"},{"name":"Stromal cell","weight":0.723122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.677484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.638739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Myofibroblast","weight":0.611663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblast"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.604709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.530405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"STAT3","weight":0.360845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAT3"},{"name":"Sulfate","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Immunostaining","weight":0.279258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunostaining"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.266363,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Peritoneum","weight":0.262436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum"},{"name":"Colitis","weight":0.110833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colitis"},{"name":"Deletion (genetics)","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics)"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Sodium sulfate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_sulfate"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Effector (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effector_(biology)"}]}
