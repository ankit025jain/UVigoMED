{"id":23502,"title":"[Preliminary study on features of syndrome distribution and cluster analysis for AIDS patients with pulmonary infection].","abstract":"To investigate Chinese medical features of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with pulmonary infection.Using cluster analysis method, Chinese medical syndromes of 196 AIDS patients with pulmonary infection were analyzed. The distribution features of each syndrome type were analyzed according to the severity and CD4+ numerical analysis.Basic Chinese medical syndrome types could be summed up as three kinds: exterior invasion of wind heat and phlegm heat obstructing Fei syndrome (61 cases, 31.1%), Fei-Pi deficiency and Fei stagnation of phlegm syndrome (64 cases, 32.7%), Fei-Shen deficiency and yin deficiency induced inner heat syndrome (71 cases, 36.2%). There was statistical difference in the severity degree and the distribution of CD4 among the three syndrome types (P < 0.05).AIDS patients with pulmonary infection involve Fei, Shen, and Pi. The pathogenic factors were related to \"wind\", \"heat\", \"phlegm\", and \"xu\". The Chinese medical syndrome distribution was closely correlated with patients' immunity.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24483107","annotations":[{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.697488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.657965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.51624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Phlegm","weight":0.47816,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegm"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.444394,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"China","weight":0.434076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.394015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Immunodeficiency","weight":0.166125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.130777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.11317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Numerical analysis","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis"},{"name":"CD4","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD4"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Yin and yang","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang"},{"name":"Pi","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi"},{"name":"Cluster analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis"},{"name":"Wind","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"196","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/196"},{"name":"Vitamin B6","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Tummo","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tummo"},{"name":"Computer cluster","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"}]}
