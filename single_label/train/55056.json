{"id":55056,"title":"[Impacts of rotating or lifting-thrusting manipulation on distant vision of naked eye in patients of juvenile myopia: a randomized controlled trial].","abstract":"To compare the differences in the efficacy on distant version of naked eye in the patients of juvenile myopia between rotating manipulation and lifting-thrusting manipulation of acupuncture.One hundred and twenty cases (240 eyes) were randomized into a rotating manipulation group and a lifting-thrusting manipulation group, 60 cases (120 eyes) in each group. Additionally, a corrective lenses group, 60 cases (120 eyes), was set up as the control. In both manipulation groups, Cuanzhu (BL 2),Yuyao (EX-HN 4), Sizhukong (TE 23), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Fengchi (GB 20), Zusanli (ST 36), Guangming (GB 37) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6) were punctured, but stimulated with rotating manipulation and lifting-thrusting manipulation respectively three times per week, 10 times as a treatment session and totally one session was required. In the corrective lenses group, the glasses were applied at daytime. The clinical efficacy and the changes in distant vision of naked eye before and after treatment were compared among the three groups.The total effective rate was 87.5% (105/120) in the rotating manipulation group, which was better than 69.2% (83/120) in the lifting-thrusting manipulation group (P < 0.05). The distant vision of naked eye was improved apparently in the rotating manipulation group and the lifting-thrusting manipulation group after treatment (both P < 0.05). But it was not improved in the corrective lenses group (P > 0.05). The distant vision of naked eye was improved more apparently after treatment in the rotating manipulation group as compared with that in the lifting-thrusting manipulation group (0.75 +/- 0.23 vs 0.68 +/- 0.24, P < 0.05). For 96 cases (192 eyes) with acupuncture treatment, in 3-month follow-up, 87.0% (167/192) of the cases maintained the stable vision as the original level and 13.0% (25/192) of them were reduced in the vision In the acupuncture groups, it was found that the improvement of distant vision of naked eye was more obvious after treatment with younger age, better basic vision and shorter duration of sickness (all P < 0.05).Acupuncture achieves the positive and sustainable clinical effect on juvenile myopia, and the results of rotating manipulation are superior to that of lifting-thrusting manipulation. Age, basic vision and duration of sickness impact the clinical efficacy.","date":"2014-07-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25022120","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.898663,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Myopia","weight":0.881054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia"},{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.548665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.458966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Corrective lens","weight":0.439582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_lens"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.417046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.411096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Glasses","weight":0.359536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.10626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Yuyao","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuyao"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Rotation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"},{"name":"240","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Tight end","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Great Britain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain"},{"name":"British Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library"},{"name":"Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Naked eye","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Sustainability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"},{"name":"Guangming New District","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangming_New_District"}]}
