{"id":50280,"title":"Community screening for pre-diabetes and diabetes using HbA1c levels in high-risk African Americans and Latinos.","abstract":"To evaluate community screening using HbA1c levels in high risk African Americans and Latinos in those not known to have diabetes.HbA1c levels were measured in 1542 African Americans and Latinos aged > or = 40 years with one or more of the following risk factors: family history in first degree relatives, waist circumference > or = 40 inches in males or > or = 35 inches in females, and hypertension, either treatment for or a measured BP of > or = 140/ 90 mm Hg. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were offered to those meeting the HbA1c criterion for pre-diabetes.Churches, community health fares, senior citizen sites.People without known diabetes.Proportion of people meeting the HbA1c criteria for prediabetes (5.8-6.4%) and diabetes (> or = 6.5%).32% had one, 50% had two and 18% had three risk factors. By HbA1c criteria, 40% had pre-diabetes and 25% had diabetes. Increased waist circumference was the most common risk factor followed by a positive family history, and lastly, hypertension. Each individual risk factor was significantly (P < .001) and progressively more common as glycemia increased. Each additional risk factor increased the odds of pre-diabetes or diabetes by 2- to 4-fold. In individuals with pre-diabetes who underwent an OGTT, 59% were normal, 35% had pre-diabetes and only 6% had diabetes.Community screening of high risk African Americans and Latinos with HbA1c levels identifies a large proportion of people with pre-diabetes and diabetes. Those identified with pre-diabetes are unlikely to meet the OGTT criteria for diabetes.","date":"2014-05-08","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24804366","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.797098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.680657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.626891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.532809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.471531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.372605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.246458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Mercury (element)","weight":0.155517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Hispanic and Latino Americans","weight":0.139429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans"},{"name":"Family history","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history"},{"name":"Circumference","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.105556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Impaired glucose tolerance","weight":0.104215,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impaired_glucose_tolerance"},{"name":"Citizenship","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0400999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Community health","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health"},{"name":"Prediabetes","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediabetes"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Church (building)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(building)"},{"name":"BP","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP"},{"name":"Waist","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Torr","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torr"},{"name":"1542","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1542"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Proportionality (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Bachelor's degree","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree"},{"name":"People (magazine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)"},{"name":"Twelfth grade","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_grade"},{"name":"Waistline (clothing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waistline_(clothing)"},{"name":"Glucose tolerance test","weight":0.0163827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test"},{"name":"Toleration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleration"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
