{"id":62751,"title":"Associations between UGT1A1*6 or UGT1A1*6/*28 polymorphisms and irinotecan-induced neutropenia in Asian cancer patients.","abstract":"Neutropenia is a life-threatening side effect of irinotecan, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) gene polymorphisms are considered to be one of the predictive markers of irinotecan-related toxicities. Many studies have demonstrated that patients bearing UGT1A1*28 have a higher risk of severe neutropenia on toxicity of irinotecan. However, UGT1A1 (TA7/TA7) was very rare in Asian populations. Some researches reported that UGT1A1*28 and/or UGT1A1*6 could predict irinotecan-induced toxicities in Asian populations, but controversial conclusions still remained. This study aims to investigate the association between UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms *6, *6/*28 and irinotecan-related neutropenia in Asian cancer patients receiving irinotecan regimen chemotherapy.Meta-analyses were done to assess the relationship between UGT1A1*6 or UGT1A1*6/*28 and irinotecan-induced neutropenia.The risk of neutropenia was significantly higher among patients with a UGT1A1*6 genotype than among those carrying the UGT1A1*1 allele(s) [odds ratio (OR) 3.276; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.887-5.688; P = 0.000 (*6/*6 vs. *1/*6 or *1/*1)], [OR 1.542; 95 % CI 1.180-2.041; P = 0.001 (*6/*6 or *1/*6 vs. *1/*1)]. Also, the risk was significantly higher among patients with a UGT1A1*6/*28 than among those carrying the UGT1A1*1 allele(s) [OR 3.275; 95 % CI 2.152-4.983; P = 0.000 (*6/*6 or *28/*28 or *6/*28 vs. *1/*6 or *1/*28 or *1/*1)].In conclusion, the UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*6/*28 genotypes were associated with an increased risk of irinotecan-induced neutropenia in Asian cancer patients.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24519753","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.807574,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.782137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.773497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.763844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Allele","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.710201,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.689373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Uridine","weight":0.671512,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uridine"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.411965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Glucuronosyltransferase","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronosyltransferase"},{"name":"UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1","weight":0.215812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_glucuronosyltransferase_1_family,_polypeptide_A1"},{"name":"Irinotecan","weight":0.208635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Pyrophosphate","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophosphate"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"A16 road (England)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A16_road_(England)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"1802","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1802"},{"name":"688","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/688"},{"name":"1628","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1628"},{"name":"628","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/628"},{"name":"983","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/983"},{"name":"1524","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1524"},{"name":"276","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/276"},{"name":"275","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/275"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Territorial Army (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Uridine diphosphate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uridine_diphosphate"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"A roads in Zone 1 of the Great Britain numbering scheme","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_roads_in_Zone_1_of_the_Great_Britain_numbering_scheme"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"A11 road (England)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A11_road_(England)"}]}
