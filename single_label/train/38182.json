{"id":38182,"title":"[Surgical treatment of festoons].","abstract":"The well introduced surgical techniques of lower lid blepharoplasty can only repair aesthetic problems between the lid margin and the orbital rim. The neighbouring malar area is located outside the orbit and requires specialised procedures to reposition the sunken malar orbicularis muscle (festoon) and the malar fat pad. A small incision at the lateral canthus provides the access to combine three procedures: transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty, lateral canthoplasty and malar lift.
