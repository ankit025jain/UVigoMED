{"id":81423,"title":"Prevention and nonsurgical management of dental caries over the life course for individuals with special health care needs.","abstract":"Traditional approaches to caries prevention and management are unlikely to result in successful outcomes for individuals with special health care needs. Intensive prevention-oriented and minimally invasive restorative approaches have the greatest potential to address oral health disparities affecting vulnerable populations. This paper introduces readers to oral health-related issues for patients with special health care needs across the life course and outlines clinical strategies to prevent and manage caries in high-risk patients.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076628","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.692772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.523244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.503812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.299762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.262303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.211952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.180556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"Health equity","weight":0.158593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Vulnerable species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"},{"name":"Tradition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition"},{"name":"Social inequality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality"}]}
