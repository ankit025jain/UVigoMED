{"id":25362,"title":"Cardiac imaging in the geriatric population: what do we think we know, and what do we need to learn?","abstract":"Cardiac imaging plays an important role in coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (HF) and valvular heart disease (VHD) in the elderly. Imaging defines the structure and function of the cardiac system, refining the understanding of patients' anatomy and physiology and informing a host of clinical care decisions, including prognosis. Yet there is a paucity of evidence to guide the rational use of many imaging modalities in patients of advanced age, a population with considerable clinical heterogeneity, high prevalence and burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and atypical presentations of CVD. This paper discusses important considerations for cardiac imaging for older adults, particularly in regard to CAD, VHD and HF, and then presents domains for future research to produce data that would inform clinical care guidelines, appropriate use criteria and imaging lab protocols to address the unique needs of the fast-growing elderly population.
