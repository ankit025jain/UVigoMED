{"id":80496,"title":"Prevalence of intestinal protozoan infections among Orang Asli schoolchildren in Pos Senderut, Pahang, Malaysia.","abstract":"The current study determined the prevalence of intestinal protozoan infections among the Orang Asli schoolchildren in Pos Senderut, Pahang, Malaysia. The overall intestinal protozoan infection rate was 85% (261 out of 307). The highest prevalence rates were due to Entamoeba coli (24.4%), Giardia lamblia (21.8%), Blastocystis hominis (21.2%) and Entamoeba histolytica (15.0%). The prevalence of Iodamoeba butschlii was only 2.9%. Among the positive samples, mixed infection with B. hominis and E. histolytica was 3.3%, B. hominis and G. lamblia was 2.9%, G. lamblia and E. histolytica was 2.0% and triple infections (B. hominis, G. lamblia and E. histolytica) was 1.0 %. The prevalence of the infection was high in all age groups (6-14 years old). Thus, we can conclude that intestinal protozoan infections are still representing a serious public health problem in aboriginal communities, especially among children.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640856","annotations":[{"name":"Giardia lamblia","weight":0.921198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giardia_lamblia"},{"name":"Entamoeba histolytica","weight":0.900688,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba_histolytica"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Protozoa","weight":0.697293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"},{"name":"Giardia","weight":0.671581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giardia"},{"name":"Blastocystis","weight":0.440992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocystis"},{"name":"Protozoan infection","weight":0.415992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoan_infection"},{"name":"Public health","weight":0.21466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Malaysia","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0471248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Pahang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahang"},{"name":"Entamoeba coli","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba_coli"},{"name":"Orang Asli","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_Asli"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"261","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/261"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Aboriginal peoples in Canada","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada"},{"name":"Triple (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Orang (North Korea)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_(North_Korea)"},{"name":"Minuscule 614","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_614"},{"name":"Entamoeba","weight":0.0120594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba"}]}
