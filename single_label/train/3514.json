{"id":3514,"title":"Ultrasonography evaluation of scrotal masses.","abstract":"Sonography is the ideal modality for evaluation and characterization of a scrotal mass. Extratesticular masses are usually benign, whereas intratesticular masses are generally malignant until proved otherwise. However, it is important to recognize the benign intratesticular conditions, thus possibly preventing orchiectomy when unwarranted, while appreciating the more significant findings of extratesticular masses that may warrant further intervention. This article reviews the anatomy and sonographic findings of scrotal masses. Normal anatomy, general imaging techniques, and assessment of intratesticular and extratesticular disorders will be discussed.
