{"id":61744,"title":"11C-acetate PET/CT for metabolic characterization of multiple myeloma: a comparative study with 18F-FDG PET/CT.","abstract":"We prospectively compared (11)C-acetate with (18)F-FDG in a PET/CT evaluation of multiple myeloma (MM), specifically on diagnostic accuracy, identification of high-risk patients, and monitoring of treatment response.Dual-tracer PET/CT was performed on 35 pathologically and clinically confirmed and untreated patients (26 with symptomatic MM, 5 with smoldering MM, and 4 with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance) and 20 individuals with normal marrow.(11)C-acetate showed significant incremental value over (18)F-FDG (84.6% vs. 57.7%) for positively identifying patients with diffuse and focal symptomatic MM, and was negative in patients with indolent smoldering MM and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Three functional parameters-number of (11)C-acetate-avid and (18)F-FDG-avid focal bone lesions and (11)C-acetate general marrow activity-strongly correlated with ?-2-microglobulin as surrogate imaging markers of tumor burden. After induction chemotherapy, the metabolic change in (11)C-acetate general marrow activity correlated with clinical response.Metabolic characterization of MM in diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment monitoring can be done more accurately by assessing lipid metabolism with (11)C-acetate than by assessing glucose metabolism with (18)F-FDG.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676754","annotations":[{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Monoclonal antibodies","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Lipid","weight":0.744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Bone marrow","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"},{"name":"Multiple myeloma","weight":0.725046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.703282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.662319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.646259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.619792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.591594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.371555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.354042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Carbohydrate metabolism","weight":0.136102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_metabolism"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.122064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Lipid metabolism","weight":0.0662506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_metabolism"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Monoclonal gammopathy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_gammopathy"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Surrogate endpoint","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_endpoint"},{"name":"Military Medal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Medal"},{"name":"Forensic identification","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification"},{"name":"Smoulder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoulder"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Gamma globulin","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_globulin"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Comparative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative"},{"name":"Inductive reasoning","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0130192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
