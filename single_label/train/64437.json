{"id":64437,"title":"Identifying the causes of contact dermatitis.","abstract":"Contact dermatitis results from skin contact with an exogenous substance. It can be caused by direct contact, airborne particles, vapours or light. Individuals of any age can be affected. The two most common variants are irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). ICD is more common and has a worse prognosis. Other less common forms of contact dermatitis include photocontact allergy and, in food handlers, protein contact dermatitis. ICD is a form of eczema and is induced by direct inflammatory pathways without prior sensitisation. Classical ACD is mediated by type 4 cell-mediated immunity. Sensitisation occurs within 5 to 16 days of skin contact with a potential allergen but at this first exposure there is no inflammation. Frequent exposure and high concentrations of potential allergens increase the risk of sensitisation. If eczema is recurrent/persistent, or occurs in an individual with no previous history of eczema, contact dermatitis should be considered. Dorsal aspects of the hands are most often affected by ICD, usually with involvement of the finger webs. Cumulative effects of water, soaps and detergents are the most common cause of ICD which affects the hands more often than any other site. Nickel, fragrances, rubber accelerators and biocides are the most common sensitisers in ACD. Patients with leg ulcers and stasis eczema are at especially high risk of developing allergies to ingredients of their topical treatments, dressings and bandages. If ACD is suspected the patient should be referred to secondary care for patch testing. Age should not be a deterrent to patch testing. Accurate diagnosis, avoidance of identified allergens and protection from irritants are the key to successful treatment.","date":"2014-08-08","categories":"Immune System
