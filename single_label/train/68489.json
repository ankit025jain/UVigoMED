{"id":68489,"title":"Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy in conditions of renal ischaemia/reperfusion.","abstract":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a worldwide public health issue of increasing incidence, with a significant morbi-mortality. AKI treatment mostly relies on supportive manoeuvres in the absence of specific target-oriented therapy. The pathophysiology of AKI commonly involves ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) events, which cause both immune and metabolic consequences in renal tissue. Similarly, at the time of kidney transplantation (KT), I/R is an unavoidable event which contributes to early graft dysfunction and enhanced graft immunogenicity. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a heterogeneous population of adult, fibroblast-like multi-potent cells characterized by their ability to differentiate into tissues of mesodermal lineages. Because MSC have demonstrated immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and tissue repair properties, MSC administration at the time of I/R and/or at later times has been hypothesized to attenuate AKI severity and to accelerate the regeneration process. Furthermore, MSC in KT could help prevent both I/R injury and acute rejection, thereby increasing graft function and survival. In this review, summarizing the encouraging observations in animal models and in pilot clinical trials, we outline the benefit of MSC therapy in AKI and KT, and envisage their putative role in renal ischaemic conditioning.
