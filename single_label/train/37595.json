{"id":37595,"title":"Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, scimitar syndrome, and aortic coarctation.","abstract":"Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) represents one of the most common causes of myocardial ischemia in infants and if left untreated results in a high mortality rate. When ALCAPA coexists with other congenital malformations, particularly those associated with pulmonary hypertension, the initial presentation can be quite confusing and is often misinterpreted. We report an infant with ALCAPA associated with scimitar syndrome and aortic coarctation whose clinical course illustrates the complexities and difficulties of management with a successful outcome.
