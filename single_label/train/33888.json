{"id":33888,"title":"Aberrant right coronary artery arising from the left sinus of Valsalva with an interarterial course.","abstract":"An anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva with an interarterial course is a rather rare congenital anomaly. Treatment strategies are determined by the risk of sudden cardiac death and the presence of cardiac ischaemia. We present two cases of middle-aged patients who were diagnosed with an interarterial course of a right coronary artery originating from the opposite sinus of Valsalva. As no cardiac ischaemia could be documented these patients were treated medically with excellent long-term follow-up.","date":"2014-05-01","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24783470","annotations":[{"name":"Right coronary artery","weight":0.843406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_coronary_artery"},{"name":"Sudden cardiac death","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_cardiac_death"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.746593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.693139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.672208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Aortic sinus","weight":0.516083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_sinus"},{"name":"Valsalva maneuver","weight":0.274836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Paranasal sinuses","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses"}]}
