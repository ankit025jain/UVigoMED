{"id":56567,"title":"Nanoceria and thioredoxin regulate a common antioxidative gene network in tubby mice.","abstract":"Oxidative stress is a node common to the causes and effects of various ocular diseases. We have shown that thioredoxin has neuroprotective effects on tubby photoreceptors. We also demonstrated that nanoceria (cerium oxide nanoparticles), which are direct antioxidants, have long-term effects on prevention of retinal degeneration in tubby mice. Here, using commercially available PCR array plates, we surveyed the regulation in expression of 89 oxidative stress-associated genes in the eyes of P12 tubby mice which are either intravitreally injected with nanoceria or in which the Trx gene is overexpressed. Our data demonstrate that nanoceria and Trx regulate the same group of genes associated with antioxidative stress and antioxidant defense.
