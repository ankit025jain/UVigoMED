{"id":62726,"title":"Improved treatment results of children with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a report from the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group B-NHL03 study.","abstract":"Previous Japanese studies of childhood B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) have shown a favorable outcome, though the study size was too small to effectively assess the efficacy and safety of treatment for childhood B-NHL.We performed a nation-wide prospective B-NHL03 study to assess the efficacy and safety of short-pulse intensive chemotherapy for children with B-NHL. They were stratified into four treatment groups according to disease stage, tumor resectability and bone marrow/CNS involvement: Group 1 with all resected stage I/II, Group 2 with non-resected stage I/II, Group 3 with stage III & CNS-negative stage IV, and Group 4 with CNS-positive stage IV & Burkitt leukemia. Treatment duration was 2 courses for Group 1, 4 courses for Group 2, and 6 courses for Groups 3 and 4, respectively. CNS irradiation was omitted in all patients.The follow-up time ranged from 0.8 to 88 months, with a median of being 45 months. For 321 patients analyzed in this study, overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 92.7% and 87.4%, respectively. The 4-year EFS according to treatment group were 94% for Group 1 (n = 17), 98% for Group 2 (n = 103), 84% for Group 3 (n = 111), and 78% for Group 4 (n = 90). There was no significant difference in outcome by histology. Therapy-related death occurred in three patients in remission.Our nationwide large-scale study resulted in a cure rate above 90% with <1% toxic death in childhood B-NHL.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523211","annotations":[{"name":"Histology","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.822747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.812446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.73884,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.699138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.639348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.615987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.601239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.576323,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.566594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.530919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.409679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.368031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.244994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.23589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.13575,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Conditions races","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_races"},{"name":"Encrypting File System","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypting_File_System"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Francis Crawford Burkitt","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crawford_Burkitt"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Study Group International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_Group_International"},{"name":"Japanese studies","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_studies"}]}
