{"id":56395,"title":"Therapeutic effects of 0.1% tacrolimus eye drops for refractory allergic ocular diseases with proliferative lesion or corneal involvement.","abstract":"The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of topical 0.1% tacrolimus in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement.This prospective observational study included 1436 patients with refractory allergic conjunctivitis whose condition had responded poorly to conventional antiallergic drugs and/or topical steroids and/or topical cyclosporine. All patients received tacrolimus eye drops twice daily during the study period. Ten clinical signs and six clinical symptoms were rated on a four-grade scale. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total clinical signs and symptoms score at the last observation or following 6?months of treatment.Total signs and symptoms score significantly decreased after 1?month of treatment (p<0.001). Giant papillae and corneal lesions were also reduced by tacrolimus eye drop use (p<0.001). The drug proved effective in patients whose condition did not respond well to topical cyclosporine therapy. About 50% of all patients using topical steroids were weaned. The most common adverse reaction was a transient burning sensation (3.20%).Tacrolimus eye drops are highly effective in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement, and may reduce or replace topical steroid use.UMIN 000008640.","date":"2014-07-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695688","annotations":[{"name":"Eye drop","weight":0.933031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_drop"},{"name":"Ciclosporin","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin"},{"name":"Conjunctivitis","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.805314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.772178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Tacrolimus","weight":0.730976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacrolimus"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Topical","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.726259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Steroid","weight":0.71056,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.650676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.527633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.412202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Topical steroid","weight":0.337038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_steroid"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.294258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Allergic conjunctivitis","weight":0.158474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Anabolic steroid","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Weaning","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"},{"name":"Combustion","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Hair follicle","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"}]}
