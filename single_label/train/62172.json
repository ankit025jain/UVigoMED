{"id":62172,"title":"Preoperative anemia impacts early postoperative recovery following autologous breast reconstruction.","abstract":"Preoperative anemia impacts a significant portion of breast reconstruction patients, though this does not appear to affect surgical outcomes. The impact of anemia on postoperative physical and mental health, however, is unknown. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the role of preoperative anemia in recovery after autologous reconstruction.From 2005 to 2010, we prospectively assessed autologous breast reconstruction patients with satisfaction surveys, strength and functional tests, and the short form 36 (SF36). Data was collected preoperatively and at early (<90d), intermediate (90-365d), and late (>365d) follow-up. We stratified patients by presence or lack of preoperative anemia (hemoglobin<12 g/dL).Of 399 patients undergoing reconstruction, 179 enrolled in the study. Anemic patients (n = 31, 17%) had higher rates of preoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.02) and lower rates of radiation (p = 0.001). Preoperatively, anemic patients reported worse physical (p < 0.001), mental (p = 0.003) and overall health (p = 0.0003). These scores worsened postoperatively for anemic and nonanemic patients, though anemic patients had lower average scores in all SF36 categories. This was significant only for early follow-up physical health (p = 0.02). Change in SF36 scores and objective physical exam assessments did not differ between the two cohorts.Though preoperative anemia may not impact surgical outcomes, it adversely impacts the recovery of breast reconstruction patients. Subjective physical health differences were significant in early follow-up, though this did not translate to differences in mental health or satisfaction. We advocate for preoperative optimization of hemoglobin to enhance the early recovery potential of breast reconstruction patients.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613772","annotations":[{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.722888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.712178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.705736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.610939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.546519,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.289795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.278403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.253699,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.0611723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Breast reconstruction","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_reconstruction"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0246094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"399","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/399"},{"name":"2005","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Functional testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Advocate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate"},{"name":"Middle school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Objectivity (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)"}]}
