{"id":8170,"title":"Lack of cross-sensitization between ?-1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout porcine and allogeneic skin grafts permits serial grafting.","abstract":"The current standard of care for burns requiring operative treatment consists of early burn excision and autologous split-thickness skin grafting. However, in large burns, sufficient donor sites may not be available to achieve total coverage, necessitating temporary coverage with allogeneic human cadaver skin grafts or synthetic skin substitutes. A previous study from this laboratory demonstrated that skin grafts from alpha-1,3 galactosyltransferase knockout (GalT-KO) miniature swine enjoyed survival comparable to that of allogeneic skin grafts in baboons.In the present study, we have evaluated the immune response against sequential GalT-KO and allogeneic skin grafts to determine whether such serial grafts could extend the period of temporary wound coverage before definitive grafting with autologous skin.We report that rejection of primary GalT-KO skin grafts led to an anti-xenogeneic humoral response with no evidence for sensitization to alloantigens nor acceleration of rejection of allogeneic skin grafts. Similarly, presensitization with allogeneic skin did not lead to accelerated rejection of xenogeneic skin.These data suggest that GalT-KO skin grafts could provide an early first-line treatment in the management of severe burns that would not preclude subsequent use of allografts, and that serial grafting of GalT-KO skin and allogeneic skin could potentially be used to provide an extended period of temporary burn wound coverage.","date":"2014-06-17","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24798308","annotations":[{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.815743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.795487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.751095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.723855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Skin grafting","weight":0.716594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_grafting"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.659469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.57582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.556912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.537872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.34967,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Artificial skin","weight":0.263725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_skin"},{"name":"Humoral immunity","weight":0.258843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.168093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Baboon","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baboon"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Ossabaw Island Hog","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossabaw_Island_Hog"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.0256641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Knockout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout"},{"name":"Sequence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence"},{"name":"Blood donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation"},{"name":"Substitute (association football)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)"},{"name":"Intermittent energy source","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_energy_source"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Alpha (ethology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(ethology)"},{"name":"Galactosyltransferase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactosyltransferase"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
