{"id":80678,"title":"Leishmania braziliensis amastigotes stimulate production of IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-? by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from nonendemic area healthy residents.","abstract":"Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis causes cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis in several countries in Latin America. In mammals, the parasites live as amastigotes, interacting with host immune cells and stimulating cytokine production that will drive the type of the specific immune responses. Generation of Th17 lymphocytes is associated with tissue destruction and depends on IL-1?, IL-6, TGF-? and IL-23 production, whereas IL-10 and TGF-? are associated with tissue protection. Here, we evaluate whether amastigotes stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors to produce the major cytokines responsible for the generation of Th17. Seven L. (V.) braziliensis isolates from patients with different clinical forms of leishmaniasis were expanded in interferon-? knockout mice to obtain amastigotes and in culture to get promastigotes. The parasites were used to stimulate PBMCs from healthy donors, and cytokine production was evaluated by ELISA or qPCR. Amastigotes and promastigotes induced IL-10 production in PBMCs; however, only amastigotes induced IL-1?, IL-6 and TGF-?. These data demonstrate for the first time that L. (V.) braziliensis amastigotes directly stimulate production of a unique pattern of cytokines that could contribute to the generation of Th17.
