{"id":90803,"title":"Adverse prognostic factors and optimal intervention time for kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty in osteoporotic fractures.","abstract":"While evidence supports the efficacy of vertebral augmentation (kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty) for the treatment of osteoporotic fractures, randomized trials disputed the value of vertebroplasty. The aim of this analysis is to determine the subset of patients that may not benefit from surgical intervention and find the optimal intervention time.27 prospective multiple-arm studies with cohorts of more than 20 patients were included in this meta-analysis. We hereby report the results from the metaregression and subset analysis of those trials reporting on treatment of osteoporotic fractures with kyphoplasty and/or vertebroplasty.Early intervention (first 7 weeks after fracture) yielded more pain relief. However, spontaneous recovery was encountered in hyperacute fractures (less than 2 weeks old). Patients suffering from thoracic fractures or severely deformed vertebrae tended to report inferior results. We also attempted to formulate a treatment algorithm.Intervention in the hyperacute period should not be pursued, while augmentation after 7 weeks yields less consistent results. In cases of thoracic fractures and significant vertebral collapse, surgeons or interventional radiologists may resort earlier to operation and be less conservative, although those parameters need to be addressed in future randomized trials.","date":"2014-02-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575417","annotations":[{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.815885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.815845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.733152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.654259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.649771,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Pain management","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.434085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Interventional radiology","weight":0.388645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventional_radiology"},{"name":"Algorithm","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.181281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.143256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous_vertebroplasty"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Operation Barbarossa","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Resort","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Liberal Christianity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Early childhood intervention","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_intervention"},{"name":"Yield (wine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(wine)"},{"name":"Augmentation (psychiatry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentation_(psychiatry)"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Adverse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse"},{"name":"Spontaneous recovery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_recovery"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
