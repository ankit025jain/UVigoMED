{"id":11640,"title":"[Open construction of experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm swine models with Dacron patch for evaluating endovascular aneurysm repair techniques].","abstract":"To construct an experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) swine model with Dacron patch for evaluating endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) technique.The experimental pigs were generally anesthetized for the open procedure of an aneurysm model creation with Dacron and subsequent arteriography and EVAR with stent graft. Repeat arteriography was performed after 3-month follow-up.AAA models were successfully constructed in all 10 experimental pigs. The average aneurysm diameter was (26.3±3.1)mm, increasing by (15.7±3.1)mm comparing to the primary aorta diameter (10.5±0.4)mm. The aorta diameter before and after the experiment showed significant difference (P<0.001). All the animals were survived after the procedure. One swine died 24 hours after the subsequent EVAR because the covering of both renal arteries by the stent graft. The rest 9 animals survived well after the whole operation and 3-month follow-up. The surviving rates at 1 month and 3 months after the operation were both 90%. One type 2 endoleak (10%) was observed after the EVAR, which disappeared at 3-month follow-up.Open construction of experimental AAA swine models with Dacron patch is safe and feasible. The model can be used in the developing new EVAR techniques and implant training.","date":"2014-03-03","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581136","annotations":[{"name":"Stent","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Polyethylene terephthalate","weight":0.850122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate"},{"name":"Aortic aneurysm","weight":0.829848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Aorta","weight":0.826004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta"},{"name":"Renal artery","weight":0.814942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_artery"},{"name":"Aneurysm","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.787492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.685964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Endovascular aneurysm repair","weight":0.6532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_aneurysm_repair"},{"name":"Abdominal aortic aneurysm","weight":0.636798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.404307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0546925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.0221911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Patch (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Opera 10","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_10"},{"name":"Prosthesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Tetragonal crystal system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonal_crystal_system"},{"name":"Forced disappearance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance"}]}
