{"id":80463,"title":"[Identification of new epidemiological scenarios for Chagas disease in the Momposina region, North of Colombia].","abstract":"The Momposina region is one of the most interesting areas to study new epidemiological scenarios for Chagas disease in Colombia.To determine the presence of a source of peridomestic transmission of T. cruzi and its epidemiological risk in the Momposina region, based on the bimodal weather pattern characteristic of Colombia.Four surveys over two years (two in the rainy season and two during the dry one) were conducted. Triatomines feces and blood samples from human and reservoirs were evaluated for presence of antibodies and parasites by ELISA, IFI and PCR. The conditions of housing, feeding triatomine state and involvement of dogs in the transmission were assessed.High rates of infection with T. cruzi in insects and wild animals were found. Infection rates of T. cruzi in dogs (15%) and humans (16.8%) were found. The results obtained in this study indicated that in the dry season there is increased risk of infection with T. cruzi , given the higher population density of insects, the higher percentage of fed insects and the higher rate of infection.These results confirm the presence and movement of a peridomestic outbreak of T. cruzi and describes some risk factors for the eco-epidemiological area, suggesting new epidemiological scenarios for Chagas disease in Colombia.","date":"2014-03-21","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652208","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.912942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Feces","weight":0.790758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.783697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.760896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Chagas disease","weight":0.629059,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease"},{"name":"Insect","weight":0.601264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.502129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.475271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Colombia","weight":0.422041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"},{"name":"Wildlife","weight":0.414275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife"},{"name":"Population density","weight":0.355845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density"},{"name":"Triatominae","weight":0.234872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triatominae"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Trypanosoma cruzi","weight":0.147825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_cruzi"},{"name":"Wet season","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season"},{"name":"Dry season","weight":0.125095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.110212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"North America","weight":0.0603772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"},{"name":"Venipuncture","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"House","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Season","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Weather","weight":0.0134898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather"}]}
