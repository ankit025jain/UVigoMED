{"id":20733,"title":"The response of a local health authority to reported cases of salmonellosis in a Portuguese municipality, 2007 to 2011.","abstract":"Human salmonelloses are statutorily reportable infectious diseases (SRID) in Portugal. Data derived from SRID surveillance systems have been used in international comparisons as well as in studies assessing the sources and modes of transmission of Salmonella infections in humans.We evaluated a salmonellosis (statutorily reportable) surveillance system in a Portuguese local health authority, consulting routine data available. The main objectives were describing procedures used to investigate and respond to reported cases, and identifying the sources of infection and modes of transmission.In the five year period from 2007 to 2011, medical doctors reported 58 cases of non-typhoidal salmonellosis to the local health authority. Fifty four reported cases were in hospitalized children (age range 1-19 years) and 44 were associated with drinking water from private wells or eating raw egg products, which is consistent with other studies.This local surveillance system was useful for detecting both isolated cases and outbreaks of salmonellosis and for identifying modes of transmission and sources of infection. It stimulated community health educational activities to prevent future cases. However, further evaluation including economic analysis and an impact assessment is required at both local and national levels.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642182","annotations":[{"name":"Infectious disease","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Portugal","weight":0.765384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.730357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.721851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Physician","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.654651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.561374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Health care","weight":0.558217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.510939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.441392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"International","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International"},{"name":"Egg (food)","weight":0.355874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)"},{"name":"Authority","weight":0.310873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.218291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Salmonella","weight":0.215173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"},{"name":"Municipality","weight":0.2144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality"},{"name":"Water well","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_well"},{"name":"Economics","weight":0.179976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.159972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.139606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Egg (biology)","weight":0.11684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)"},{"name":"Alcoholic beverage","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Community health","weight":0.0529772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Salmonellosis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonellosis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Amateur radio","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Mountain range","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Mode of transport","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_transport"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Environmental impact assessment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment"}]}
