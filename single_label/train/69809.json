{"id":69809,"title":"Novel characterization of bEnd.3 cells that express lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1.","abstract":"Murine bEnd.3 endothelioma cell line has been widely used in vascular research and here we report the novel finding that bEnd.3 cells express lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3). Moreover, these cells express progenitor cell markers of Sca-1 and CD133. Upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), the bEnd.3 cells demonstrate enhanced formation of capillary-type tubes, which express LYVE-1. As the bEnd.3 cell line is derived from murine endothelioma, we further examined human tissues of endothelioma and identified lymphatic vessels in the tumor samples which express both LYVE-1 and podoplanin. Moreover, a significantly higher number of lymphatic vessels were detected in the endothelioma samples compared with normal control. Taken together, this study not only redefines bEnd.3 cells for vascular research, but also indicates a broader category of human diseases that are associated with lymphatics, such as endothelioma.","date":"2014-10-06","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282873","annotations":[{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Hyaluronan","weight":0.857718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan"},{"name":"Vascular endothelial growth factor","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor"},{"name":"Lymphatic vessel","weight":0.81466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_vessel"},{"name":"Necrosis","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Endothelium","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Lymphoid system","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoid_system"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.542332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.487222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.459367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Murinae","weight":0.422697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murinae"},{"name":"VEGF receptors","weight":0.346332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGF_receptors"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.199121,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Growth factor receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"}]}
