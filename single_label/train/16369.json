{"id":16369,"title":"[Acid stress response of Salmonella and its relationship with virulence--a review].","abstract":"As successful enteric bacteria, Salmonella spp. has to overcome the extreme acid condition in the stomach before invading into host intestinal epithelial cells. Salmonella spp. has evolved an adaptation to its replicative niche in the acidic environment. This review summarizes acid resistant characteristics of Salmonella, and introduces several mechanisms to acid resistance, including keeping internal pH homeostatic, synthesizing acid shock protein through several regulatory pathways and altering membrane character. The achievements will be significant for understanding and controlling Salmonella infections in the future.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25007648","annotations":[{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Homeostasis","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis"},{"name":"Gut flora","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Salmonella","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella"},{"name":"Ecological niche","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.761555,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.719453,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Intestine","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.672016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"DNA replication","weight":0.629769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Shock (circulatory)","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.312859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Character (arts)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)"},{"name":"Intestinal epithelium","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_epithelium"}]}
