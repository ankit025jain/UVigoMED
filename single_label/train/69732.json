{"id":69732,"title":"20-year experience with intraoperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy for pediatric sarcoma: outcomes, toxicity, and practice recommendations.","abstract":"To assess outcomes and toxicity of high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy (HDR-IORT) in the management of pediatric sarcoma.Seventy-five pediatric patients underwent HDR-IORT for sarcoma from May 1993 to November 2013. The median age was 9 years old (36 patients were ? 6 years old). HDR-IORT was part of initial therapy in 37 patients (49%) and for recurrent disease in 38 patients (51%). Forty-one patients (55%) received HDR-IORT and postoperative external beam RT (PORT), and 22 patients (29%) were previously treated with external beam radiation therapy to the IORT site. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.At a median follow-up of 7.8 years for surviving patients, 5-year projected rates of LC, EFS, and OS were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50%-76%), 33% (95% CI 21%-45%), and 43% (95% CI 30%-55%), with a median survival of 3.1 years. The 5-year LC, EFS, and OS rates for patients with recurrent disease were 46% (95% CI, 28%-64%), 30% (95% CI, 13%-46%), and 36% (95% CI, 18%-54%). Acute toxicity ? grade 3 occurred in 2 (2.5%) treatments; late toxicity ? grade 3 occurred in 4 (5.3%) patients 0.3-9.9 years after HDR-IORT. The incidence of toxicity ? grade 3 was not associated with HDR-IORT applicator size, HDR-IORT dose, prior RT or PORT, or prior or postoperative chemotherapy, but all toxicity ? grade 3 occurred in patients ? 6 years treated with HDR-IORT doses ? 12 Gy.HDR-IORT is a well-tolerated component of multimodality therapy for pediatric sarcoma, allowing additional local treatment while reducing external beam exposure. Taking clinical considerations into account, doses between 8-12 Gy are appropriate for HDR-IORT in patients ? 6 years of age.","date":"2014-10-11","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25304795","annotations":[{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"External beam radiotherapy","weight":0.801885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.784197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Intraoperative radiation therapy","weight":0.770417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraoperative_radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.672072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.536023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.507711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.387952,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.366938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.268332,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Bimodal distribution","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.146624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.0916205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Encrypting File System","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypting_File_System"},{"name":"1854","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854"},{"name":"812","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/812"},{"name":"1346","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1346"},{"name":"2013","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013"},{"name":"DNA polymerase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_polymerase"},{"name":"Orion (spacecraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)"},{"name":"Brush","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush"},{"name":"Beam (nautical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_(nautical)"},{"name":"2140s","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2140s"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Acute toxicity","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_toxicity"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
