{"id":20291,"title":"Species distribution and antifungal susceptibility profile of Candida isolates from bloodstream infections in Lima, Peru.","abstract":"Yeast identification and in vitro susceptibility testing provide helpful information for appropriate administration of antifungal treatments; however, few reports from the Latin American region have been published. The aim of this study was to identify the species present in isolates from bloodstream infections diagnosed in nine hospitals in Lima, Peru and to determine their in vitro susceptibility to four antifungal drugs. We tested and identified 153 isolates collected between October 2009 and August 2011 using standard methods. PCR and PCR-RFLP assays were performed to distinguish Candida albicans from Candida dubliniensis and to identify species of the Candida parapsilosis and Candida glabrata complexes. Antifungal susceptibility testing for fluconazole, anidulafungin and voriconazole was performed using the CSLI M27-A3 method, and amphotericin B susceptibility was determined using the Etest method. The most frequently isolated species were: C. albicans (61; 39.9?%), C. parapsilosis (43; 28.1?%), C. tropicalis (36; 23.5%) and C. glabrata (8; 5.2?%). The overall susceptibility rates were 98.0?%, 98.7?%, 98.0?% and 97.4?% for amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole and anidulafungin, respectively. No isolate was resistant to more than one drug. These results showed that the rate of resistance to four antifungal drugs was low among Candida bloodstream isolates in Lima, Peru.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667770","annotations":[{"name":"Voriconazole","weight":0.914023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voriconazole"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Amphotericin B","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphotericin_B"},{"name":"Fluconazole","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluconazole"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.850131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Antifungal medication","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal_medication"},{"name":"Anidulafungin","weight":0.793903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anidulafungin"},{"name":"Candida glabrata","weight":0.761326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_glabrata"},{"name":"Yeast","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.744811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.609038,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.45922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Peru","weight":0.44911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru"},{"name":"Candida tropicalis","weight":0.371636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_tropicalis"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.229465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Latin","weight":0.140165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Latin America","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Lima","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"}]}
