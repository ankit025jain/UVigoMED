{"id":73604,"title":"Advances in therapy for pediatric sarcomas.","abstract":"Pediatric sarcomas are relatively rare malignancies individually. As a group they are typically approached with combination chemotherapies in addition to local control. Fortunately, these malignancies have been approached through careful clinical trial collaboration to define risk groups and appropriately deliver local control measures and systemic therapies. Although local disease is typically approached with curative intent, therapy typically lasts over 6 months and has significant associated morbidities. It is more difficult to cure metastatic disease or induce sustained remissions. In this article, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of the disease process and highlight recent and future cooperative group trials in osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas, and desmoid tumor as well as discuss promising therapeutic approaches such as epigenetics and immunotherapy.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894064","annotations":[{"name":"Rhabdomyosarcoma","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyosarcoma"},{"name":"Osteosarcoma","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma"},{"name":"Epigenetics","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.811154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunotherapy","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Sarcoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoma"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.714391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.695466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Soft-tissue sarcoma","weight":0.487247,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft-tissue_sarcoma"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.486317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Ewing's sarcoma","weight":0.459674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewing's_sarcoma"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.438221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Aggressive fibromatosis","weight":0.0805556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggressive_fibromatosis"},{"name":"Curative care","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curative_care"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Cooperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative"}]}
