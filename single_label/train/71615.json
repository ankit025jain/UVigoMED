{"id":71615,"title":"[Effect of intermediate-dose cytarabine on mobilization of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell in acute myeloid leukemia].","abstract":"To explore the impact of courses of intermediate-dose cytarabine (ID-Ara-C) chemotherapy on the efficiency of hematopoietic stem cell mobilization in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT).90 patients with de novo AML undergoing auto-HSCT between August 1999 and November 2012 were enrolled. All patients received the mobilization regimen of cytarabine and etoposide chemotherapy in combination with recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). Stem cell apheresis was scheduled when blood leukocyte count recovered greater than 4.0 × 10?/L or the proportion of CD34? cells greater than 1% in peripheral blood. The impact of ID-Ara-C courses on the mobilization efficiency was analyzed retrospectively.According to the ID-Ara-C courses, patients were divided into group A (<2 courses), B (2 courses), and C (>2 courses). The median doses of CD34? cells (×10?/kg) in three groups were 4.7, 2.7, 2.3, respectively (P=0.003). Of the available 87 patients who could be evaluated, 61 (70.1%) cases had CD34? cells greater than 2.0 × 10?/kg, and 26 (29.9%) cases less than 2.0 × 10?/kg. Of the 26 patients without satisfactory mobilization efficiency, 7 (15.2%) were in group A, 10 (47.6%) in group B, and 9 (45.0%) in group C (?²=10.05, P=0.007). In addition, patients with satisfactory mobilization efficiency (CD34? cells ? 2.0×10?/kg) in groups C needed more times of collection, more volume of blood processed, and even high-dose and longer course of rhG-CSF (P<0.05). In univariate analysis. The ID-Ara-C courses and the cumulative dose were significant correlate with mobilization efficiency. In multivariate analysis, the ID-Ara-C courses was an independent correlation factor for mobilization efficiency (odd ratio=0.623, 95% confidence interval=0.418-0.926, P=0.019). The sex, age, cytogenetic risk, the standard chemotherapy courses did not correlate with mobilization efficiency.The number of ID-Ara-C courses was independent factor for the mobilization efficiency and should be taken seriously in AML patients with auto-HSCT.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25052597","annotations":[{"name":"CD34","weight":0.918371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34"},{"name":"Etoposide","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoposide"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"},{"name":"Apheresis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apheresis"},{"name":"Cytarabine","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.833403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Recombinant DNA","weight":0.832197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Haematopoiesis","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematopoiesis"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.742406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Cumulative dose","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_dose"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.569283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.486164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.447966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.377288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.301978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0935195,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Blood volume","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Sexual intercourse","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}]}
