{"id":46998,"title":"Pet veterinarians have no increased risk of hepatitis E compared to the general population.","abstract":"The discovery of autochthonous hepatitis E in industrialized countries associated to genotype 3 has changed substantially the understanding about hepatitis E virus (HEV) circulation. In these countries transmission has been associated to the consumption and direct contact to swine, a well-known reservoir for HEV. More animal reservoirs for HEV might exist since antibodies to HEV have been detected in other animal species, such as dogs and cats. Given the intimate contact between these pets and humans, the potential zoonotic HEV transmission from dogs and cats deserves to be explored. To address this issue, 493 sera from pet veterinarians (373) and matched general population (120) were tested for the presence of anti-HEV IgG using a commercial ELISA. Antibodies to HEV were found in 9.9% veterinarians and 13.3% general population. No statistically significant difference was found between these two groups showing that pet veterinarians have no increased risk to hepatitis E compared to the general population.","date":"2014-04-07","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610550","annotations":[{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Zoonosis","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.811916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Animal","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin G","weight":0.746411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.724116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Cat","weight":0.713367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Developed country","weight":0.702601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Dog","weight":0.657269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"},{"name":"Pet","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.603496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.58102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Veterinarian","weight":0.541137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.470748,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Hepatitis E","weight":0.388223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_E"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.382208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.352256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.295809,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.165475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Indigenous peoples","weight":0.119326,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples"},{"name":"Reservoir","weight":0.112349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Industrialisation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0340852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Advertising","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"}]}
