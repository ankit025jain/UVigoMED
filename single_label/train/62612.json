{"id":62612,"title":"An 8-month-old girl with an enlarging lesion on her face. Juvenile xanthogranuloma.","abstract":"An otherwise healthy 8-month-old girl presented to the pediatric dermatology clinic for evaluation of an enlarging lesion on her right cheek. The child's mother first noticed this \"bump\" a month prior to presentation and denied any inciting event. The lesion had increased in size since it was first noted but was not symptomatic. No bleeding was noted. Perinatal history and review of systems were unremarkable. On physical examination, a solitary, well-demarcated, 3-mm yellow erythematous papule with central erosion was noted on the right upper cheek. No other lesions were identified. Lymph node examination was unremarkable. Clinical observation was recommended, with excision if significant enlargement or atypical features developed. Two months later, the lesion remained asymptomatic but had grown to 9 mm in size. The central erosion persisted, but no bleeding occurred.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24549084","annotations":[{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.782659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.720457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.580881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.403354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.37582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.354696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Papule","weight":0.335458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papule"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.280374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.272429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Asymptomatic","weight":0.240437,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Maxilla","weight":0.0649317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"},{"name":"Erythema","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Human body","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body"},{"name":"Juvenile xanthogranuloma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_xanthogranuloma"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Yellow","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Juvenile (rapper)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_(rapper)"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"}]}
