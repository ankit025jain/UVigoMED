{"id":24599,"title":"Clinical and epidemiological assessment concerning hybrid revascularization techniques in the treatment of multilevel arterial occlusive disease.","abstract":"Aim of the study was to report a novel hybrid technique for multilevel arterial lesions of the lower extremities and to evaluate the clinical outcomes. In patients with multilevel arterial disease, the combined (hybrid) treatment, consisting of endovascular intervention and classical surgical intervention on the same vascular axis seems to be the most indicated treatment in order to obtain an adequate inflow and outflow.We have performed a non-randomized study during a 44-month period (January 2010 - September 2013) in a number of 94 patients treated by hybrid revascularization techniques. All the patients included in the study have been post-surgically surveyed at well established intervals (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 36 months) by: clinical examination, laboratory tests, Duplex ultrasound, and, as needed, CT or MR Angiography.The 6 months primary patency in each studied group (corresponding to the years of 2010, 2011 and 2012) was 58.69%, 68.42%, and 62.06%, respectively; the 12 months primary patency was 45.65%, 57.89%, and 34.48%, respectively. Clinical improvement has been noticed in 83 patients (88.29%). There have been registered 19 amputations (20.21% of the cases): 11 majors (thigh and below the knee), representing 11.7% of the total number of cases and 8 minors (toe or transmetatarsal), representing 8.51% of the total number of cases. The amputation-free survival period ranged between 7 days and 24 months, with an average of 7.66 months.The hybrid techniques are a feasible option for the multilevel arterial disease, with favorable patency and limb salvage rates.","date":"2014-10-24","categories":"Cardiovascular
