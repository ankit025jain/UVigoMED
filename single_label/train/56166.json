{"id":56166,"title":"Bloody tears and recurrent nasolacrimal duct obstruction due to a retained silicone stent.","abstract":"A 6-year-old girl with a history of bilateral nasolacrimal duct obstruction presented with recurrent tearing, discharge, and bloody tears from the right eye. The patient had a history of multiple prior probing and stenting procedures on the right nasolacrimal system. Endoscopic dacryocystorhinotomy revealed a retained portion of a prior stent and accompanying pyogenic granuloma, removal of which resolved her symptoms.
