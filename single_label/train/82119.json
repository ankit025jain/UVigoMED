{"id":82119,"title":"Revascularization of immature non-vital permanent teeth--literature review and a case study.","abstract":"Apical periodontitis in permanent children's teeth with incomplete root development is a challenge for endodontists to treat. It is important that highly efficient therapeutic methods and biologically valuable therapies be developed to prevent the loss of these teeth. The AIM of the study was to review modern literature on revascularization of non-vital permanent teeth with incomplete root development, and to present a clinical case. The literature review herein reflects the modern concept of revascularization of non-vital permanent teeth with incomplete root development. Clinical protocols are presented on cases with and without the formation of a blood clot. The case study reports the treatment of an immature non-vital permanent tooth using the technique of revascularization that utilises formation of a blood clot and use of a two-component antibiotic paste for disinfection. One year after treatment the clinical and radiological data showed absence of subjective complaints, thickening of the root walls, apical closure and no periapical pathology of the revascularized tooth. Literature data and the favorable outcome of our case allow us to further research the revascularization of immature non-vital permanent teeth.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24712277","annotations":[{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.804728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.758091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.577565,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Tooth","weight":0.56297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.531202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Disinfectant","weight":0.259241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.254458,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Endodontics","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endodontics"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.132246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Concept","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Clinical trial protocol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial_protocol"},{"name":"Permanent teeth","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_teeth"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Modernism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Thickening agent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thickening_agent"}]}
