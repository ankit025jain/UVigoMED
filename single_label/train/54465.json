{"id":54465,"title":"Disparate effects of pharmacotherapy on plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome.","abstract":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by obesity and insulin resistance (IR), which result in elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels. We aimed to assess the changes in PAI-1 levels in PCOS during treatment with metformin and during weight loss.Twenty-three normal weight women with PCOS were given metformin 850 mg bid for 6 months. Fifty overweight/obese women with PCOS were prescribed an energy-restricted diet, were instructed to exercise and were randomized to orlistat 120 mg tid or sibutramine 10 mg qd for 6 months.In normal weight women, treatment with metformin reduced the body mass index (BMI) and circulating androgens, improved markers of IR and lowered PAI-1 levels. In overweight/obese women, sibutramine and orlistat yielded comparable reductions in BMI and markers of IR. In contrast, the effects on the free androgen index (FAI) differed (p=0.027): sibutramine reduced the FAI (p=0.005), whereas orlistat had no effect. The effects of sibutramine and orlistat on PAI-1 levels also differed (p=0.042): sibutramine reduced PAI-1 levels (p<0.001), whereas orlistat had no effect.Metformin and sibutramine, but not orlistat, reduce PAI-1 levels in PCOS. The reduction in circulating androgens during metformin and sibutramine treatment might be implicated in this decline.","date":"2014-01-24","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457404","annotations":[{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.92649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Orlistat","weight":0.908084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlistat"},{"name":"Sibutramine","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibutramine"},{"name":"Metformin","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"},{"name":"Insulin resistance","weight":0.881922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.878619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1","weight":0.874764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator_inhibitor-1"},{"name":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","weight":0.839468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Body weight","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.793579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.764833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.725905,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.480937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.401426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.315777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.278866,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.17754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.165635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"}]}
