{"id":80058,"title":"[Enterobius vermicularis infection status among children in 9 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities of China].","abstract":"To investigate the infection status of Enterobius vermicularis among children in 9 Provinces/Autonomous regions/Municipalities (P/A/M) of China, and analyze its risk factors.From April to December 2011, one provincial capital (prefecture-level city) and one county (city, district) were chosen as investigation spots from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui and Guizhou, respectively. Children aged 2 to 12 were examined by using adhesive cellophane anal swab with round-bottom tube. Information of children's family condition, health behavior and school environment were collected by questionnairing.14 964 children were examined, and 14 582 qualified questionnaires were collected. The total prevalence was 17.8% (2 659/14 964). Of the 9 P/A/M, the prevalence was highest in Hainan Province (51.1%, 869/1 701) and lowest in Anhui Province (0.8%, 13/1 589). The prevalence in urban areas (7.3%, 552/7 581) was lower than that of rural areas (28.5%, 2 107/7 383) (chi2 = 1156.73, P < 0.01). The highest prevalence in urban and rural areas was found in Haikou City(38.0%, 322/847) and Wanning City (64.1%, 547/854) of Hainan Province. The prevalence rate in males and females was 17.4% (1 410/8 128) and 18.3% (1249/6 834), respectively (chi2 = 2.192, P > 0.05). The highest prevalence in males (61.2%, 300/490) and females (67.9%, 247/364) was found in children of Wanning City. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that residence, education level of parents, occupation of parents, nail biting, types of classroom ground and type of boarding were the risk factors on E. vermicularis infection.The prevalence of enterobiasis in children is still high in many areas of China, and the prevention and control measures should be taken according to the risk factors.","date":"2014-05-12","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812872","annotations":[{"name":"Anhui","weight":0.891163,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui"},{"name":"Guangdong","weight":0.88878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong"},{"name":"Fujian","weight":0.88878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian"},{"name":"Guizhou","weight":0.88878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizhou"},{"name":"Guangxi","weight":0.887746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi"},{"name":"Zhejiang","weight":0.872268,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang"},{"name":"Chongqing","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing"},{"name":"Hainan","weight":0.865084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan"},{"name":"Sichuan","weight":0.860214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan"},{"name":"China","weight":0.779558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.546869,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Rural area","weight":0.529015,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"},{"name":"Capital city","weight":0.457468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_city"},{"name":"City","weight":0.382633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Haikou","weight":0.3509,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haikou"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.228716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.21971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.160714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.144954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"School","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"County","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Wanning","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanning"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"District (China)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_(China)"},{"name":"London Underground","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground"},{"name":"Nail (fastener)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(fastener)"},{"name":"589","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/589"},{"name":"2011","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Classroom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classroom"},{"name":"Environmental policy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_policy"},{"name":"834","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/834"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Boarding school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school"},{"name":"AIDS","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"},{"name":"Suicide","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide"}]}
