{"id":4999,"title":"Flexor tendon injury, repair and rehabilitation.","abstract":"Injuries to the flexor tendons remain among the most difficult problems in hand surgery. Historically, lacerations to the intrasynovial portion of the flexor tendons were thought to be unsuitable for primary repair. Despite continuing advances in our knowledge of flexor tendon biology, repair, and rehabilitation, good results following primary repair of flexor tendons remain challenging to achieve.
