{"id":76960,"title":"Outcome of minimally invasive hip replacement in obese, overweight, and nonobese patients.","abstract":"The goal of this study was to determine whether obesity affects implant positioning or early functional outcome after minimally invasive total hip replacement. The authors evaluated 119 patients who had undergone minimally invasive total hip replacement via a direct anterior approach. The patients were segregated according to World Health Organization body mass index categories: nonobese, overweight, or obese. Perioperative variables, resulting cup position, and early outcome (Harris Hip Score) were assessed. The only significant difference among the groups was mean operative time (obese > overweight > nonobese). Although the obese group's 2-year Harris Hip Score was the lowest, all patients had good to excellent results. In conclusion, minimally invasive hip replacement in obese patients provides early outcomes comparable to those in nonobese patients.
