{"id":18614,"title":"Managing the open abdomen in a district general hospital.","abstract":"The need to manage an open abdomen is becoming more common in general surgical practice and a variety of methods of temporary abdominal closure (TAC) are available. The evidence for the efficacy of the various forms of TAC as well as the subsequent definitive fascial closure (DFC) rates and complications comes mainly from large trauma series in the US, which represent a different patient population to those in the UK in whom TAC is usually required.All cases of open abdomen management in our hospital over a five-year period were reviewed to ascertain the methods of TAC used, our success in achieving DFC and the applicability of managing such cases in a district hospital environment.Nineteen patients underwent TAC, with two deaths (10.5%) and an overall DFC rate at hospital discharge of 12/17 (70.6%). The median lengths of critical care and hospital stays were 19.5 and 38.0 days respectively. Thirteen out of seventeen survivors had at least one significant complication.The management of the open abdomen can be achieved safely in a district general hospital setting with acceptable outcomes for the non-trauma patients commonly seen in UK practice but it is a resource intensive and expensive undertaking.","date":"2014-04-30","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780782","annotations":[{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.642155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.481943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.387695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"General surgery","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_surgery"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.153909,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.135327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0460226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_Kingdom)"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"1217","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1217"},{"name":"District","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District"},{"name":"Variety show","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show"},{"name":"Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Horse length","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length"},{"name":"District hospital","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_hospital"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Natural resource","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Military discharge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge"},{"name":"10.5 (TV miniseries)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10.5_(TV_miniseries)"}]}
