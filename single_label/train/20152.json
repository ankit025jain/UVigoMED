{"id":20152,"title":"Liposuction and lipofilling for treatment of symptomatic silicone toxicosis of the gluteal region.","abstract":"Silicone injection can cause numerous posttreatment complications-including debilitating pain, cellulitis, abscesses, overlying skin compromise, and siliconomas distorting overlying tissues-that can be difficult to manage.The authors evaluate liposuction as a treatment for patients experiencing complications from silicone injections to the gluteal region, to both preserve aesthetic appearance and minimize further risk of complication from these procedures.Eight patients (7 women and 1 man) who presented consecutively to us between 2010 and 2013 with complications from silicone injections to their gluteal region were enrolled in this study. Each patient was evaluated by computed tomography scan and a 0 to 6 visual analog scale for pain. Emergency room (ER) visits, previous hospital admissions, and cellulitis requiring antibiotics in the 12 months prior to treatment were recorded. Patients were treated with ultrasonic and standard liposuction followed by lipotransfer into the gluteal musculature. A Student t test was used for statistical comparison of pre- and postoperative values.Average patient age was 36 years (range, 25-43 years). All patients initially presented with intense pain as assessed by a visual analog scale; by the 12th week postoperatively, the entire cohort experienced remission in pain. At 1 year postoperatively, no patients had infections (vs 75% preoperatively; P = .028), visited the ER (vs 50% preoperatively; P = .058), or were hospitalized (vs an average of 1.5 hospitalizations per patient preoperatively; P = .066).Liposuction with immediate intramuscular fat transfer for buttock augmentation appears to be a safe surgical option that preserves aesthetic appearance for patients with gluteal silicone toxicosis.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676144","annotations":[{"name":"Liposuction","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposuction"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.804461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Fat","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat"},{"name":"Silicone","weight":0.80205,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Antibacterial","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Buttocks","weight":0.736259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.675683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.655988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.560642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Fat transfer","weight":0.413682,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_transfer"},{"name":"Cellulitis","weight":0.34911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulitis"},{"name":"Intramuscular injection","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuscular_injection"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.310706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.25589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.21786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aesthetics","weight":0.189122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Gluteal muscles","weight":0.118921,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteal_muscles"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Tonne","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne"},{"name":"Buttock augmentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttock_augmentation"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Breast augmentation","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_augmentation"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0263964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Visual system","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_system"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Structural analog","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analog"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"}]}
