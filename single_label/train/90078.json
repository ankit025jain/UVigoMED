{"id":90078,"title":"[Case-control study on dynamic hip screw and proximal femoral nail anti-rotation for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients].","abstract":"To retrospectivly compare the clinical efficacy of dynamic hip screw (DHS) with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly.Totally 92 elderly patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures were treated with DHS [including 27 males and 23 females with a mean age of (72.5 +/- 5.3) years old] and PFNA [including 22 males and 20 females with a mean age of (72.8 +/- 5.8) years old] from August 2008 to August 2012. The data of operation time,blood loss (obvious and hidden blood loss), bedridden time, down load time, postoperative complications and Harris hip function score were recorded and compared.Both of two groups were followed-up for 10 to 18 months with an average of 13.5 months. PFNA was implanted with a significantly smaller incision and shorter clinical healing time, less blood loss,while hidden blood loss were more. Postoperative complications, therapeutic effects and Harris score in PFNA group were better than that of DHS group.For treatment of senile patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures, PFNA was superior to DHS in reducing complication rates, recovering hip joint, while DHS could reduce perioperative blood loss in treating type II a, II b and III fracture.","date":"2014-03-24","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24654509","annotations":[{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.725984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.647429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.638673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Hip fracture","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_fracture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.441245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.434864,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.292202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.21624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Hip","weight":0.151596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.115795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.114162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Dynamic hip screw","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_hip_screw"},{"name":"Perfluorononanoic acid","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorononanoic_acid"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"United States Department of Health and Human Services","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Loader (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(computing)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Screw","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Perioperative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
