{"id":78509,"title":"MRI artefacts after Bonebridge implantation.","abstract":"The new transcutaneous bone conduction implant (BCI) Bonebridge (BB, MED-EL) allows the skin to remain intact and therefore overcomes some issues related to percutaneous systems, such as skin reaction around the external screw and cosmetic complaints. According to manufacturer, BB is MRI conditional up to 1,5 Tesla (T). The artefact of the neurocranium after BB implantation is extensive as shown in the present report. This has to be taken into account when patients suffering conductive, mixed or single-sided hearing loss with candidacy for a BCI are counselled. In patients with comorbid intracranial tumour or other diseases of the brain that require imaging control scans with MRI percutaneous, BCI should be the implant of choice considering the very small artefact of the percutaneous screw in MRI.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639341","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.709788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.663186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.657081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.387536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Bone conduction","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_conduction"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.23057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.103496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Manufacturing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"},{"name":"Cosmetics","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.0694895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Electrical conductor","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"},{"name":"Transdermal","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal"},{"name":"Neurocranium","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurocranium"},{"name":"Artifact (archaeology)","weight":0.027714,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Audio mixing (recorded music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)"},{"name":"Brain-computer interface","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-computer_interface"},{"name":"Nikola Tesla","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"}]}
