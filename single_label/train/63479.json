{"id":63479,"title":"Preventing pregnancy loss.","abstract":"In this issue of Blood, 2 articles by The Nimes Obstetricians and Hematologistsâ€“Antiphospholipid Syndrome (NOH-APS) Study Group give us new information about the effects of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on pregnancy complications in women with prior pregnancy loss and either purely obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) or inherited thrombophilia. The results better define women at risk, suggest a role for LMWH, and confirm the need for further investigation.","date":"2014-01-17","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24434995","annotations":[{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Heparin","weight":0.777439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heparin"},{"name":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","weight":0.764248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_syndrome"},{"name":"Thrombophilia","weight":0.73303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombophilia"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.585738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.565524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Obstetrics","weight":0.445367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.396595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.322781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.26328,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Complications of pregnancy","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complications_of_pregnancy"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Nimes","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimes"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"American Physical Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Physical_Society"},{"name":"Study Group International","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_Group_International"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"}]}
