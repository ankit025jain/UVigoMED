{"id":56818,"title":"[Study on causes of ophthalmologists' inertia in glaucoma treatment].","abstract":"The problem of inertia in ophthalmological practice, which implies the absence of any adjustment of the given treatment, even if an adjustment is objectively necessary or clinically indicated, was studied. According to the authors, the problem is most pressing when multifactorial diseases, including primary glaucoma, are concerned. An anonymous survey of 147 ophthalmologists from different West Siberian regions (Altai Krai, Kemerovo region, and Republic of Khakassia) was conducted. The set of causes for ophthalmologists' inertia was identified. The leading cause appeared to be psychological reluctance to achieve target intraocular pressure and overestimation of therapeutic success. Other causes, although less significant, include lack of professional awareness and economic barriers to decision making.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24624804","annotations":[{"name":"Ophthalmology","weight":0.384266,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmology"},{"name":"Siberia","weight":0.360544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.213142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.19543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.190671,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.169122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Altai Krai","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Krai"},{"name":"Inertia","weight":0.0985924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Republic","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"},{"name":"Decision making","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making"},{"name":"Objectivity (science)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science)"},{"name":"Kemerovo","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemerovo"},{"name":"Khakassia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khakassia"},{"name":"Intraocular pressure","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_pressure"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"West Siberian Plain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Siberian_Plain"},{"name":"Maximum break","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_break"},{"name":"Human eye","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye"},{"name":"Altai Mountains","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Mountains"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Primorsky Krai","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorsky_Krai"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Professional","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional"},{"name":"Trade barrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_barrier"},{"name":"Magnetic reluctance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_reluctance"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"}]}
