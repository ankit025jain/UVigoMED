{"id":55302,"title":"Surgical management of long-standing antielevation syndrome after unilateral anterior transposition of the inferior oblique muscle.","abstract":"To investigate surgical management of patients with long-standing antielevation syndrome following unilateral anterior transposition of inferior oblique muscle.We present a series of 3 consecutive patients with significant hypotropia several years after unilateral anterior transposition surgery. An approach combining denervation-extirpation of the inferior oblique muscle and subsequent inferior rectus muscle recession and contralateral superior rectus muscle recession was used to manage all 3 patients.Denervation-extirpation surgery alone or with ipsilateral inferior rectus muscle recession were not enough to improve vertical misalignment in these patients. All 3 patients achieved successful results after denervation-extirpation surgery, ipsilateral inferior rectus muscle recession, and contralateral superior rectus muscle recession.In this case series, devervation-extirpation surgery on the inferior oblique muscle, ipsilateral inferior rectus recession, and contralateral superior rectus recession improved vertical misalignment in patients with long-standing antielevation syndrome after unilateral anterior transposition of the inferior oblique.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924274","annotations":[{"name":"Rectus abdominis muscle","weight":0.769557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectus_abdominis_muscle"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Inferior oblique muscle","weight":0.696813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_oblique_muscle"},{"name":"Abdominal external oblique muscle","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_external_oblique_muscle"},{"name":"Abdominal internal oblique muscle","weight":0.29434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_internal_oblique_muscle"},{"name":"Inferior rectus muscle","weight":0.287608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_rectus_muscle"},{"name":"Superior rectus muscle","weight":0.174805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_rectus_muscle"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Ipsilateral","weight":0.135444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsilateral"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0488747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Hypertropia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertropia"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.028018,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Contralateral","weight":0.0174397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contralateral"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Unilateralism","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateralism"},{"name":"Vertical direction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_direction"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Recession","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"}]}
