{"id":4377,"title":"Retrospective epidemiological analysis of sparganosis in mainland China from 1959 to 2012.","abstract":"In this study, epidemiological factors of sparganosis cases reported in mainland China from 1959 to December 2012 were analysed. A total of 1061 valid cases were distributed throughout most of the provinces of mainland China, with most cases occurring in Southern and Eastern China. The average age of patients was 29 years (range 0-80 years). Modes of transmission to humans were via contact (54·6%), mainly by application of frog meat as a poultice, foodborne (33·8%), mainly through ingesting frogs or snakes, and waterborne (11·5%) through drinking raw water. The tissue/organs involved were subcutaneous/muscle (43·1%), eyes (31·0%), central nervous system (CNS) (17·9%), urogenital system (3·9%) and visceral organs (3·2%). Obvious differences existed in main risk factors for different areas. Close correlation was found between tissue/organs and risk factors. Main modes of transmission changed during the past decades, from contact (83·8% pre-1979) to foodborne (63·9% post-2000). The tissue/organs involved also changed at the same time. Cases involving eyes fell from 50·0% pre-1979 to 8·3% post-2000, and cases involving CNS increased from 0% pre-1979 to 47·8% post-2000. These results illustrate that China is one of the main epidemic countries of sparganosis in the world. Consumption of frog/snake meat was the main risk factor, although application of frog flesh as a poultice was the main risk factor before 2000. Sparganosis has become one of the neglected but important foodborne/waterborne parasitic diseases in mainland China.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25372227","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.811179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Central nervous system","weight":0.769629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system"},{"name":"Parasitism","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism"},{"name":"Frog","weight":0.72325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.703484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"China","weight":0.668012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.649308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.612069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Meat","weight":0.606798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.456322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Mainland China","weight":0.448912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"},{"name":"Sparganosis","weight":0.420754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparganosis"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.403703,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Ingestion","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion"},{"name":"Snake","weight":0.323631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake"},{"name":"Sex organ","weight":0.317786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"},{"name":"Genitourinary system","weight":0.24911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitourinary_system"},{"name":"Foodborne illness","weight":0.151498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"List of human parasitic diseases","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_parasitic_diseases"},{"name":"Viscus","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscus"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Country","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country"},{"name":"Poultice","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultice"},{"name":"Transmission (medicine)","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1959","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Flesh","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Amateur radio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio"},{"name":"Southern United States","weight":0.015901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"},{"name":"Eastern Europe","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"},{"name":"Ferry","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"},{"name":"2012 phenomenon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon"}]}
