{"id":82835,"title":"Hemangioma of the parotid gland: case report.","abstract":"Hemangiomas account for half of the parotid gland tumors occurring in children. After a rapid increase in the first months of life, some of them gradually regress (until complete disappearance) in a period of several years. Hemangiomas that do not regress over time, grow in size (possibly within a short period of time) or develop complications such as intralesional acute bleeding or thrombosis require aggressive therapy: intralesional corticosteroid injection, sclerotherapy. radiation therapy, laser photocoagulation. embolization, or surgical removal. We present the case of a 12-year-old boy with hemangioma of the left parotid gland diagnosed by CT scan, angio-CT with 3D reconstruction and angiography successfully treated by superselective intraarterial embolization with acrylic glue followed after 4 days by left superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505920","annotations":[{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.866526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Corticosteroid","weight":0.810198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.789684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.774202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Sclerotherapy","weight":0.773916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerotherapy"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.717091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Hemangioma","weight":0.692342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.655054,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Laser","weight":0.610052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser"},{"name":"Parotid gland","weight":0.603174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.481318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.43391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.431257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.396365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.296238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.294432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Adhesive","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive"},{"name":"Laser coagulation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_coagulation"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Three-dimensional space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.01376,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"}]}
