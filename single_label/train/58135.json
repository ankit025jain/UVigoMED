{"id":58135,"title":"Successful completion of the first trimester despite the inappropriate rate of rise of the serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels.","abstract":"To report an exception to the rule that once slow rising serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels are observed, a live fetus after 12 weeks is not possible even if fetal viability was detected earlier.The fetus of a woman with a slow rising serum beta-hCG levels which even plateaued was evaluated by serial pelvic sonography.The fetal pole grew appropriately but at one point the sac size was a week behind. Nevertheless the woman completed the first trimester with a viable fetus and a normal fetal heart rate.Though rare, a live fetus at the end of the first trimester is possible if even if there is a slow rise of sera hCG levels where there is at least one instance when the hCG levels do not double in two days.","date":"2014-07-04","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24992789","annotations":[{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Medical ultrasonography","weight":0.778848,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasonography"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.622106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.534161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.509903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.333764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Heart rate","weight":0.279067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"},{"name":"Gonadotropin","weight":0.154985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin"},{"name":"Cardiotocography","weight":0.135948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiotocography"},{"name":"Fetal pole","weight":0.123912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_pole"},{"name":"Fetal circulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_circulation"},{"name":"Normality (behavior)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_(behavior)"}]}
