{"id":56440,"title":"[Modern methods of astigmatism correction in cataract surgery].","abstract":"Modern methods of astigmatism correction in lens surgery are reviewed in the article. Keratorefractive, including laser-assisted, and intraocular techniques employing different models of toric intraocular lenses (IOL) are described. Current state of the problem is analyzed. Implantation of toric IOLs enables precise correction of corneal astigmatism simultaneously with cataract phacoemulsification.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684073","annotations":[{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Astigmatism","weight":0.825294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"},{"name":"Phacoemulsification","weight":0.810695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.767981,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Cornea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea"},{"name":"Toric lens","weight":0.450976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_lens"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.374132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.290315,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Computer simulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation"}]}
