{"id":72734,"title":"Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method?","abstract":"To evaluate accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients after oncoplastic surgery for early breast cancer.A retrospective analysis of 136 breasts of 134 patients, who received breast-conserving oncoplastic surgery for low-risk breast cancer between 2002 and 2010 in the Universities of Vienna and Luebeck followed by adjuvant APBI applying total doses of pulse dose rate of 50.4 Gy or high-dose rate (HDR) of 32 Gy over 4 days. Target volume definition was performed by the use of surgical-free margin data, related to intraoperatively fixed clip positions, pre- and postoperative imaging, and palpation.At the time of data acquisition, 131 of 134 patients were alive. The median follow-up time was 39 months (range, 4-106 months). After high-dose rate treatment, 3 of 89 patients showed systemic progress after a mean follow-up of 47 months (range, 19-75 months) and 2 patients had a different quadrant in-breast tumor after 27 and 35 months. One patient died 7 months after treatment of unknown causes. After pulse dose rate treatment, 1 of 45 patients had a local recurrence after 42 months and 1 patient died because of another cause after 13 months. We observed mild fibrosis in 27 breasts, telangiectasia in 6, hyperpigmentation in 14 cases, and keloid formation in 1.These preliminary results suggest the feasibility of multicatheter APBI after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery in selected low-risk breast cancer patients; however, special attention to target volume definition is needed. Further prospective investigations with long follow-up are needed to define the real value of the procedure.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946973","annotations":[{"name":"Brachytherapy","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachytherapy"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Fibrosis","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis"},{"name":"Keloid","weight":0.756175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.725137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Irradiation","weight":0.642155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation"},{"name":"Telangiectasia","weight":0.520208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangiectasia"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.502354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Contraindication","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraindication"},{"name":"Palpation","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpation"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.372176,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Adjuvant","weight":0.372036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.339804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.293939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Pulse","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"University","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University"},{"name":"Hyperpigmentation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpigmentation"},{"name":"Luebeck","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luebeck"},{"name":"Vienna","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"1975","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975"},{"name":"2002","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Range (particle radiation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(particle_radiation)"},{"name":"Isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"},{"name":"Real number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"},{"name":"Data acquisition","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_acquisition"},{"name":"Target Corporation","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation"},{"name":"Cartesian coordinate system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
