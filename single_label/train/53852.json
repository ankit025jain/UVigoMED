{"id":53852,"title":"Depression, deficits in functional capacity, and impaired glycemic control in urban African Americans with type 2 diabetes.","abstract":"Effective depression treatment does not reliably reduce glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in depressed patients with type 2 diabetes, possibly in part due to deficits in functional capacity, i.e. performance of certain everyday living skills, essential for effective diabetes self-management. We sought to determine: a) the magnitude of deficits in functional capacity among urban, African American (AA) patients with type 2 diabetes, and b) whether these deficits were associated with poorer glycemic control.At their initial visit to an inner-city diabetes clinic, 172 AA patients with type 2 diabetes were assessed with a variety of instruments, including the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the UCSD Performance Skills Assessment-Brief (UPSA-B). They then entered a comprehensive diabetes management intervention, whose success was indexed by HbA1c levels at up to four reassessments over a one-year period. A mixed-effects model repeated-measures method was used to predict HbA1c.The prevalence of depression was 19%; the mean UPSA-B score was 81 Â± 17. After multivariate adjustment, increased HbA1c levels over time were predicted by the presence of major depression (B = .911, p = .002) and decreasing (worse) scores on the UPSA-B (B = -.016, p = .027), respectively. Further adjustment for increasing the dosage of oral or insulin during the treatment eliminated the association between the UPSA score and HbA1c level (B = -.010, p = .115).Depression, as well as deficits in functional capacity, predicted reduced effectiveness of a diabetes self-management intervention. Future studies will determine whether interventions targeted at both improve glycemic control.","date":"2014-03-14","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491959","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.784845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.676801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"University of California, San Diego","weight":0.644492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.563085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.511382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.510706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.428984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.332676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.296406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Race and ethnicity in the United States Census","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Neuropsychiatry","weight":0.205637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatry"},{"name":"Glycemic index","weight":0.156101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.115637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.0555992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Diabetes management","weight":0.0321906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_management"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Alcoholics Anonymous","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Mini","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Interview","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Future studies","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_studies"}]}
