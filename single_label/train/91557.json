{"id":91557,"title":"[Efficacy observation on traumatic nerve injury treated with different acupuncture therapies].","abstract":"To observe the difference in the efficacy on traumatic nerve injury among electroacupuncture, warm needling therapy and electroacupuncture plus warm needling therapy and explore the better therapeutic method.The electromyography (EMG) and electroneurography (ENG) of 93 cases showed traumatic nerve injury of moderate damage. According to the single blind randomization principle, they were divided into an electroacupuncture (EA) group, a warm needling therapy (WN) group and an EA plus WN group, 31 cases in each one. The main acupoints were selected from Yangming Meridian and Shaoyang Meridian corresponding to the distribution of damaged nerves. EA, WN and EA plus WN were applied separately. The treatment was given once every day, 15 treatments made one session. After 3 sessions of treatment (45 treatments in total), EMG and ENG were re-checked and the results were analyzed statistically.Regarding the total effective rate and effective rate, it was 96. 8% (30/31) in the EA plus WN group, which was better than 74.2% (23/31) in the EA group and 77. 4% (24/31) in the WN group (P<0. 05). Concerning to the improvements of EMG, the result in the EA plus WN group was 96.8% (30/31), which was better than the other two groups [74. 2%(23/31),74. 2%(23/31)] (P<0. 05). In terms of the recovery of nerve conduction and amplitude, the results in EA plus WN group [(50.9+/-4. 6)m/s,(8. 8+/-2. 9),microVx1 000] were better than the other two groups [(43.7+/-3.1)m/s,(4. 2+/-1. 9)microV X 1 000,(43. 8+/-3. 3)m/s,(4. 5+/-2. 2)microV X 1 000] (P<0. 05).EA combined with WN is a better therapy of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of traumatic nerve injury.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24494286","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Electromyography","weight":0.839752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Blind experiment","weight":0.737872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_experiment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.308601,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.279505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.222908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"},{"name":"Electroacupuncture","weight":0.136412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacupuncture"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.135596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Electric current","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"},{"name":"Moxibustion","weight":0.123079,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxibustion"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0642319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Shaoyang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaoyang"},{"name":"Nerve injury","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_injury"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.0232009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Electronic Arts","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts"},{"name":"Wang Yangming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yangming"},{"name":"Meridian (geography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"English language","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"},{"name":"Myelin protein zero","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_protein_zero"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"}]}
