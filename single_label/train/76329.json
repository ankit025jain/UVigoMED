{"id":76329,"title":"The Indian National Food Security Act, 2013: a commentary.","abstract":"The National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013, passed recently by the Indian Parliament, aims to ensure food security in India, chiefly by providing cereals at subsidized prices through the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) for about two-thirds of households. The predominant line of criticism of the NFSA has been the costs of such an ambitious rights-based approach in the context of decelerating economic growth and growing fiscal deficits. We argue that the food subsidy has been increasing through the last few decades and is set to climb even higher with this act but that the incremental costs, at about 0.2% of gross domestic product, are not as high as claimed. Further, recent evidence of increasing utilization of the TPDS and decreasing corruption add credence to the act's premise that significant income transfers to poor households can be achieved, thereby promoting food security as well as dietary diversity. Several concerns remain to be addressed in the design and implementation of the act, including its proposed coverage, a cereal-centric approach, the identification of beneficiaries, and its adaptability at the state level. If these are resolved effectively, the act can prove to be a significant step forward in India's long-drawn-out battle against undernutrition and food insecurity. Finally, the NFSA also provides a fresh opportunity to reform and strengthen the TPDS, which has been an integral component of India's strategy to achieve food security at the national level.","date":"2014-07-31","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076773","annotations":[{"name":"Gross domestic product","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"},{"name":"Economic growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.729513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.690241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Subsidy","weight":0.658821,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy"},{"name":"Security","weight":0.575564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security"},{"name":"India","weight":0.556108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Food security","weight":0.552403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Parliament of India","weight":0.466729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.411136,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Multiculturalism","weight":0.360731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"},{"name":"Malnutrition","weight":0.278001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"},{"name":"Reform","weight":0.233385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Fiscal policy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Cereals","weight":0.0353602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereals"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Adaptation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"},{"name":"Battle","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle"},{"name":"Parliament","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament"},{"name":"Distribution (business)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"},{"name":"Public Distribution System","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Distribution_System"},{"name":"Act of Parliament","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Identity document","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"},{"name":"States and territories of India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_India"},{"name":"Utilization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization"},{"name":"U.S. state","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"},{"name":"Iranian Economic Reform Plan","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Economic_Reform_Plan"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Revenue","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue"},{"name":"Marginal cost","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Beneficiary","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficiary"},{"name":"Premise","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise"},{"name":"Criticism","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism"}]}
