{"id":22748,"title":"Neutrophil counts in leptospirosis patients infected with different serovars.","abstract":"In leptospirosis patients, haematological abnormalities have been reported. The aim of this study was to determine if neutrophil counts were different between patients known to be infected with a range of leptospiral serovars. The study retrospectively compared the neutrophil counts from the first blood samples taken from 210 leptospirosis patients at first presentation to a Queensland Health hospital. Significant differences (p <0.001) were observed in neutrophil counts across the 11 different infecting serovars. These findings suggest that neutrophil counts may be useful in the development of an algorithm determining the infecting serovar in suspected leptospirosis patients. Further studies are required to delineate host cytokine responses which may suggest the underlying aetiology of the observed differences in neutrophil counts. Such studies would also provide valuable therapeutic insights into treating the disease.
