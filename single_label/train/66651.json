{"id":66651,"title":"Use of large-volume, fixed-depth, disposable slides for post-vasectomy semen analysis.","abstract":"Vasectomy is the surgical procedure used for male contraception. Traditionally, operative success has been established by the issue of a laboratory report stating the achievement of azoospermia. The purpose of this study is to establish if this is an achievable or realistic status and if a change to the current best practice would provide an acceptable and cost-effective alternative. In principle, human fecundity is complex and measured in probabilities, which is inconsistent with the implied absolute requirement to establish the complete absence of spermatozoa.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693568","annotations":[{"name":"Spermatozoon","weight":0.88138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatozoon"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.508502,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.40749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.354078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.287122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Vasectomy","weight":0.121652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasectomy"},{"name":"Contraception","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraception"},{"name":"Fecundity","weight":0.0969942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecundity"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0644769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Azoospermia","weight":0.0419679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azoospermia"},{"name":"Male contraceptive","weight":0.0381836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_contraceptive"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Microscope slide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_slide"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"Disposable","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable"},{"name":"Best practice","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice"}]}
