{"id":83653,"title":"Adjunctive technique for the use of ProGlide vascular closure device to improve hemostasis.","abstract":"The Perclose ProGlide (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif) is indicated for the closure of 5F to 21 F femoral artery access sites. We describe an adjunctive technique for the use of the ProGlide vascular closure device to improve hemostasis. After routine use of the device, a hollow tube (cut from the injection port of an introducer sheath) is placed over the free tails of suture. These tubes are secured in place by a hemostat that grasps the free suture tails, creating a Rummel-style tourniquet that compresses the arteriotomy, improving hemostasis. The tubes doubly serve as a conduit for the administration of prothrombotic agents directly in the event that hemostasis is not adequately achieved.","date":"2014-12-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25282692","annotations":[{"name":"Artery","weight":0.632167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Tourniquet","weight":0.37411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourniquet"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.354159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Femoral artery","weight":0.269441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_artery"},{"name":"Surgical suture","weight":0.118887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture"},{"name":"Hemostasis","weight":0.0574785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostasis"},{"name":"Hemostat","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemostat"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Injection port","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_port"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Data compression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Port","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port"},{"name":"Adjunct (grammar)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct_(grammar)"},{"name":"Abbott Laboratories","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories"},{"name":"Fallopian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallopian_tube"}]}
