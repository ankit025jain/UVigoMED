{"id":84487,"title":"Local complications of massive bone allografts: an appraisal of their prevalence in 128 patients.","abstract":"Bone allografts were used in our department since twenty-five years to reconstruct segmental bone loss and our data were retrospectively reviewed to assess the complications related to the use of a bone allograft. A consecutive series of 128 patients who received a bone allograft was analyzed. The minimal follow-up was 18 months. Fracture, nonunion, infection and explantation were investigated using a multivariate analysis and logistical regression. Kaplan-Meier survival of the allograft was performed, using allograft removal as the end point. Tumour disease was excluded from this study. Patients were followed up for an average 103 months. Bone tumour occurred in 78% of the patients whereas revision arthroplasty was the cause of implantation in 15% of them. Nonunion was the most prevalent complication, occurring in 35% of the grafts. For nonunion occurrence, the type of reconstruction was found to be a significant variable, the intercalary allograft being the most exposed. Primary bone autografting at the anastomotic site was not significant to prevent nonunion. Fracture of the allograft was the second most frequent complication with a prevalence of 16.4%. The length of the allograft and an osteoarticular allograft were two significant variables in that occurrence. Infection of the allograft was present with a rate of 5.4% of patients. Explantation of failed allografts occurred in 30% of them. The duration of the frozen storage of the allograft and the donor age of the allograft were not significant on any local complication occurrence. Bone allografts are a reliable material but a high rate of local complications must be anticipated.","date":"2014-08-05","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25090792","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.833965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.799086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.797137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.408904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.37066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.363398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Nonunion","weight":0.334237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonunion"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.161111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.124642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Intercalation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Organ donation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Real estate appraisal","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal"},{"name":"Reconstructive plastic surgery","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstructive_plastic_surgery"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Freezing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
