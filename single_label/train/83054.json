{"id":83054,"title":"A polysomnographic and clinical study of sleep disorders in patients with Behçet and neuro-Behçet syndrome.","abstract":"Brainstem is the most common site of involvement in neuro-Behçet syndrome (NBS). On the other hand, the critical importance of this anatomical region in the regulation of sleep has been disregarded in the literature. We aimed to investigate the microstructure of sleep in patients with Behçet syndrome (BS) and NBS. Patients were allocated to 2 groups: (1) BS without any neurological involvement and (2) NBS with brainstem lesions only. A control group was also enrolled in this study. The comparison of polysomnographic parameters between all patients (BS and NBS) with the control group showed that sleep onset was longer (p = 0.006), the duration of superficial NREM sleep stage (N2) was significantly longer (p = 0.018), and the respiratory disturbance index was significantly higher (p = 0.034) in patients. Sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome are more commonly observed in BS and NBS. Our findings emphasize the importance of questioning the quality of sleep and its disorders in patients with BS in order to better handle the common somatic complaints in these patients, such as fatigue or daytime sleepiness","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24457203","annotations":[{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Restless legs syndrome","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_legs_syndrome"},{"name":"Non-rapid eye movement sleep","weight":0.821646,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-rapid_eye_movement_sleep"},{"name":"Somnolence","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somnolence"},{"name":"Brainstem","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.694782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Heart disease","weight":0.644446,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"},{"name":"Sleep disorder","weight":0.637607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.629712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.568721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Excessive daytime sleepiness","weight":0.464781,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excessive_daytime_sleepiness"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.274442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Disorder (medicine)","weight":0.267888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorder_(medicine)"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0717429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Respiratory Disturbance Index","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_Disturbance_Index"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Human leg","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leg"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Questioning (sexuality and gender)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questioning_(sexuality_and_gender)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Bachelor of Science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Microstructure","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstructure"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"N2 road (South Africa)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N2_road_(South_Africa)"}]}
