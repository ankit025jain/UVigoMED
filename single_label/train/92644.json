{"id":92644,"title":"Tight junction protein claudin-4 is modulated via ?Np63 in human keratinocytes.","abstract":"In the epidermis, tight junction (TJ) structure is specifically located in the stratum granulosum, where the expression of ?Np63, a p53 family transcription factor, is attenuated. Since the relationship between ?Np63 and barrier function has not been fully uncovered, we assessed expression profiles of TJ proteins in skin tissues and cultured keratinocytes. The results showed that expression of ?Np63 and that of claudin-4 were inversely correlated in healthy human epidermis. In vitro studies using HaCaT keratinocytes revealed functional relevance of ?Np63 and claudin-4. Curiously, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 ligand, which is known to be liberated from damaged cells, suppressed ?Np63 expression and concomitantly upregulated claudin-4 expression in primary keratinocytes. More interestingly, a broad expression pattern of claudin-4 was found in the epidermis of atopic dermatitis (AD), a barrier defect disorder, which contains ?Np63-lacking keratinocytes as we reported previously. Therefore, upregulation of claudin-4 expression regulated by ?Np63 might be associated with complementary or repair responses of damaged keratinocytes with AD.
