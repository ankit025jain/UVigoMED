{"id":15886,"title":"[Effect of interleukin-17 on neutrophil apoptosis in patients with tuberculosis].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of interleukin (IL)-17 on the apoptosis of neutrophils (PMNs) from peripheral blood of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and explore the possible involved signaling pathway.The fresh isolated PMNs from peripheral blood of TB patients and healthy adults were cultured for 0-24 hours, and then stained with annexin V. The flow cytometry was used to measure cell apoptosis of PMNs. The fresh isolated PMNs were cultured with different concentrations of IL-17 for 24 hours, with or without pretreatment of MAPK inhibitor U0126 for 30 minutes, the apoptosis of PMNs was detected by flow cytometry.The apoptosis of PMNs in both TB patients and healthy adults increased with the culture time going on (P<0.05). The spontaneous apoptotic (annexin V?) rates of PMNs at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours of culture time in TB patients were (4.49 ± 1.39)%, (21.89 ± 2.90)%, (39.96 ± 4.15)%, and (68.35 ± 7 .01)%, respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding ones in normal healthy groups, (2.65 ± 0.75)%, (11.00 ± 1.72)%, (25.84 ± 3.90)%, and (45.59 ± 4.10)%, respectively (P<0.05). After cultured with IL-17 for 24 hours, the apoptotic rates of PMNs in TB patients and healthy adults were respectively (59.81 ± 7.19)% and (34.65 ± 4.79)% in the group of IL-17 at 0.5 ?g/L, and (51.62 ± 6.91)% and (29.04 ± 3.62)% in the group of IL-17 at 5 ?g/L; they were significantly lower than those in control groups without IL-17, (68.35 ± 7.01)% and (45.59 ± 4.10)%, respectively, (P<0.05). However, in the group of IL-17 at 50 ?g/L, the apoptosis rates of PMNs in TB patients and healthy adults were (76.04 ± 5.59)% and (53.24 ± 4.62)%, respectively, which were obviously higher than those of the control groups without IL-17 (P<0.05). Pretreatment of PMNs with U0126 mostly inhibited the anti-apoptosis effect of IL-17 at 5 ?g/L on PMNs of TB patients and normal subjects.The apoptosis of PMNs in both TB patients and healthy adults increases along with the culture time, and the apoptosis rate of PMNs in TB patients is higher than that of healthy adults. The lower concentrations of IL-17 can delay, but the higher concentration of Il-17 can accelerate the apoptosis of PMNs in TB patients. The inhibitory role of IL-17 in apoptosis of PMNs may be involved in the ERK pathway.","date":"2014-08-11","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108437","annotations":[{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.898823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Neutrophil granulocyte","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.876779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Interleukin 17","weight":0.854624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_17"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Mitogen-activated protein kinase","weight":0.825521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitogen-activated_protein_kinase"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.817254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Granulocyte","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulocyte"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Interleukin","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"MAPK/ERK pathway","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPK/ERK_pathway"},{"name":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases","weight":0.532061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_signal-regulated_kinases"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.490891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.294327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.272966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.255994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.255405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.140005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Venous blood","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_blood"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Annexin A5","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin_A5"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Activation energy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy"},{"name":"Vanadium","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
