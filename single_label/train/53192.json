{"id":53192,"title":"Contrast-harmonic endoscopic ultrasound for the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a prospective multicenter trial.","abstract":"Histology is the gold standard for the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, the negative predictive value of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for the diagnosis remains low. The aims of this prospective multicenter study were: (1) to compare the performance of contrast-harmonic EUS (CH-EUS) with that of EUS-FNA for the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma; (2) to assess the intra- and interobserver concordances of CH-EUS.A total of 100 consecutive patients with a solid pancreatic mass of unknown origin were prospectively included at three centers (July 2009?-?April 2010). All patients were examined by CH-EUS followed by EUS-FNA. Absence of vascular enhancement at CH-EUS was regarded as a sign for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The final diagnosis (gold standard) was based on pathological examination (EUS-FNA, surgery) or 12-month follow-up.?The final diagnoses were: 69 adenocarcinoma, 10 neuroendocrine tumors, 13 chronic pancreatitis, and 8 other lesions. In diagnosing adenocarcinoma, CH-EUS and EUS-FNA had respective accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 95?%, 96?%, 94?%, 97?%, and 91?%, and of 95?%, 93?%, 100?%, 100?%, and 86?% without significant difference. Five false-negative cases with EUS-FNA were correctly classified by CH-EUS.?Interobserver agreement (seven endosonographers) was good (kappa 0.66). Intraobserver agreement was good to excellent (kappa 0.76 for junior, 0.90 for senior).The performance of CH-EUS for the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was excellent. The good intra- and interobserver concordances suggest an excellent reproducibility. CH-EUS could help to guide the choice between surgery and follow-up when EUS-FNA is inconclusive.","date":"2014-04-17","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532350","annotations":[{"name":"Positive predictive value","weight":0.850827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"},{"name":"Endoscopic ultrasound","weight":0.836325,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopic_ultrasound"},{"name":"Pancreatitis","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.812713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine tumor","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_tumor"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.755234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Neuroendocrine cell","weight":0.74916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine_cell"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pancreas","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pancreatic cancer","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.559834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.453927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Chronic pancreatitis","weight":0.385962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pancreatitis"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.321392,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.169108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Negative predictive value","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_predictive_value"},{"name":"Pulmonary aspiration","weight":0.0297094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Absenteeism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absenteeism"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
