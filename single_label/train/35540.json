{"id":35540,"title":"[Former preterm infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia: how will this be cared for in 2014?].","abstract":"Major improvements in perinatal care have led to increased survival after premature birth and have allowed the survival of very young and immature newborns. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a serious complication of prematurity and has become a developmental lung disorder, hardly preventable due to its multiple causes. The treatment serves to maintain a normal growth, reduce the respiratory workload, and prevent further complications, by trying not to interfer with postnatal lung development. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia may be associated with bronchial hyperreactivity and an obstructive bronchial pattern that may lead to frequent hospital admissions for reactive airway disease in the small child, and contribute to the persistence of chronic lung disease mainly as a new chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phenotype in adulthood.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640278","annotations":[{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Preterm birth","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth"},{"name":"Phenotype","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.739033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Pregnancy","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.665309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Respiratory system","weight":0.650959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.582717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.558467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.491694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Postnatal","weight":0.482562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnatal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.450962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.444231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.410276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia","weight":0.303889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchopulmonary_dysplasia"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.298803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.216904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Dysplasia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysplasia"},{"name":"Developmental psychology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"}]}
