{"id":84066,"title":"Saving our smallest patients.","abstract":"The feedback from the staff that participated in the Full Scale Drill was overwhelmingly positive. Working and becoming acquainted with members from other supporting departments is critical to a successful evacuation. They enjoyed being a part of the drill and expressed that having ownership of an evacuation plan is vital in the care of our babies. This turned out to be a remarkable team building exercise on many levels. The planning team achieved its overall goal of creating a sense of control over a potentially chaotic environment and now believes that they could execute an evacuation for any reason with maximum protection for their patients. In a similar way various groups in and outside of the Medical Center have an understanding of the complexities of this patient group and what would be needed to effectively support their needs in a disaster. The NICU/CCN Evacuation Committee looks back over almost a year of hard work with tremendous satisfaction and renewed confidence.","date":"2014-09-03","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25181794","annotations":[{"name":"Reason","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason"},{"name":"Feedback","weight":0.281224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Disaster","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Capital punishment","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"},{"name":"Chaos theory","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory"},{"name":"Planning","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Confidence trick","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick"},{"name":"Drill","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill"},{"name":"Emergency evacuation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_evacuation"},{"name":"Self-efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy"},{"name":"Italian conquest of British Somaliland","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_conquest_of_British_Somaliland"},{"name":"Team building","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_building"},{"name":"Full Scale (band)","weight":0.0148276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Scale_(band)"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Ministry (government department)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)"},{"name":"Working (musical)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_(musical)"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"}]}
