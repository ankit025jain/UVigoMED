{"id":32277,"title":"Endovascular treatment of cervical intramedullary arteriovenous malformation.","abstract":"Intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the cervical region are a rare clinical condition. They represent a therapeutic challenge, as the lesions may cause serious functional disorders due to their location within or immediately adjacent to the critical ascending and descending sensorimotor pathways. In this case report, we present a patient with a cervical intramedullary AVM that was treated with endovascular therapy. Our experience suggests that endovascular treatment is an effective and safe method for treating AVMs located in the cervical region of the spinal cord. More studies are needed to establish appropriate treatment protocols depending on the clinical course, the anatomy of the lesion, and the region in which it is found.
