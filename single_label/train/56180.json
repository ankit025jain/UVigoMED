{"id":56180,"title":"Stem cells: Immunology and immunomodulation.","abstract":"Multipotent progenitor cells have the ability to differentiate in vitro into tissue-specific cells under the proper cellular signaling conditions. Because of this intrinsic property, pluripotent derived stem cells from embryonic tissues, induced from genetic reprogramming of somatic cells or from mesenchymal cells, have become the focus of many regenerative medicine studies directed toward application to clinical settings. Generation of retinal pigment epithelium derived from patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem cells may create the ability to recapitulate the disease state and screen new therapeutics, improving upon the limited treatment strategies currently available for afflicted patients. However, the method of delivery, cell culture differentiation, and immunological rejection are some of the limitations that continue to influence ongoing attempts for clinical applications. Understanding stem cell properties and the immune responses these cells elicit in vitro and in vivo will be of importance for designing successful protocols to overcome these immunological limitations. This chapter examines the immunological and immunomodulatory properties of multipotent stem cells in an attempt to provide insights for successful cellular transplantation.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732766","annotations":[{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.832662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Regenerative medicine","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_medicine"},{"name":"Multipotent","weight":0.805351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotent"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.796297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Induced pluripotent stem cell","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.785244,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Progenitor cell","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"},{"name":"Pluripotent","weight":0.775452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluripotent"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Retinal pigment epithelium","weight":0.754279,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Multipotency","weight":0.751686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotency"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Epithelium","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.726843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cell","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesenchymal_stem_cell"},{"name":"Immune system","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Somatic cell","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell"},{"name":"Embryo","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.682086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Pigment","weight":0.666962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.615919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.555405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.550108,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Immunity (medical)","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)"},{"name":"Ancestor","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor"},{"name":"Retina","weight":0.139629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0546142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Reprogramming","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprogramming"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"}]}
