{"id":89668,"title":"[Dual plating fixation for distal fibular comminuted fractures].","abstract":"To evaluate the technique and effectiveness of dual plating fixation for distal fibular comminuted fractures.Between November 2010 and November 2011, 16 patients with distal fibular comminuted fractures were treated, including 10 males and 6 females with an average age of 49.8 years (range, 35-65 years). All the patients had closed injury, which was caused by sprain in 9 cases, by traffic accident in 5 cases, and by falling in 2 cases. The average interval from injury to admission was 8 hours (range, 1-48 hours). Routine X-ray and CT scan were taken for confirmation of classification and involvement. According to Weber classification system, 11 cases were rated as type A, and 5 as type B; 5 cases had bimalleolar fractures with medial malleolar fracture, and 2 cases had trimalleolar fractures with posterior and medial malleolar fracture. Open reduction and dual plating fixation were performed after swelling was subsided. The X-ray films were taken during follow-up. The effectiveness was evaluated with visual analogue scale (VAS) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot and ankle score system at last follow-up. The range of motion (ROM) of the ankle and complications were also been recorded.Delayed healing of incision occurred in 1 patient with diabetes, who was cured after changing dressing; primary healing was obtained in the other patients. Twelve patients were followed up 18 months on average (range, 12-24 months). Radiographic examination demonstrated the mean time of bone healing was 12 weeks (range, 10-14 weeks). No complication of implant failure, malunion, nonunion, or post-traumatic arthritis occurred during follow-up. The AOFAS hindfoot and ankle score was 79.6 +/- 6.5, and the VAS score was 1.3 +/- 1.5. The ROM of the ankle was (70.0 +/- 8.0) degrees of flexion and (84.0 +/- 5.1) degrees of extension.Dual plating fixation for distal fibular comminuted fractures can obtain a rigid stabilization with a low complication incidence, so it is a safe and effective method.","date":"2014-04-03","categories":"Wounds and
