{"id":83124,"title":"Dendritic cell neurofibroma with pseudorosettes: a clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 5 intraoral cases.","abstract":"We report cases of dendritic cell neurofibroma with pseudorosettes (DCNP) presenting in the oral cavity and discuss clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features that differentiate this from other benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors.DCNPs were identified over a 2-year period, and history and histopathologic features were reviewed. Common nerve sheath tumors from the same period were identified and compared.Five intraoral cases of DCNP presented in 2 men and 3 women, with a median age of 59 years. Three presented on the buccal mucosa, and 2 presented on the tongue. Each exhibited a biphasic population of cells with pseudorosettes and strong CD57 positivity.With 31 cases of DCNP reported, the most common site of occurrence is now the head and neck region. DCNPs exhibit a characteristic biphasic population of cells and strong CD57 positivity. Pathologists should consider this diagnosis when confronted with unusual neural lesions.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439917","annotations":[{"name":"Dendritic cell","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell"},{"name":"Oral mucosa","weight":0.833825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_mucosa"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.793157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Neurofibroma","weight":0.788537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibroma"},{"name":"Peripheral nerve","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nerve"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.745082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Tongue","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.703731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.688347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Dendrite","weight":0.66223,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite"},{"name":"Peripheral nervous system","weight":0.525798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.352145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Cheek","weight":0.257798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Condom","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Dental caries","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_caries"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}]}
