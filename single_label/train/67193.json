{"id":67193,"title":"Immunomodulating and antiproteinuric effect of Hippophae rhamnoides (Badriphal) in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.","abstract":"The treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is still not well settled and at times is very frustrating. Number of protocols have been reported with variable results outcome in various conditions. The main pillar of treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is use of immunomodulating and suppressive drugs in various combinations. The herbal preparations have also been reported to have immunomodulating property. The study has been planned to record Immunomodulating and antiproteinuric effect of Hippophae rhamnoides.In the present study had 2 groups having 28 patients of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in each group have been included. The patients were subjected to haematological, biochemical, immunological investigation at 0, 1, 2 and 3 months interval with dietic advise. Group A have been put on standard treatment, whereas group B on Badriphal in the well worked up doses. The hydroalcoholic extract of 350 mg twice daily of Badriphal was given to group B as add on treatment. Patients were followed up with definite protocol at monthly interval for 3 months.At the end of 3 month patients showed improvement in the symptoms of oedema, anorexia, oliguria in the herbal group. The urinary estimation of protein showed significant decrease in Group B with elevation of S. albumin levels. The inflammatory cytokines has showed significant decrease at the end of 3 month.Thus the pilot study showed beneficial effect of the herbal preparation Hippophae rhamnoides as add on treatment. A large perspective study is recommended to establish these findings.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24640205","annotations":[{"name":"Nephrotic syndrome","weight":0.896008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome"},{"name":"Oliguria","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliguria"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.829773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Immunomodulation therapy","weight":0.748635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunomodulation_therapy"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.745461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.735541,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Cytokine","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.663387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.64597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Herbalism","weight":0.600491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.240536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Sea-buckthorn","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea-buckthorn"},{"name":"Hippophae rhamnoides","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippophae_rhamnoides"},{"name":"Column","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Property","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property"},{"name":"350","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Perspective (graphical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)"},{"name":"Elevation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"}]}
