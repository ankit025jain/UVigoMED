{"id":86395,"title":"Erlotinib in African Americans with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a prospective randomized study with genetic and pharmacokinetic analyses.","abstract":"Prospective studies on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in African Americans with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not previously been performed. In this phase II randomized study, 55 African Americans with NSCLC received 150?mg/day erlotinib or a body weight-adjusted dose with subsequent escalations to the maximum-allowable dose, 200?mg/day, to achieve rash. Erlotinib and OSI-420 exposures were lower than those observed in previous studies, consistent with CYP3A pharmacogenetics implying higher metabolic activity. Tumor genetics showed only two EGFR mutations, EGFR amplification in 17/47 samples, eight KRAS mutations, and five EML4-ALK translocations. Although absence of rash was associated with shorter time to progression (TTP), disease-control rate, TTP, and 1-year survival were not different between the two dose groups, indicating the dose-to-rash strategy failed to increase clinical benefit. Low incidence of toxicity and low erlotinib exposure suggest standardized and maximum-allowable dosing may be suboptimal in African Americans.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24781527","annotations":[{"name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor"},{"name":"Erlotinib","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlotinib"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.853189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Epidermal growth factor","weight":0.822584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor"},{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.822198,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Cytochrome P450","weight":0.802802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.795648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.788036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Non-small-cell lung carcinoma","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_carcinoma"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.688752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Pharmacogenetics","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenetics"},{"name":"Growth factor","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.561886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Chromosomal translocation","weight":0.471989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.422795,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"African American","weight":0.225945,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Randomization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization"},{"name":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombotic_thrombocytopenic_purpura"},{"name":"African people","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people"},{"name":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaplastic_lymphoma_kinase"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"}]}
