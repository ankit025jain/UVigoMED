{"id":43236,"title":"An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer.","abstract":"Patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) have a poor outcome. We performed an updated meta-analysis to assess the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). By searching electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) and ASCO proceedings from 1990 to 2012, all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the effect of NAC combined surgery versus surgery alone in advanced gastric and gastroesophageal cancer would be included. All calculations and statistical tests were performed. Twelve RCTs with a total of 1,820 patients were included. All patients had resectable gastric or gastroesophageal cancer and received NAC. NAC can slightly improve the survival rate [OR = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-1.64, P = 0.01], little, or no significant benefits were suggested in subgroup analyses between different population and regimens either. It can significantly improved the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) [OR: 1.85 (1.39, 2.46), p < .0001], tumor down-staging rate [OR: 1.71 (1.26, 2.33), p = .0006] and R0 resection rate [OR: 1.38 (1.08, 1.78) p = .01] of patients with AGC. There were no difference between the two arms, in terms of relapse rates [OR: 1.03 (0.60, 1.78), p = 0.92], operative complications [OR: 1.20 (0.90, 1.58), p = 0.21], perioperative mortality [OR: 1.14 (0.64, 2.05), p = 0.65], and grade 3/4 adverse effects. NAC can significantly down-stage the tumor and improve R0 resection rate of patients with gastric and gastroesophageal cancer. It is safe and feasible, and can be tolerated. NAC can slightly improve the survival rate. It needs further prospective multinational multicenter RCTs to define the clinical benefits of NAC and the most effective strategies for gastric and gastroesophageal cancer.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24800782","annotations":[{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.925798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.892542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.847261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.815595,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.775297,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.769744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Subgroup analysis","weight":0.657982,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup_analysis"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Esophageal cancer","weight":0.609267,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.484469,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Stomach cancer","weight":0.436145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.393623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.382994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.310879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Statistical hypothesis testing","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.259122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease","weight":0.15322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.0790607,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Multicenter trial","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicenter_trial"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Perioperative mortality","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perioperative_mortality"},{"name":"EMBASE","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMBASE"},{"name":"Multinational corporation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"American Society of Clinical Oncology","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Clinical_Oncology"},{"name":"Grade (education)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(education)"}]}
