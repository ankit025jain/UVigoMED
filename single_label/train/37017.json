{"id":37017,"title":"Steroids and injury to the developing brain: net harm or net benefit?","abstract":"Deleterious effects result from both glucocorticoid insufficiency and excess glucocorticoid tissue exposure in the developing brain. Accumulating evidence suggests a net benefit of postnatal glucocorticoid therapy when administered shortly after the first week of life to premature infants with early and persistent pulmonary dysfunction, particularly in those with evidence of relative adrenal insufficiency. The decision to treat with steroids should ensure maximum respiratory benefit at the lowest possible neurologic risk, while avoiding serious systemic complications. Ongoing clinical trials must validate this approach.
