{"id":61383,"title":"[Treatment approaches for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma].","abstract":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and is regarded as a heterogeneous group of lymphomas in terms of morphologic, immunologic, and cytogenetic features. The 2008 WHO classification divides DLBCL into subtypes based on clinical, morphological, immunological, and genetic features. The current standard of care for DLBCL is CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) combined with rituximab, anti-CD20 antibody, allowing many patients to achieve disease cure. Despite of recent progress in improving patient survival, clinical outcomes are still unsatisfactory for certain subtypes of DLBCL. This review outlines the current treatment strategy for DLBCL and focuses on recent clinical trials in Japan for particular subgroups of DLBCL.","date":"2014-04-14","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24724408","annotations":[{"name":"Vincristine","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincristine"},{"name":"Cyclophosphamide","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclophosphamide"},{"name":"Rituximab","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rituximab"},{"name":"Doxorubicin","weight":0.906986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin"},{"name":"Prednisone","weight":0.889548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Lymphoma","weight":0.818199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Immunology","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.701037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Cure","weight":0.552406,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.361139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Japan","weight":0.335845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"},{"name":"CHOP","weight":0.229709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHOP"},{"name":"Standard of care","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care"},{"name":"Diffusion","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"}]}
