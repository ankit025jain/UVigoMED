{"id":19893,"title":"[Morbid obesity in total knee arthroplasty: a critical case review].","abstract":"In a 66-year-old obese woman (WHO stage III, BMI 51?kg/m2) pronounced osteoarthritis of the right knee was diagnosed. Because of progressive chronic pain of the right knee joint her walking distance was limited to a few meters. Conservative therapy was exhausted.Clinical examination showed a restricted and painful range of motion of the right knee and distinctive obeseness on the trunk and the extremities including a lipedema/lymphedema.After a complicated course of treatment lasting for 220 days the total knee replacement ended in an arthrodesis combined with a gastrocnemius muscle flap.With respect to this case the high complication-rates in obese patients should be taken into account: Total knee replacement can even lead to loss of the limb in the worst case. In addition to extended preoperative examination this indication should be critically scrutinized.","date":"2014-04-02","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24691690","annotations":[{"name":"Osteoarthritis","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.829843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.792293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.773888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.757697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.676635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.632449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Arthrodesis","weight":0.619889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrodesis"},{"name":"Arthroplasty","weight":0.572514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroplasty"},{"name":"Walking","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking"},{"name":"Gastrocnemius muscle","weight":0.506947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrocnemius_muscle"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Knee replacement","weight":0.359068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_replacement"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.232283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Range of motion","weight":0.211764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_of_motion"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.195775,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0738637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Conservative Party (UK)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Metre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre"},{"name":"Motion (physics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"},{"name":"Best, worst and average case","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best,_worst_and_average_case"},{"name":"220","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/220"},{"name":"Kilogram-force","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"}]}
