{"id":27763,"title":"Gender abuse, depressive symptoms, and substance use among transgender women: a 3-year prospective study.","abstract":"We examined the effects of gender abuse (enacted stigma), depressive symptoms, and demographic, economic, and lifestyle factors on substance use among transgender women.We conducted a 3-year prospective study (December 2004 to September 2007) of 230 transgender women aged 19 to 59 years from the New York Metropolitan Area. Statistical techniques included generalized estimating equations with logistic and linear regression links.Six-month prevalence of any substance use at baseline was 76.2%. Across assessment points, gender abuse was associated with alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, or any substance use during the previous 6 months, the number of days these substances were used during the previous month, and the number of substances used. Additional modeling associated changes in gender abuse with changes in substance use across time. Associations of gender abuse and substance use were mediated 55% by depressive symptoms. Positive associations of employment income, sex work, transgender identity, and hormone therapy with substance use were mediated 19% to 42% by gender abuse.Gender abuse, in conjunction with depressive symptoms, is a pervasive and moderately strong risk factor for substance use among transgender women. Improved substance abuse treatment is sorely needed for this population.","date":"2014-10-09","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211716","annotations":[{"name":"Cannabis","weight":0.842258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Social stigma","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Cocaine","weight":0.776801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.733959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.699865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"Substance abuse","weight":0.683953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Employment","weight":0.571548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.556715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.543289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.53057,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"Sex worker","weight":0.530251,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker"},{"name":"Identity (social science)","weight":0.48467,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Transgender","weight":0.42307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.402019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Hormone therapy","weight":0.394258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy"},{"name":"Abuse","weight":0.387497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.359522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Income","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.11317,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Drug rehabilitation","weight":0.108778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"New York","weight":0.0530024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"New York metropolitan area","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"2004","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Estimation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation"},{"name":"Psychological testing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_testing"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Non-governmental organization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"},{"name":"Metropolitan area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"}]}
