{"id":11304,"title":"The mutual influences between depressed Macaca fascicularis mothers and their infants.","abstract":"To assess the influence of infant rearing on the behavior of depressed adult female Macaca fascicularis and the influence of depressed infant-rearing adult female Macaca fascicularis on their infants in a free enclosure environment.Here, 20 depressed subjects and then 20 healthy subjects were randomly selected from a total population of 1007 adult female Macaca fascicularis subjects. Four depressed subjects and eight healthy subjects were rearing infants. By focal observation, three trained observers video-recorded the selected subjects over a total observational period of 560 hours. The video footage was analyzed by qualified blinded analysts that coded the raw footage into quantitative behavioral data (i.e., durations of 53 pre-defined behavioral items across 12 behavioral categories) for statistical analysis.Between infant-rearing and non-rearing healthy subjects, ten differential behaviors distributed across five behavioral categories were identified. Between infant-rearing and non-rearing depressed subjects, nine behaviors distributed across five behavioral categories were identified. Between infant-rearing healthy and infant-rearing depressed subjects, fifteen behaviors distributed across six behavioral categories were identified.Infant-rearing depressed adult female Macaca fascicularis subjects may have a worse psychological status as compared to non-rearing depressed counterparts. Infant rearing may negatively influence depressed Macaca fascicularis mothers. Infant-rearing depressed subjects were less adequate at raising infants as compared to infant-rearing healthy subjects. Thus, maternal depression in this macaque species may negatively impact infatile development, which is consistent with previous findings in humans.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599092","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.672245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.56468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.552919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.512631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.393729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.383484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.349299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Quantitative property","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_property"},{"name":"Macaque","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque"},{"name":"Maternal bond","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Video","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"},{"name":"Consistency","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"},{"name":"Crab-eating macaque","weight":0.0329831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab-eating_macaque"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Rhythm","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm"},{"name":"560","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/560"},{"name":"1007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1007"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Enclosure","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure"},{"name":"Animal husbandry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry"},{"name":"Fire lookout","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_lookout"},{"name":"Differential equation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"},{"name":"Footage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footage"},{"name":"Political freedom","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"}]}
