{"id":88521,"title":"CT findings in temporal bone osteoradionecrosis.","abstract":"The goal of this study was to describe computed tomographic findings in patients with clinically proven temporal bone (TB) osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (TB-ORN).Computed tomographic scans of 20 patients were retrospectively evaluated for bony and soft tissue abnormalities. Clinical severity was graded based on level of therapy administered: mild (observation), moderate (antibiotics/hyperbaric oxygen), or severe (surgery).Radiation dose to the primary tumor ranged from 30 to 75.6 Gy. Time to onset of ORN from completion of radiation therapy was 2 to 22 years (median, 7 years).exposed bone, 20 of the 20 patients; otorrhea, 17 of the 20 patients; hearing loss, 11 of the 20 patients; otalgia, 10 of the 20 patients; facial nerve paralysis, 2 of the 20 patients; gait imbalance, 2 of the 20 patients. Computed tomographic findings: external auditory canal erosions, 18 of the 20 patients; mastoid effusion, 18 of the 20 patients; mastoid bony coalescence, 5 of the 20 patients; enhancing soft tissue, 6 of the 20 patients; soft tissue gas, 6 of the 20 patients; temporomandibular joint/condylar erosion, 3 of the 20 patients.Three patients developed an abscess.Mastoid effusion and external auditory canal erosions are commonly seen with TB-ORN. Clinically moderate or severe cases of TB-ORN are more likely to demonstrate enhancing soft tissue (P = 0.002), soft tissue gas (P = 0.002), and temporomandibular joint involvement (P = 0.07).","date":"2014-09-17","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24834883","annotations":[{"name":"Facial nerve","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve"},{"name":"Radiation therapy","weight":0.840851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy"},{"name":"Otalgia","weight":0.809243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otalgia"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.797668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Abscess","weight":0.787992,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscess"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.76942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.707697,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.666625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.645101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.642344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Ear canal","weight":0.641005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.591559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Facial nerve paralysis","weight":0.57551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_nerve_paralysis"},{"name":"Temporal bone","weight":0.525444,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone"},{"name":"Soft tissue","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_tissue"},{"name":"Otorrhea","weight":0.421659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otorrhea"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.248859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Mastoid process","weight":0.206147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_process"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.151817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Cutaneous conditions","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_conditions"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Temporal lobe","weight":0.101853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0704744,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Auditory system","weight":0.0579357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Time (magazine)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Gas","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas"},{"name":"Canal","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal"},{"name":"Gait","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"},{"name":"Primary tumor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_tumor"},{"name":"Erosion","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"}]}
