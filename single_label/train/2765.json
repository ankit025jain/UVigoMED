{"id":2765,"title":"Botulinum toxin injection into the lacrimal gland for treatment of proximal nasolacrimal duct obstructions in children.","abstract":"The authors retrospectively evaluated the use of botulinum toxin injections to treat epiphora in children secondary to proximal obstruction of the nasolacrimal drainage system. Three patients (ages 8, 9, and 16 years) received botulinum toxin injections in the palpebral portion of the lacrimal gland. Two patients experienced symptomatic relief immediately following botulinum toxin injection. Both required subsequent injections, with an average symptomatic relief lasting 7 months. The only noted side effect was papillary conjunctivitis in one patient that resolved without treatment. The third patient was lost to follow-up. Although conjunctival dacryocystorhinostomy with Jones tube is the surgical procedure of choice for treating proximal lacrimal system obstruction, complication rates in children are high. Botulinum toxin injections provide a safe and effective alternative.","date":"2014-11-27","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25427340","annotations":[{"name":"Nasolacrimal duct","weight":0.898993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasolacrimal_duct"},{"name":"Lacrimal gland","weight":0.893239,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_gland"},{"name":"Conjunctivitis","weight":0.850337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis"},{"name":"Eyelid","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.695321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Lacrimal apparatus","weight":0.624102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_apparatus"},{"name":"Epiphora (medicine)","weight":0.611152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphora_(medicine)"},{"name":"Conjunctiva","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctiva"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.555146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dacryocystorhinostomy","weight":0.526686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacryocystorhinostomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.503867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Botulinum toxin","weight":0.397222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.392673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Gland","weight":0.381224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland"},{"name":"Toxin","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.229746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Botulism","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.0190542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Drainage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Eustachian tube","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube"},{"name":"Bowel obstruction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel_obstruction"},{"name":"Relief","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"},{"name":"Duct (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Sewage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage"},{"name":"Lacrimal bone","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_bone"},{"name":"Papilloma","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilloma"}]}
