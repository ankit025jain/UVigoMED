{"id":22821,"title":"Shigellemia in a post renal transplant patient: a case report and literature review.","abstract":"Shigellemia is a complication of shigellosis that occurs generally in malnourished children. In adults, shigellemia is usually seen in immunocompromised individuals. Here we report the first case of shigellemia in a renal transplant patient from India. The patient had history of diarrhea, which was treated symptomatically. Subsequently, the patient developed high-grade fever and blood culture was positive for Shigella flexneri. Recovery was uneventful after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. In a country like India with high prevalence of shigellosis, screening for Shigella in the pre-transplant period may minimize the morbidity and prolonged hospital stay associated with the complication of septicemia.
