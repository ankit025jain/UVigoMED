{"id":2192,"title":"Improvement in the nutritional status and clinical conditions of patients with liver failure using a liver diet combined with a branched chain amino acids-enriched elemental diet.","abstract":"This study was performed to evaluate any improvement in the nutritional state and clinical symptoms in patients with liver failure and advanced cirrhosis after consumption of a liver diet with restricted energy and protein, in combination with a branched chain amino acids (BCAA)-enriched elemental diet.A BCAA-enriched elemental diet, in combination with a liver diet, characterized by restricted energy and protein, was administered in divided meals to 20 patients with liver failure associated with ascites or hepatic encephalopathy for 4 weeks.The symptom of ascites abated as a result of increased total serum protein and albumin levels after the nutritional intervention in comparison with baseline levels. Ammonia levels were slightly increased without exacerbating hepatic encephalopathy, and the protein nutrition state consequently improved.Divided meals of a BCAA-enriched elemental diet combined with a liver diet improved the nutritional state and clinical symptoms of patients with liver failure.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25436302","annotations":[{"name":"Ascites","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites"},{"name":"Hepatic encephalopathy","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy"},{"name":"Cirrhosis","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"},{"name":"Ammonia","weight":0.821006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"},{"name":"Nutrition","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.774151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Liver failure","weight":0.724116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure"},{"name":"Encephalopathy","weight":0.721318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.5655,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.497689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.46082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.413243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.247966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Branched-chain amino acid","weight":0.0494293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branched-chain_amino_acid"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Chemical element","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"}]}
