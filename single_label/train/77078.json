{"id":77078,"title":"Overweight and obesity among women by economic stratum in urban India.","abstract":"Using data of the third round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2005-2006, this study examined the prevalence of overweight and obesity among women from different economic strata in urban India. The study used a separate wealth index for urban India constructed using principal components analysis (PCA). The result shows that prevalence of overweight and obesity is very high in urban areas, more noticeably among the non-poor households. Furthermore, overweight and obesity increase with age, education, and parity of women. The results of multinomial logistic regression show that non-poor women are about 2 and 3 times more at risk of being overweight and obese respectively. Marital status and media exposure are the other covariates associated positively with overweight and obesity. Thus, the growing demand which now appears before the Government or urban health planners is to address this rising urban epidemic with equal importance as given to other issues in the past.","date":"2014-05-22","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847596","annotations":[{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.713405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"India","weight":0.629401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.582719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.571804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Economy","weight":0.535489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.433735,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Wealth","weight":0.319468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.271631,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Government","weight":0.260731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"},{"name":"Epidemic","weight":0.233206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.181782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"},{"name":"Family","weight":0.124923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family"},{"name":"Demand (economics)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"},{"name":"Logistics","weight":0.0387783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"},{"name":"Urban planning","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"National Federation of State High School Associations","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_State_High_School_Associations"},{"name":"Multinomial logit","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logit"},{"name":"Principal component analysis","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"},{"name":"Logistic regression","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Marital status","weight":0.0269662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_status"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.0262143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Multinomial distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution"},{"name":"Time-varying covariate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-varying_covariate"},{"name":"Stratum","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"}]}
