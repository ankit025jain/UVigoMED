{"id":79170,"title":"Intratympanic gentamicin for Meniere's disease: short- and long-term follow-up of two regimens of treatment.","abstract":"(1) To compare the results of the 2 regimens of treatment at 2-year follow-up and (2) to evaluate the need and the efficacy of retreatment after the recurrence of vertigo attacks in a longer period of follow-up (using the Kaplan-Meier method of analysis).Retrospective chart review.Tertiary referral center.We analyzed 77 patients treated with intratympanic gentamicin (ITG). Thirty-five patients were treated with high-dose (HD) ITG (in total 6 injections, twice a day, repeated every 3 days) and 42 with low-dose (LD) ITG (1-2 injections). The results of treatment were evaluated in terms of functional level scale, control of vertigo, and hearing impairment.At 2-year follow-up, a similar percentage of vertigo control was obtained in the 2 groups; the incidence of hearing loss and posttreatment disequilibrium was significantly higher in patients treated with HD-ITG. The long-term follow-up showed a control of vertigo attacks with a single round of treatment in 71.4% of patients treated with HD-ITG and in 55% of those treated with LD-ITG. With repeated rounds, an effective control of vertigo could be achieved in 88.5% using a HD-ITG protocol and 97.7% using a LD-ITG protocol.LD-ITG allows obtaining good results in term of vertigo attacks associated with a limited occurrence of side effects. The long-term follow-up showed that LD-ITG needed repeated rounds more frequently than the HD-protocol. HD-ITG ran less risk of needing repeated rounds, but retreatment was ineffective in 40% of the cases requiring surgical therapy.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24477826","annotations":[{"name":"Vertigo","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.723778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.643556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.43898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.410689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gentamicin","weight":0.401208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.248859,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Tertiary","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Musical scale","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_scale"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Record chart","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart"},{"name":"Lactate dehydrogenase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"High-definition television","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Equilibrioception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"}]}
