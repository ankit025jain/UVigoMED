{"id":84505,"title":"[Empowerment and power: their relationship in the proces of caring for the chronically ill in primary care].","abstract":"The concepts of \"power\" and \"empowerment\" are used in various disciplines, both political and social. Now are these terms frequently in the field of health. Our goal is to know its meaning as a synonym of expressions: \"energy\", \"force\", \"domain\", \"vigour\", \"power\", \"capacity\", \"authority\" and \"control\", which have been always within our practice nurse's own lexicon. Semantically analyzing them will help us in the understanding of its nuance. The literature review facilitates their understanding and allows us to link these words within the management of care. In this way we can propose diagnoses, interventions and outcomes specifically related to these concepts, which will help us optimize the efficiency in the management of care plans. The purpose of various collective nurses from different institutions is that the person is able to not generate dependencies and have the option of choosing your own lifestyle according to their culture and environment, independently or with the help. Generate knowledge is to generate power. The person should be educated and informed, to be expert and active and taking action to help control and minimize the progression of your health problem chronic and its possible complications. We are in the process of reformulation of the health system, whether it is private or public, and is necessary to know the power of the various actors involved in the management of the care to us. Each of these main actors--person ill, family/caregiver or nurse--has to know what is his role in this process.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087309","annotations":[{"name":"Culture","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.716476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.682424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Politics","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"},{"name":"Authority","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.555119,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.542344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Expert","weight":0.500743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.465484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Synonym","weight":0.405455,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"},{"name":"Natural environment","weight":0.371845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment"},{"name":"Semantics","weight":0.355673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics"},{"name":"List of academic disciplines","weight":0.329746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.316419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.244882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Lexicon","weight":0.244307,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.23264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Power (philosophy)","weight":0.214783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Primary care","weight":0.176993,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care"},{"name":"Empowerment","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment"},{"name":"Nurse","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Collective","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective"},{"name":"Actor","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Private school","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Efficient energy use","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Emotional expression","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_expression"},{"name":"Health system","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Action theory (philosophy)","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_theory_(philosophy)"}]}
