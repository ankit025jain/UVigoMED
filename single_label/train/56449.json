{"id":56449,"title":"Recognising retinoblastoma: what health visitors need to know.","abstract":"Retinoblastoma is very rare, with between 40 and 50 cases in the UK each year. However, delays in diagnosis and treatment can lead to loss of vision or even death, while with prompt treatment the outcome is much more positive. This article aims to provide community practitioners with the correct information about retinoblastoma, ensuring that babies and young children with retinoblastoma are identified at the first sign of the disease and are referred promptly. The article will examine the signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma, consider treatment options, present a case study and explore the role of the health visitor.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683888","annotations":[{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.651766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.642761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.549851,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.549832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.407917,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.352099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Community","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Retinoblastoma","weight":0.0783118,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoblastoma"},{"name":"Vision loss","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_loss"},{"name":"Health visitor","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_visitor"},{"name":"Need to know","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Community development","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_development"}]}
