{"id":61107,"title":"[Efficacy and safety analysis of interferon combined with imatinib in treating chronic myeloid leukemia].","abstract":"Imatinib has been recognized as the frontline therapy drug in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), however, only limited patients could achieve complete molecular remission (CMR). Recent clinical and basic proofs indicated an improved treatment outcome by the combination of interferon and Imatinib. This study was purposed to evaluated systematically the efficacy and safety of interferon plus Imatinib in patients with CML. Data from relative clinical trials were from clinical trial of gov and Cochrane Collaboration. A comprehensive literature search was performed from data bases such as pubMed and EM. The results indicated that 7 clinical trials and 12 research papers met the criteria enrolled in study, included 697 cases in total. The combination group had higher complete cytogenetic remission (CCgR) rate than imatinib alone at 6 months (58% vs 42%; P = 0.0001) and 12 months (74% vs 68%; P = 0.004). The major molecular remission (MMR) rate was also higher in the combination group at 6 months (58% vs 34%; P = 0.0001) and 12 months (66% vs 47%; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, compared with single drug, the combination group had superior CMR rate at 6 months (13% vs 2%; P = 0.0002) and 12 months (14% vs 5%; P = 0.0009). The major adverse effects of combination therapy were rash, asthenia, edema and musculoskeletal events, and combination therapy was more prone to inducing neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and mild anemia. It is concluded that compared with Imatinib alone, the combination of interferon and Imatinib has better clinical efficacy in treating CML with earlier cytogenetic and molecular remission. It is also a safe therapy in spite of slightly weaker tolerance than single drug therapy.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762996","annotations":[{"name":"Imatinib","weight":0.899718,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.899068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia","weight":0.837082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"},{"name":"Weakness","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"},{"name":"Thrombocytopenia","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombocytopenia"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.825599,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.825112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Edema","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema"},{"name":"Interferon","weight":0.814657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Rash","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash"},{"name":"Human musculoskeletal system","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_musculoskeletal_system"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Drug tolerance","weight":0.71666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Remission (medicine)","weight":0.699705,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.653494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","weight":0.612701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacotherapy"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.503911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.491498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Combination therapy","weight":0.239189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy"},{"name":"PubMed","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed"},{"name":"Nucleotide","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Electron microscope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"MMR vaccine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
