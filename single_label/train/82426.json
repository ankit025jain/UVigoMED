{"id":82426,"title":"Left maxillary artery pseudoaneurysm: a rare and late postoperative complication after head and neck cancer treatment.","abstract":"We report a case of a 50-year-old man presented with pulsatile swelling in the left side of the face since 2 months and a continuous sinus discharge since 3 days. Three years earlier, he was operated for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the left lower alveolus and underwent surgical excision with myocutaneous flap reconstruction, followed by chemoradiotherapy. CT angiogram of the expansile swelling revealed pseudoaneurysm of third part of the left maxillary artery and treated by surgical intervention.
