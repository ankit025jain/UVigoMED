{"id":37361,"title":"Description of a new family with  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome: risk of  visual loss in patients bearing the R260W mutation.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to describe a family with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) in which the disease was unveiled after the ophthalmologic evaluation.Family and personal histories from each of the patients were recorded. Each underwent a full ophthalmological examination along with the physical examination. The mutational analysis of the NLRP3 gene was performed by means of direct sequencing.The proband was admitted during an episode of unilateral anterior uveitis. She had a history of recurrent red eye and had been suffering episodes of skin rash and arthralgia induced by cold since childhood. At examination, she showed a reticulated corneal mid-stroma. Her mother and her younger sister also suffered from relapsing episodes of skin rash and fever triggered by cold as well as flares of red eye. They had developed premature hearing loss. In both cases, opacities in the corneal mid-stroma were evidenced with a slit lamp. The genetic analysis detected the heterozygous germline p.R260W mutation in the NLRP3 gene in the three women, confirming the diagnosis of CAPS. Treatment with anakinra resulted in complete remission of flares.In this family, a structural NLRP3 mutation was associated with classic MuckleWells features of different degrees of severity. Interstitial keratitis with corneal opacification, usually ascribed to neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, was found. We underscore that ocular involvement in MuckleWells syndrome should be carefully assessed, since it can lead to visual impairment.","date":"2014-07-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and
