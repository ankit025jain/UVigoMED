{"id":23293,"title":"Advances in enteric disease vaccines: from innovation to implementation.","abstract":"The Seventh International Conference on Vaccines for Enteric Diseases Bangkok, Thailand, 6-8 November 2013 Hosting 222 participants from more than 25 countries, the Seventh International Conference on Vaccines for Enteric Diseases (VED 2013) displayed the considerable progress that has been made in recent years towards unraveling the burden and etiology of enteric infections, alongside advances in the development, testing and implementation of vaccines that target them. The pervasive nature of enteric diseases, and the significant morbidity and mortality they account for, underscore the substantial public health benefits achievable through the use of enteric vaccines. A number of key talking points raised during the conference are discussed here, including early experiences with the use of double-mutant heat-labile enterotoxin as an antigen and adjuvant, progress and challenges associated with the implementation of oral cholera vaccines, and the issue of impaired rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity in lower-income countries.
