{"id":43491,"title":"The effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on physical fitness and morbidity in rectal cancer surgery patients.","abstract":"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) followed by surgery for resectable locally advanced rectal cancer improves outcome compared with surgery alone. Our primary hypothesis was that NACRT impairs objectively-measured physical fitness. We also wished to explore the relationship between fitness and postoperative outcome.In an observational study, we prospectively studied 27 consecutive patients, of whom 25 undertook cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) 2 weeks before and 7 weeks after standardized NACRT, then underwent surgery. In-hospital post-operative morbidity and mortality were recorded. Patients were followed up to 1 year for mortality. Data was analysed blind to clinical details. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis defined the predictive value of CPET for in-hospital morbidity at day 5.Oxygen uptake ( [Formula: see text] in ml kg(-1) min(-1)) at estimated lactate threshold (?ˆL) and at peak exercise ( [Formula: see text] at peak in ml kg(-1) min(-1)) both significantly decreased post-NACRT: [Formula: see text] at ?ˆL 12.1 (pre-NACRT) vs. 10.6 (post-NACRT), p < 0.001 (95%CI -1.7, -1.2); [Formula: see text] at peak 18.1 vs. 16.7, p < 0.001 (95%CI -3.1, -1.0). Optimal [Formula: see text] at ?ˆL and peak pre-NACRT for predicting postoperative morbidity were 12.0 and 18.1 ( [Formula: see text] at ?ˆL - AUC = 0.71, 77% sensitive and 75% specific; [Formula: see text] at peak - AUC = 0.75, 78% sensitive and 76% specific). Optimal [Formula: see text] at ?ˆL and peak post-NACRT for predicting postoperative morbidity were 10.7 and 16.7 ( [Formula: see text] at ?ˆL - AUC = 0.72, 77% sensitive and 83% specific; [Formula: see text] at peak - AUC = 0.80, 85% sensitive and 83% specific).NACRT before major rectal cancer surgery significantly decreased physical fitness as assessed by CPET.","date":"2014-12-02","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784775","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Hypothesis","weight":0.775547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.717789,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.704197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.688483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.532146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Lactic acid","weight":0.403549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid"},{"name":"Morbidity","weight":0.39615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbidity"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.319897,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.318273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Kilogram","weight":0.281115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.244282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Physical fitness","weight":0.192612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.1313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0341625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Lactate threshold","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_threshold"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Neoadjuvant therapy","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoadjuvant_therapy"},{"name":"Blindness","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Action potential","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential"},{"name":"Major","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major"},{"name":"Summit (topography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(topography)"},{"name":"Sound recording and reproduction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Mac OS X Snow Leopard","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard"}]}
