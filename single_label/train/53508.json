{"id":53508,"title":"MicroRNA-200c inhibits apoptosis in pituitary adenoma cells by targeting the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.","abstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators that are involved in the development of different types of tumors. MicroRNA-200c (miR-200c) has been characterized as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in different cancers. However, the role of miR-200c in pituitary tumorigenesis remains unknown. We observed that miR-200c was overexpressed in pituitary adenoma cell lines. We transfected a miR-200c inhibitor into pituitary adenoma cells (MMQ cell line) to inhibit miR-200c expression and found that the percentage of apoptotic MMQ cells increased. Using bioinformatics analyses, we predicted that the tumor suppressor gene PTEN was targeted by miR-200c, and we confirmed the presence of a functional miR-200c binding site in the 3'-UTR of PTEN using luciferase reporter assays. We determined that the inhibition of miR-200c expression can upregulate PTEN expression and decrease the expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt). Furthermore, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of PTEN abrogated the effect of inhibiting miR-200c expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-200c regulates pituitary tumor formation through the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, we propose that the inhibition of miR-200c could have therapeutic potential in pituitary adenoma.","date":"2014-02-11","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512727","annotations":[{"name":"Luciferase","weight":0.951721,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase"},{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.899002,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.848895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.802668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Transfection","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection"},{"name":"Oncogene","weight":0.800515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncogene"},{"name":"Phosphorylation","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"PTEN (gene)","weight":0.754106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTEN_(gene)"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.736679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.713026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.683726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"AKT","weight":0.678994,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.545974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.45888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Epistasis","weight":0.443471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.298019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.229985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Pituitary gland","weight":0.204137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland"},{"name":"Pituitary adenoma","weight":0.146367,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_adenoma"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Untranslated region","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untranslated_region"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"}]}
