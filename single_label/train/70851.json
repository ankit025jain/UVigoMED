{"id":70851,"title":"Judging pathological assessment in cancer specimens.","abstract":"The pathologist plays a critical role in the multidisciplinary team in charge of treating cancer patients, as many of the therapeutic decisions rely on the information conveyed through the pathology reports. The task of the pathologist includes not only an accurate assessment of pathological T and N categories, but also the evaluation of other indicators of prognosis including quality of surgery, margins of resection, as well as additional histopathological and molecular markers that influence prognosis and could predict response to therapy.","date":"2014-09-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132357","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.823712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.701318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.551693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.493124,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.396741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.0633182,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Multidisciplinarity","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinarity"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0532834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0149984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
