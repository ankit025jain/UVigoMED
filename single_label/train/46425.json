{"id":46425,"title":"Preoperative evaluation of venous anatomy in laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision for right colon cancer.","abstract":"This study evaluated the venous variations of the right colon using preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT), and to investigate its usefulness in laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (CME) for right colon cancer.3D-CT was performed prior to surgery in 81 consecutive patients with right colon cancer.Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed without conversion to open surgery in all cases (100 %). All 81 patients had a single ileocolic vein (ICV). The ICV flowed into the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) in 98 % of patients and the gastrocolic trunk (GCT) in 2 % of patients. The right colic vein (RCV) was absent in 6 % of patients. One RCV was present in 88 % of patients and two were present in 6 % of patients. The main RCV flowed into the GCT in 84 % of patients and the SMV in 10 % of patients. The superior RCV was present in 21 % of patients, and all cases flowed into the GCT. One middle colic vein (MCV) was present in 49 % of patients, two in 46 %, and three in 5 % of patients. The main MCV flowed into the SMV in 68 % of patients, GCT in 20 %, jejunal vein in 6 %, inferior mesenteric vein in 5 %, and the splenic vein in 1 % of patients. The GCT was present in 88 % of patients.Although the venous tributaries of the right colon are variable, preoperative 3D-CT is informative and helpful for surgeons performing laparoscopic CME for right colon cancer.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633663","annotations":[{"name":"Superior mesenteric vein","weight":0.89756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_mesenteric_vein"},{"name":"Splenic vein","weight":0.877494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenic_vein"},{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Inferior mesenteric vein","weight":0.779691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_mesenteric_vein"},{"name":"Ileocolic artery","weight":0.743443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileocolic_artery"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.737189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Jejunum","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"},{"name":"Spleen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.689003,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Mesentery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.665194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.659278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Colectomy","weight":0.657154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectomy"},{"name":"Middle colic artery","weight":0.517222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_colic_artery"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.242407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Right colic artery","weight":0.220804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_colic_artery"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.195183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Horse colic","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_colic"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Tomography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomography"}]}
