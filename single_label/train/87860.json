{"id":87860,"title":"[Surgical treatment of ulnar lateral mass fractures of distal radius].","abstract":"To investigate the type and corresponding operation methods of ulnar lateral mass in distal radial fractures.From January 2004 to September 2010,32 cases of distal radial fractures with ulnar lateral mass were treated by surgical incision and relocate ulnar lateral mass,including 23 males and 9 females with an average age of (34 +/- 9) years old ranging from 28 to 65 years old. According to the classification of Melone-Doi, 2 cases with type I, 24 cases of type II, 6 cases with type III. The operative appoach involved palm-radial, palm-ulnar, radial-dorsal. Among them, 28 patients with closed fractures were fixed with plate, 4 cases (including 2 cases of open fractures) were fixed by Kirschner pin and braces.Thirty-two patients were followed up for 8 to 18 months with an average of 12 months. All fractures were healing without complications. According to modified Gartland-Werley scoring system (GWSS), the total score was 1.12 +/- 0.45, the remain deformity was 0, subjective evaluation was 0.50 +/- 0.30, objective evaluation was 0.30 +/- 0.21, complications was 0.40 +/- 0.09; the result was excellent in 21 cases, good in 11 cases.The location of ulnar lateral mass in distal radial fractures is one of the important prognostic factors in wrist function and surgical treatment is an effective method of fixing ulnar lateral mass in distal radial fractures.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974433","annotations":[{"name":"Bone fracture","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Wrist","weight":0.674364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.628777,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.475058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.422715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.411507,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.297271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Deformity","weight":0.136506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformity"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.0539958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0446142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0422207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Skeletal striated muscle","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"Professional wrestling","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Hymenotomy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenotomy"},{"name":"Marc Kirschner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Kirschner"},{"name":"Codec listening test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec_listening_test"},{"name":"Interferon type III","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_III"},{"name":"Effective method","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Type species","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Lower extremity of radius","weight":0.0146694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_extremity_of_radius"}]}
