{"id":83199,"title":"[Fatty tumors of the jaws].","abstract":"Intraosseous lipoma is a benign tumor of the bone. It is mostly seen in the metaphyses of the long bones and calcaneus. There are few documented cases of intraosseous lipomas in the jaw. Clinically, the lesion is usually silent and radiologically it appears as a radiolucent area rarely including some radio-opacities. Diagnosis is based on clinical, radiological and histopathological features. Surgical removal of the lesion is the recommended treatment.
