{"id":5097,"title":"[Surgical staging applications with antibiotic graft bone for the treatment of open calcaneal fractures].","abstract":"To discuss the effect of surgical staging and using craft bone with vancomycin for the treatment of calcaneal fractures.From January 2006 to December 2012,13 patients with open calcaneal fractures were treated including 9 males and 4 females with an average of 35.2 years old ranging from 23 to 66. All cases were emergency cases. According to Sanders classification of calcaneal fractures, 2 cases were type II, 7 cases were type III, 4 cases were type IV. According to Gustilo-Anderson soft tissue injury classification, 8 cases were type II, 2 cases were type III A, 2 cases were type III B, 1 case were type III C. Firstly a thorough debridement or VSD procedures were applied,secondly calcaneal fracture were treated with open reduction, plate fixation and bone graft complex with antibiotics. Based on clinical examination, radiographic evaluation, and American Foot and Ankle Surgery Society (AOFAS), ankle function were evaluated after operation.Open wounds were headed after dressing and repairing,, lateral calcaneal wound were healed during the first period. All patients were followed up for 6 to 36 months (means 14.5 months). Fracture healing time was 14 to 20 weeks (means 16.2 weeks). Last follow-up AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score was (80.0 +/- 7.4) ranging from 55 to 95.For patients with open fractures, through reasonable clinical evaluation, staging operation, using bone graft with antibiotics can reduce the incidence of postoperative wound infection and promote fracture healing.","date":"2014-10-23","categories":"Wounds and
