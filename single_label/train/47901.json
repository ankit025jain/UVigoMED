{"id":47901,"title":"Clinicopathological features of colon adenocarcinoma in Qazvin, Iran: a 16 year study.","abstract":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) was the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in Iran between 2000 and 2009, with adenocarcinoma (AC) as the most common histological type. Demographic, topographic and histological variables are important in the epidemiology and biology of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate clinicopathological features of colon adenocarcinomas in Qazvin, Iran.With a retrospective design, patient records of two pathology wards from March 1997 to March 2013 were studied with regard to anatomical location and histological classification. A broader anatomical grouping was also used including distal vs proximal regions and right sided vs left sided tumors. Data were analyzed using T-test and chi-square test.118 (50.9%) male and 114 (49.1%) female patients were included in the study. Mean age was 57.3Â±14.7 years, with 29.2% under 50 years. There was no significant gender difference for age at diagnosis. The rectum (56%) and sigmoid colon (25%) were the most frequent anatomical locations. Proximal cases accounted for 18.6% in males and 8.8% in females (p=0.02). AC was more prevalent than other usual types in younger patients. The proportion of proximal cancer was 1.7% in first eight years of the study period vs 12.1% in the second one (p=0.005). A similar trend was also seen in right sided colon cancers (p=0.018).Young people are also at risk for the cancer with poor prognosis. Screening programs and weight loss in obese individuals can reduce incidence and complications of CRC.","date":"2014-02-26","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24568524","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.838536,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Histology","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology"},{"name":"Rectum","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.794856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.783378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.706228,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.629658,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.599075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Biology","weight":0.554218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.522715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sigmoid colon","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.483167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.379276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Iran","weight":0.31224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.195874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.144818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.136304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"2000","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000"},{"name":"1997","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997"},{"name":"Topography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"},{"name":"Order of Australia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia"},{"name":"Gramophone record","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record"},{"name":"Youth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth"},{"name":"Design","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Demographics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
