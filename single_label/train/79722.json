{"id":79722,"title":"Susceptibility of five species members of the Korean Hyrcanus Group to Brugia malayi, and hybridization between B. malayi-susceptible and -refractory Anopheles sinensis strains.","abstract":"Five species members of the Korean Hyrcanus Group: Anopheles pullus, Anopheles sinensis, Anopheles kleini, Anopheles belenrae, and Anopheles lesteri were tested for susceptibility to Brugia malayi. They were allowed to feed artificially on blood containing B. malayi microfilariae and dissected 14 days after feeding. The susceptibility rates were 60%, 65%, 90%, 100% and 100% in An. pullus, An. sinensis, An. kleini, An. belenrae, and An. lesteri, respectively. As determined by levels of susceptibility, results indicated that An. pullus was a moderate potential vector, while An. sinensis, An. kleini, An. belenrae, and An. lesteri were high potential vectors, when compared with the 90-95% susceptibility rates of an efficient control vector, Ochlerotatus (=Aedes) togoi. An introgressive study of B. malayi-susceptible/-refractory genes was performed intensively by hybridization experiments between a high (Korean strain) and a low (Thailand strain) potential An. sinensis vectors. The susceptibility rates of F1-hybrids and backcross progenies were compared with parental stocks. The results indicated that the B. malayi-susceptible genes could be introgressed from a high to low potential An. sinensis vector by increasing the susceptibility rates from 0-5% in the parental stocks to 55% and 70% in F1-hybrids and backcross progenies, respectively. The increase of susceptibility rates related clearly to the increase of normal larval development in the thoracic muscles of F1-hybrids and backcross progenies.","date":"2014-06-30","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974643","annotations":[{"name":"Species","weight":0.811625,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Larva","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.509728,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.453623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.428393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anopheles","weight":0.394585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles"},{"name":"Thailand","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"},{"name":"Brugia malayi","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugia_malayi"},{"name":"Aedes","weight":0.26706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes"},{"name":"Strain (biology)","weight":0.258979,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_(biology)"},{"name":"Thorax","weight":0.208273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Introgression","weight":0.177158,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introgression"},{"name":"Backcrossing","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcrossing"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Ochlerotatus","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochlerotatus"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"South Korea","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"},{"name":"Experiments on Plant Hybridization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiments_on_Plant_Hybridization"},{"name":"Stocks","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stocks"},{"name":"John Hyrcanus","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hyrcanus"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Microfilaria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfilaria"},{"name":"Channel 5 (UK)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"F1 hybrid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_hybrid"},{"name":"Crustacean larvae","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean_larvae"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
