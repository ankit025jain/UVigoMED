{"id":62281,"title":"[A new multi-factor risk score system for predicting the outcome after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].","abstract":"The aim of this study was to develop and investigate the significance of a new multi-factor risk score system to predict the outcome of patients with hematological malignancies received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The impact of pre-, peri-, and post-transplant factors on the outcome including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), relapse and transplant-related mortality (TRM) after allo-HSCT were retrospectively analyzed in 122 patients with hematological malignancies at our center. A new risk score system based on the independent risk factors was established and tested. The results showed that absolute monocyte count at day 30 after transplantation (AMC-30, ? 536 cells/µl) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.313, 95% confidential interval (CI):0.156-0.63], WT1( ? 1.0%) (HR = 3.268, 95% CI:1.644-6.499), pre-transplant risk grouping (HR = 1.999, 95% CI = 0.993-4.023) were independent prognostic factors of OS and DFS. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the risk scoring system:group A (no risk factor; score 0), group B (1 risk factor; score 1) and group C (2-3 risk factors; score 2-3). OS at 5 years were 95.1% ± 3.4%, 62.9% ± 6.6% and 36.1% ± 9.6%, respectively (P < 0.0001). DFS at 5 years were 92.6% ± 4.9%, 60.4% ± 6.8% and 15.4% ± 7.1%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The akaike information criterion(AIC) value of the new score system for OS was 331, less than those of AMC-30, WT1, and pre-transplant risk group (346, 343, 346), AIC value for DFS and relapse were 378 and 231, both less than the three single elements(417, 397, 411 and 268, 238, 257). It is concluded that the risk scoring system based on AMC-30, WT1, pre-transplant risk grouping is more highly predictive for clinical outcomes of allo-HSCT than any one of the three single elements.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598663","annotations":[{"name":"Hematopoietic stem cell
