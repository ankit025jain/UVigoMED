{"id":85865,"title":"[Bacteriology in acute exacerbation in patients hospitalized frequently for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].","abstract":"To analyze the distribution of pathogens and bacterial drug resistance for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in patients hospitalized frequently for AECOPD versus those with infrequent admissions.A total of 172 patients admitted into Peking University Third Hospital for AECOPD from January 2007 to December 2008 were recruited. According to the frequency of AECOPD-related hospitalization during the previous year, they were divided into two groups of frequently hospitalized ( ? 2 hospitalizations due to AECOPD during the previous year) and infrequently hospitalized (<2 hospitalizations due to AECOPD during the previous year). The distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria were compared between two groups.At the time of acute exacerbation, the frequently hospitalized patients had significantly higher rates of non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria (18.8% (9/48) vs 4.8% (6/124), ?² = 6.756, P = 0.009), enterobacteriaceae (18.8% (9/48) vs 7.3% (9/124), ?² = 4.877, P = 0.027) versus those infrequently hospitalized ones. The frequently hospitalized patients had more multidrug resistant bacteria isolated from sputum versus those infrequently hospitalized ones (25.0% (12/48) than 8.1% (10/124), ?² = 8.898, P = 0.003).The distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria are associated with the frequency of AECOPD-related hospitalization during the previous year.","date":"2014-05-21","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844953","annotations":[{"name":"Enterobacteriaceae","weight":0.939766,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobacteriaceae"},{"name":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"Bacteriology","weight":0.86885,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriology"},{"name":"Fermentation (biochemistry)","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.799397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Drug resistance","weight":0.78105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance"},{"name":"Multiple drug resistance","weight":0.739806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.694284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Antibiotic resistance","weight":0.613139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.173615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_exacerbation_of_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"Beijing","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Third World","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World"}]}
