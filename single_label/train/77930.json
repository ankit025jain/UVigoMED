{"id":77930,"title":"Munchausen syndrome by proxy presenting as hearing loss.","abstract":"To review the diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a factitious disorder, in which symptoms are induced or feigned, usually in a child, by the caregiver. The involved caregiver seeks to gain attention or sympathy and often has a psychological need to maintain the sick role. We highlight the diagnostic difficulties and factors that may help with diagnosis in an otolaryngology setting.We present the case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy presenting with hearing loss in a five-year old boy, who was diagnosed eight years after his initial presentation. A literature review of Munchausen syndrome by proxy cases presenting with ENT symptoms is provided.Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a diagnosis that otolaryngologists should be aware of, particularly where recurrent or persistent illnesses in children, especially those involving otological symptoms, are refractory to the usual treatments.","date":"2014-06-21","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24849842","annotations":[{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Otolaryngology","weight":0.768088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.518412,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Munchausen syndrome","weight":0.516559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchausen_syndrome"},{"name":"Hearing impairment","weight":0.485619,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_impairment"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.395077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.363573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.254334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Caregiver","weight":0.241109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver"},{"name":"Otology","weight":0.219076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otology"},{"name":"Hearing (sense)","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_(sense)"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.0629772,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Factitious disorder","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factitious_disorder"},{"name":"Sick role","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_role"},{"name":"Literature review","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_review"},{"name":"Presentation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation"},{"name":"Sympathy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy"},{"name":"Attention seeking","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_seeking"},{"name":"Refractory","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory"}]}
