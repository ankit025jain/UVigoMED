{"id":53498,"title":"Severe hypoglycaemia and its association with psychological well-being in Australian adults with type 1 diabetes attending specialist tertiary clinics.","abstract":"To investigate severe hypoglycaemia (SH) in adults with type 1 diabetes and its associations with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH), clinical, psychological and socio-demographic factors.Attendees of three specialist diabetes clinics in Melbourne, Australia completed questions about frequency of SH in the past six months; impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (Gold score); and measures of general emotional well-being (WHO-5), diabetes-specific positive well-being (subscale of W-BQ28), diabetes-related distress (PAID) and fear of hypoglycaemia (HFS).Of 422 participants (mean ± SD age 37.5 ± 15.0 years; 54% women), 78 (18.5%) reported at least one SH event and 86 (20.5%) had IAH. SH and IAH frequencies were similar at all clinics. In total, 194 SH events were reported, with 10 people experiencing 40% of events. Compared with those without SH, participants with SH had longer diabetes duration, were younger at diabetes onset and more likely to have IAH (p<0.01). Those with SH had greater fear of hypoglycaemia and diabetes-related distress, poorer general emotional well-being, and lower diabetes-specific positive well-being, (p<0.01). There were no associations with age, gender, insulin regimen or HbA1c.This study has identified that SH and IAH in Australian adults with type 1 diabetes exist at similar levels to those reported in US and European research. SH was significantly associated with IAH and fear of hypoglycaemia. Assessment of hypoglycaemia, IAH and psychological well-being as part of a routine diabetes clinic visit was well accepted by attendees and enabled identification of those who may benefit from medical, educational or therapeutic interventions.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513121","annotations":[{"name":"Hypoglycemia","weight":0.799086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.772903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.722341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.720716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.694099,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.688855,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Australia","weight":0.673931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.662106,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.591177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Melbourne","weight":0.474497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.460846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.418173,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Fear","weight":0.334813,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.312673,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.242819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.174442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.166245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.13131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.113254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.0503012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Intervention (counseling)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervention_(counseling)"},{"name":"Europe","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"Syllable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable"},{"name":"Movable type","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Specialty (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Tertiary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education"},{"name":"Biometrics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics"}]}
