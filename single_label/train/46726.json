{"id":46726,"title":"Herbal supplement attenuation of cardiac fibrosis in rats with CCl?-induced liver cirrhosis.","abstract":"Previously we found carbon tetrachloride (CCl?) induced cirrhosis associated cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether further CCl? treatment would induce cardiac cell fibrosis. The cardiac tissues were analyzed by H&E. histological staining, Trichrome Masson staining and Western blotting. The results showed that the CCl?-treated-only group exhibits more trichrome staining, meaning that more fibrosis is present. Moreover, CCl? could further induce cardiac-fibrosis via TGF-?-p-Smad2/3-CTGF pathway. However, our data showed that the CCl?- indcued cardiac abnormalities were attenuated by Ocimum gratissimum extract (OGE) and silymarin co- treatments. In conclusion, our results indicated that the OGE and silymarin may be a potential traditional herb for the protection of cardiac tissues from the CCl4 induced cirrhosis associated cardiac fibrosis through modulating the TGF-? signaling pathway.
