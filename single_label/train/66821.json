{"id":66821,"title":"Preconditioning renoprotective effect of isoflurane in a rat model of virtual renal transplant.","abstract":"The development of warm-cold ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury of the kidney grafts is inevitable during renal transplantation. However, there is currently no definite renoprotective strategy available in the protection of the graft tissue. In the present study, we compared the renal protection of preconditioning isoflurane with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in a novel rat model of warm-cold renal IR injury.Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to receive inhaled isoflurane (1.5% for 2 h), NAC (1 g/kg, intra-arterial injection) or placebo before the induction of brief warm ischemia (10 min) followed by cold ischemia (45 min) periods. Plasma levels of creatinine and tissue inflammatory reaction in the kidney were analyzed 72 h after reperfusion.Elevated plasma level of creatinine and urea indicated the development of acute renal injury secondary to IR injury. The creatinine levels were reduced in animals pretreated with inhaled isoflurane and NAC, and the level was more significantly decreased in the isoflurane-treated group. Preconditioning with volatile isoflurane also significantly suppressed the tissue myeloperoxidase activity and expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase. Immunostaining confirmed that myeloperoxidase expression was most significantly attenuated in the glomerulus and peritubular capillaries of rats pre-exposed to isoflurane.We present the first study demonstrating that the administration of volatile isoflurane before induction of experimental warm-cold renal IR injury provides preconditioning renoprotective effect, which is superior to the treatment with NAC. The beneficial renoprotective effect of isoflurane is most likely mediated by attenuation of proinflammatory reaction in the injured kidney.","date":"2014-04-21","categories":"Male Urogenital
