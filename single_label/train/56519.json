{"id":56519,"title":"[Efficacy observation of acupuncture method of tonifying-qi and dredging-meridian for blepharospasm].","abstract":"To compare differences of therapeutic effect between acupuncture method of tonifying-qi and dredging-meridian and conventional acupuncture method.Seventy cases of blepharospasm were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 35 cases in each one. Cuanzhu (BL 2), Yuwei (Extra) through Yuyao (EX-HN 4), Xinming 1 (Extra), Sibai (ST 2) and Yintang (GV 29) were selected as main acupoints. The acupuncture method of tonifying-qi and dredging-meridian was applied in the observation group, which was an acupuncture manipulation that could achieve strong needling sensation of qi arrival combined with electric-impulse stimulation. The conventional acupuncture method was applied in the control group. The treatment was given once every other day, 10 times as a session for continuous three sessions in both groups. The severity of blepharospasm was compared before and after treatment in two groups and clinical therapeutic effect was assessed. Follow-up visit was performed after half a year to observe the recurrence rate.The cured and markedly effective rate was 77.1% (27/35) in the observation group, which was superior to 51.4% (18/35) in the control group (P < 0.05). Among cured and markedly effective patients in both groups, the recurrence rate was 20.0% (4/20) in the observation group, which was inferior to 54.5% (6/11) in the control group (P < 0.05) in the follow-up visit.The acupuncture method of tonifying-qi and dredging-meridian could effectively improve severity of blepharospasm, which has superior short-term and long-term effects to conventional acupuncture method.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24673052","annotations":[{"name":"Acupuncture","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.514275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Qi","weight":0.366729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.280424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Therapeutic effect","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_effect"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.240005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Acupuncture point","weight":0.227465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture_point"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.127142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stimulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"},{"name":"Yuyao","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuyao"},{"name":"Blepharospasm","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blepharospasm"},{"name":"Yintang","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yintang"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"1835","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1835"},{"name":"Seventy (Latter Day Saints)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)"},{"name":"Session musician","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_musician"},{"name":"Extra (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Curing (food preservation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"},{"name":"Sibay","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibay"}]}
