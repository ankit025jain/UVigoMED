{"id":73919,"title":"BRMS1 suppresses glioma progression by regulating invasion, migration and adhesion of glioma cells.","abstract":"Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) is a metastasis suppressor gene in several solid tumors. However, the expression and function of BRMS1 in glioma have not been reported. In this study, we investigated whether BRMS1 play a role in glioma pathogenesis. Using the tissue microarray technology, we found that BRMS1 expression is significantly decreased in glioma compared with tumor adjacent normal brain tissue (P<0.01, ?(2) test) and reduced BRMS1 staining is associated with WHO stages (P<0.05, ?(2) test). We also found that BRMS1 was significantly downregulated in glioma cell lines compared to normal human astrocytes (P<0.01, ?(2) test). Furthermore, we demonstrated that BRMS1 overexpression inhibited glioma cell invasion by suppressing uPA, NF-?B, MMP-2 expression and MMP-2 enzyme activity. Moreover, our data showed that overexpression of BRMS1 inhibited glioma cell migration and adhesion capacity compared with the control group through the Src-FAK pathway. Taken together, this study suggested that BRMS1 has a role in glioma development and progression by regulating invasion, migration and adhesion activities of cancer cells.","date":"2014-06-02","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879377","annotations":[{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Glioma","weight":0.837861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioma"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.822105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis suppressor","weight":0.811823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis_suppressor"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.804923,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Enzyme","weight":0.797676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme"},{"name":"Astrocyte","weight":0.785202,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"},{"name":"World Health Organization","weight":0.729566,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Human brain","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.711058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.663224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Pathogenesis","weight":0.65511,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.64932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.642385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.614351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"Downregulation and upregulation","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.561346,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.510973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.479743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.424868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.28911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Epistasis","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis"},{"name":"Enzyme activity","weight":0.270891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_activity"},{"name":"Urokinase","weight":0.26582,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urokinase"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.202966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"MMP2","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"}]}
