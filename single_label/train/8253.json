{"id":8253,"title":"A reversible functional sensory neuropathy model.","abstract":"Small-fiber neuropathy was induced in young adult mice by intraperitoneal injection of resiniferatoxin (RTX), a TRPV1 agonist. At day 7, RTX induced significant thermal and mechanical hypoalgesia. At day 28, mechanical and thermal nociception were restored. No nerve degeneration in skin was observed and unmyelinated nerve fiber morphology and density in sciatic nerve were unchanged. At day 7, substance P (SP) was largely depleted in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, although calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was only moderately depleted. Three weeks after, SP and CGRP expression was restored in DRG neurons. At the same time, CGRP expression remained low in intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENFs) whereas SP expression had improved. In summary, RTX induced in our model a transient neuropeptide depletion in sensory neurons without nerve degeneration. We think this model is valuable as it brings the opportunity to study functional nerve changes in the very early phase of small fiber neuropathy. Moreover, it may represent a useful tool to study the mechanisms of action of therapeutic strategies to prevent sensory neuropathy of various origins.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24792390","annotations":[{"name":"Substance P","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P"},{"name":"Sciatic nerve","weight":0.891218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatic_nerve"},{"name":"Nociception","weight":0.889807,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception"},{"name":"Dorsal root ganglion","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_root_ganglion"},{"name":"Neuropeptide","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide"},{"name":"TRPV1","weight":0.837494,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV1"},{"name":"Calcitonin","weight":0.824329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin"},{"name":"Agonist","weight":0.819111,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Peptide","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide"},{"name":"Neuron","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron"},{"name":"Nerve fiber","weight":0.72657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_fiber"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Sensory neuron","weight":0.70749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_neuron"},{"name":"Epidermis (skin)","weight":0.697339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis_(skin)"},{"name":"Myelin","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin"},{"name":"Sensory system","weight":0.665762,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_system"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.597618,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Ganglion","weight":0.581737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglion"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.563739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.552831,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.453845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"TRPV","weight":0.450248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRPV"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Posterior root of spinal nerve","weight":0.348569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_root_of_spinal_nerve"},{"name":"Intraperitoneal injection","weight":0.27411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraperitoneal_injection"},{"name":"Calcitonin gene-related peptide","weight":0.199345,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitonin_gene-related_peptide"},{"name":"Neurodegeneration","weight":0.131801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration"},{"name":"Resiniferatoxin","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resiniferatoxin"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.113674,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0362143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Dorsum (anatomy)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsum_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.0264652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Root","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root"},{"name":"Heat","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat"}]}
