{"id":50084,"title":"High-throughput mutation profiling improves diagnostic stratification of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas.","abstract":"Sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) harbors RET gene somatic mutations in up to 50 % of cases, and RAS family gene mutations occur in about 10 %. A timely and comprehensive characterization of molecular alterations is needed to improve MTC diagnostic stratification and design-tailored therapeutic approaches. Twenty surgically resected sporadic MTCs, previously analyzed for RET mutations by Sanger sequencing using DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, were investigated for intragenic mutations in 50 cancer-associated genes applying a multigene Ion AmpliSeq next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Thirteen (65 %) MTCs harbored a RET mutation; 10 were detected at both Sanger and NGS sequencing, while 3 undetected by Sanger were revealed by NGS. One of the 13 RET-mutated cases also showed an F354L germline mutation in STK11. Of the seven RET wild-type MTCs, four cases (57.1 %) harbored a RAS mutation: three in HRAS (all Q61R) and one in KRAS (G12R). The three remaining MTCs (15 %) resulted as wild-type for all the 50 cancer-related genes. Follow-up was available in all but one RET-mutated case. At the end of follow-up, 7 of 12 (58 %) RET-mutated patients had relapsed, while the 4 RAS-mutated MTC patients were disease-free. Two of the three patients with MTC wild-type for all 50 genes relapsed during the follow-up period. Detection of mutations by NGS has the potential to improve the diagnostic stratification of sporadic MTC.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828033","annotations":[{"name":"KRAS","weight":0.852349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS"},{"name":"HRAS","weight":0.835796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HRAS"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Germline","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","weight":0.791749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Germline mutation","weight":0.784606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline_mutation"},{"name":"Thyroid","weight":0.651273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"},{"name":"Wild type","weight":0.564559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type"},{"name":"Thyroid cancer","weight":0.553095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.549299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Ras subfamily","weight":0.459309,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_subfamily"},{"name":"Medullary thyroid cancer","weight":0.455647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_thyroid_cancer"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.414229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"RET proto-oncogene","weight":0.292192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RET_proto-oncogene"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.281725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.259066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Intron","weight":0.258068,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron"},{"name":"STK11","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STK11"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Harbor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor"},{"name":"National Geographic Society","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_Society"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"354","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/354"},{"name":"Toyota R engine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_R_engine"},{"name":"SIM Application Toolkit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_Application_Toolkit"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Comprehensive school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_school"},{"name":"Social stratification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"}]}
