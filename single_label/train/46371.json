{"id":46371,"title":"A rare cause of haemoptysis.","abstract":"A 59-year-old man was admitted with haemoptysis, several months after a car accident. A diagnostic work-up including laboratory testing, chest radiograph and bronchoscopy could not explain the haemoptysis. A pancreatic-pulmonary fistula was suspected by additional CT scan. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography confirmed the diagnosis, followed by surgical exploration and repair.
