{"id":69736,"title":"Phase I study of intravenously administered ATI-1123, a liposomal docetaxel formulation in patients with advanced solid tumors.","abstract":"ATI-1123 is a liposomal formulation of docetaxel and may be administered without the premedications and hypersensitivity reactions. This Phase I study examines the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and antitumor activity of ATI-1123.Patients with advanced solid malignancies received escalating doses of ATI-1123 intravenously over 1-h every 3 weeks. The dosing commenced using an accelerated titration design and was followed by a modified 3 + 3 Fibonacci schema to determine maximally tolerated dose (MTD). Plasma was analyzed for encapsulated/non-encapsulated docetaxel; PK analyses were performed using model independent method. Response was assessed using RECIST criteria.In total, 29 patients received doses ranging from 15 to 110 mg/m(2). At 110 mg/m(2), two of six patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities including grade 3 stomatitis and febrile neutropenia. The 90 mg/m(2) cohort was expanded to ten patients and identified as the MTD. The most common adverse events were fatigue, nausea, neutropenia, anemia, anorexia, and diarrhea. ATI-1123 exhibited linear and dose proportional PKs. One patient with lung cancer had confirmed partial response, and stable disease was observed in 75 % patients.ATI-1123 demonstrated an acceptable tolerability and favorable PK profile in patients with solid tumors. Our results provide support for Phase II trials to determine the antitumor activity of this drug.","date":"2014-11-21","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25304209","annotations":[{"name":"Docetaxel","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetaxel"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Anorexia (symptom)","weight":0.832947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_(symptom)"},{"name":"Stomatitis","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomatitis"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Diarrhea","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"},{"name":"Nausea","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea"},{"name":"Lung cancer","weight":0.771006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Anemia","weight":0.744987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Liposome","weight":0.710553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.704378,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Hypersensitivity","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.679206,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.666133,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Febrile neutropenia","weight":0.657436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febrile_neutropenia"},{"name":"Pharmacokinetics","weight":0.653324,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.618082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Titration","weight":0.615849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration"},{"name":"Coeliac disease","weight":0.5491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.541371,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_Evaluation_Criteria_in_Solid_Tumors"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"},{"name":"Stable isotope","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Leaf shape","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_shape"},{"name":"Grading (tumors)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_(tumors)"},{"name":"Formulation","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formulation"}]}
