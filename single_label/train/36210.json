{"id":36210,"title":"Severe mitral regurgitation after intracardiac repair of tetralogy of Fallot: a rare complication and management.","abstract":"Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with additional ventricular septal defect (VSD) forms a difficult surgical subset. Commonly, additional VSD is in the muscular septum and direct visualization may be difficult during surgical repair especially in arrested heart. Consequently, direct closure of these defects is performed based upon preoperative imaging and/or intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiogram. We hereby report an unforeseen occurrence of traumatic acute severe mitral regurgitation after TOF repair possibly during closure of additional muscular VSD. We discuss the possible mechanism of this unprecedented complication, which was promptly diagnosed and managed with good surgical outcomes.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591398","annotations":[{"name":"Tetralogy of Fallot","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot"},{"name":"Ventricular septal defect","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_septal_defect"},{"name":"Echocardiography","weight":0.807432,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography"},{"name":"Ventricle (heart)","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)"},{"name":"Interventricular septum","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum"},{"name":"Mitral valve","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve"},{"name":"Septum","weight":0.697719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.688978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Congenital heart defect","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.625048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.623958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.573737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.496062,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Regurgitation (digestion)","weight":0.388943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"},{"name":"Mitral regurgitation","weight":0.388648,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_regurgitation"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.318501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.289281,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Tetralogy","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Book of Revelation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation"},{"name":"Time-of-flight","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight"},{"name":"Intracardiac injection","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracardiac_injection"},{"name":"Mechanism (engineering)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(engineering)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"}]}
