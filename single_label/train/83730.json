{"id":83730,"title":"Imaging T-lymphocytes in inflammatory diseases: a nuclear medicine approach.","abstract":"Increasing interest and research efforts have been made in search of specific radiolabelled probes for imaging different immune cells (including T-lymphocytes) in inflammation and infection. This has led to early detection of lymphocyte infiltration, and the deepening of our understanding of pathogenesis of immune mediated diseases. In-vivo imaging of T-lymphocytes with radiolabelled specific probes may provide an important piece of information about inflammatory lesions, which could be very important to understand the molecular mechanism of action of any drug and/or their effect on the microenvironment of the immune system of the body. The present review focuses on radiolabelled T-lymphocytes and different monoclonal antibodies, peptides, cytokines, chemokine used for scintigraphic imaging of T-lymphocytes and their subsets.
