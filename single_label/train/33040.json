{"id":33040,"title":"Congenital defects of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon of the little finger.","abstract":"The cases of two patients, a four-year-old boy and an eight-year-old boy, who had been incapable of active flexion of the little finger since birth, are presented. They were capable of active flexion of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint, but not of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. They were diagnosed with a defect of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon of the little finger and underwent surgery. In both cases, the FDP tendon turned into fibrous tissue proximal to the palm and lost continuity on this side. Reconstruction was performed by making an end-to-side anastomosis of the residual proximal end of the FDP tendon to the FDP tendon of the ring finger in the palmar region. Although one patient required repeated surgery due to post-operative tendon adhesion, good outcomes were achieved, with both patients becoming capable of active flexion.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875514","annotations":[{"name":"Metacarpophalangeal joint","weight":0.828428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpophalangeal_joint"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.762925,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Flexion","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Flexor digitorum profundus muscle","weight":0.744072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_digitorum_profundus_muscle"},{"name":"Interphalangeal articulations of hand","weight":0.72645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphalangeal_articulations_of_hand"},{"name":"Ring finger","weight":0.698659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_finger"},{"name":"Finger","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger"},{"name":"Little finger","weight":0.690155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_finger"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.685769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.684401,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Tendon","weight":0.684112,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.682075,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Hand","weight":0.662352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand"},{"name":"Connective tissue","weight":0.640382,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.60146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.259623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Genetic disorder","weight":0.054746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder"},{"name":"Birth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth"},{"name":"Fiber","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber"},{"name":"Reconstruction Era of the United States","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era_of_the_United_States"},{"name":"Free Democratic Party of Switzerland","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland"},{"name":"Continuity (fiction)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_(fiction)"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Member of Parliament","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"},{"name":"Errors and residuals in statistics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics"},{"name":"Adhesion (medicine)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesion_(medicine)"},{"name":"Dual in-line package","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package"}]}
