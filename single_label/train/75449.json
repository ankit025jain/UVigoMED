{"id":75449,"title":"[Between neurology and psychiatry].","abstract":"In this review we will discuss the broad spectrum of possible relationships between the fields of neurology and psychiatry alongside weighing the pros and cons of each alternative relationship. This is in the hope that such discussions will allow an informed decision regarding the construction of future relations between these two areas. The possible connections between the areas are discussed in light of possible relationships that exist between the two groups in the mathematical world with reference to the proposed solutions to the psychophysical mind-body problem.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25095609","annotations":[{"name":"Spectrum","weight":0.724787,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.503792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"Mathematics","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.162801,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Psychiatry","weight":0.131006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry"},{"name":"Construction","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction"},{"name":"Psychophysics","weight":0.0179759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"National Basketball Association","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association"},{"name":"Confidence trick","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick"}]}
