{"id":68012,"title":"Minimally invasive management of retropubic bleeding and hematoma evacuation after a TVT Secur or mini-sling procedure.","abstract":"Retropubic hematomas may complicate up to 4.1% of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) procedures in the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence. Symptomatic or expanding hematomas often require intervention, usually accomplished through an abdominal incision.A 43-year-old woman underwent transvaginal management of venous bleeding and evacuation of a 1500-mL retropubic hematoma after a TVT Secur or \"mini-sling\" procedure.Significant bleeding can complicate even the least invasive surgical approach to treat stress urinary incontinence. Transvaginal evacuation of a symptomatic retropubic hematoma with instillation of a hemostatic agent may be a safe alternative to laparotomy in a hemodynamically stable patient.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24566219","annotations":[{"name":"Vagina","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"},{"name":"Urinary incontinence","weight":0.840303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence"},{"name":"Hematoma","weight":0.816729,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematoma"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.773426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Abdomen","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.717277,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.678454,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.672611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.600225,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.575092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.254042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Hemodynamics","weight":0.225165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics"},{"name":"Antihemorrhagic","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihemorrhagic"},{"name":"Alternative medicine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"1500","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"TVT Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVT_Records"},{"name":"Instillation abortion","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instillation_abortion"},{"name":"Symptomatic","weight":0.0153226,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 43","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_43"}]}
