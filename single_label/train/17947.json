{"id":17947,"title":"Use of time from fever onset improves the diagnostic accuracy of C-reactive protein in identifying bacterial infections.","abstract":"To determine whether the input of time from fever onset will change the accuracy of C-reactive protein (CRP) in diagnosing bacterial infections in febrile children.We performed a prospective observational study on febrile children presenting to the emergency department. The diagnostic performance of CRP at different time points from fever onset was compared using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.Among 373 patients included, 103 (28%) had bacterial infection. The optimal cut-off for CRP suggesting bacterial infection changed with time from fever onset: 6?mg/dL for >12-24?h of fever; 10.7 and 12.6?mg/dL at >24-48 and >48?h of fever, respectively. The input of time from fever onset improved the area under the ROC curve from 0.83 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.88) for CRP overall to 0.87 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.96) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.97) at >24-48 and >48?h of fever, respectively. Duration of fever mostly affected the ability of CRP to correctly rule out bacterial infections. CRP level of 2?mg/dL obtained at ?24?h of fever corresponds with a post-test probability for bacterial infection of 10%, whereas the same value obtained >24?h of fever reduces the risk to 2%.Clinicians should apply different CRP cut-off values depending on whether they are trying to rule in or rule out bacterial infection, but also depending on fever duration at the time of CRP testing.","date":"2014-10-14","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833793","annotations":[{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.758867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.733635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.717039,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.716811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.715295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.636874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.495417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.394889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.388867,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.271605,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.234498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.19276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Departments of France","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"C-reactive protein","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.0175845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"Republic of China","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"},{"name":"1224","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1224"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Canal 24 Horas","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_24_Horas"},{"name":"Syllable onset","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable_onset"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"}]}
