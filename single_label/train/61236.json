{"id":61236,"title":"Prognostic impact of microRNA-145 down-regulation in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.","abstract":"Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a highly aggressive tumor caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are closely involved in the development and progression of various tumors. Here we investigated the dysregulation of miRNAs in ATL and its clinical significance. Studies using miRNA arrays and subsequent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that, in the 9 ATL cell lines examined, 1 miRNA was consistently up-regulated, whereas another 3 were consistently down-regulated, compared with normal CD4-positive lymphocytes. Next, we analyzed the prognostic impact of these 4 miRNAs in patients with aggressive-type ATL (n = 40). Of the 4 dysregulated miRNAs selected, 3 (miR-130b higher expression, miR-145 lower expression, and miR-223 lower expression) were significantly associated with a worsened overall patient survival. We found that expressions of these 3 miRNAs were correlated with each other. To clarify which of the 3 had the most significant impact on overall survival, we performed a multivariate prognostic analysis that included these 3 miRNAs, and only miR-145 lower expression was selected as an independent risk factor (P = .0005). When overexpressed in an ATL cell line in vitro, miR-145 specifically inhibited tumor cell growth. In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-145 down-regulation provides a growth advantage in ATL and is highly associated with a worsened prognosis for patients with ALT. Hence, miR-145 may be a useful prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for ATL.
