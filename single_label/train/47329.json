{"id":47329,"title":"Association between polymorphisms in OAS2 and CD209 genes and predisposition to chronic hepatitis C in Russian population.","abstract":"Chronic hepatitis C is a severe liver disease caused by positive-strand RNA virus. Previously, we reported an association between seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four innate immunity genes (OAS2, OAS3, CD209, and TLR3) and human predisposition to tick-borne encephalitis, caused by a virus from the same Flaviviridae family, in a Russian population. Currently, genotype and allele frequencies for these SNPs were analyzed in 75 chronic hepatitis C patients and compared with the population control (269 Novosibirsk citizens). Data obtained suggest that the OAS2 rs1293762 and CD209 rs2287886 SNPs are associated with predisposition to chronic hepatitis C in Russian population.
