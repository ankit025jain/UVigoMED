{"id":89633,"title":"Diaphyseal femoral fractures in children treated with titanium elastic nail system.","abstract":"Femur fractures are common long bone injuries in children which account for less than 2% of all paediatric fractures. Although these fractures are dramatic and disabling injuries for the child and parent, the good part is that they unite rapidly with minimal complications if aligned well. Various methods have been used successfully to treat these fractures, but they differ in their stability and potential for complications. The aim of our study was to see the outcome of titanium elastic nailing system in diaphyseal femoral fracture in children. The study included total of 30 children's (19 boys and 11 girls) of diaphyseal femoral fracture treated with titanium elastic nailing system and they were followed up at 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The average duration of callus formation was 3.5 weeks with radiological union mean time of 9.5 weeks. Full weight bearing was possible in a mean time of 10 weeks. According to flynn's scoring criteria, excellent and good results were in 24 cases (80%) and 6 cases (20%) respectively. The nail irritation was present in 3 childrens and there was no post operative infection, physeal injury and implant failure. Titanium elastic nail is a safe and satisfactory mode of treatment and is relatively easy to perform in disphyseal fracture of femur in children. It avoids the chances of physeal injury, infection and offers rapid healing.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696924","annotations":[{"name":"Long bone","weight":0.872067,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_bone"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.864194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Bone","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Femoral fracture","weight":0.657159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_fracture"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.649832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.640172,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Weight-bearing","weight":0.344348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight-bearing"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.335411,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.330637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Titanium","weight":0.252069,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Diaphysis","weight":0.189319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphysis"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.18028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Nail (anatomy)","weight":0.0193966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Bearing (mechanical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)"},{"name":"Total chances","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_chances"},{"name":"Bond duration","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_duration"},{"name":"Formation (stratigraphy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(stratigraphy)"},{"name":"Mode (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)"},{"name":"Healing factor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing_factor"},{"name":"Trade union","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Irritation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritation"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"}]}
