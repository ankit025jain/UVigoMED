{"id":86634,"title":"Positive airway pressure in patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.","abstract":"We designed a prospective nonrandomized study aiming at assessing the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) after a new diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).Consecutive patients referred to coronary angiography underwent an overnight sleep study during their hospital stay. Among those with angiographically confirmed CAD and a new diagnosis of moderate or severe OSAS, we compared the 3-year major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event (MACCE)-free survival stratified by CPAP at discharge.Of 496 patients undergoing an overnight sleep study, 129 had angiographically confirmed CAD and presented with moderate or severe OSAS. The incidence of 3-year MACCE was significantly lower in the CPAP-treated group (n = 17) than in the untreated group (n = 112; 12 vs. 44%, P = 0.02). After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, CPAP was significantly associated with a decreased risk of MACCE [adjusted hazard ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.78, P = 0.02]. Among men, CPAP was associated with a significant 3-year risk reduction in MACCE (adjusted hazard ratio 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.87, P = 0.04), whereas no significant benefit of CPAP was seen in women (adjusted hazard ratio 2.1, 95% CI 0.10-41.6, P = 0.63). The statistical interaction between CPAP and sex trended to be significant (adjusted P for interaction = 0.10).In patients with OSAS and CAD, the initiation of CPAP is associated with a significant reduction in MACCE compared with patients left untreated.","date":"2014-04-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755667","annotations":[{"name":"Sleep apnea","weight":0.864833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.809423,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.787846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Coronary artery disease","weight":0.7441,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease"},{"name":"Polysomnography","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysomnography"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Obstructive sleep apnea","weight":0.676719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_sleep_apnea"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.630353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.62438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.620849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.59418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Apnea","weight":0.576351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea"},{"name":"Positive airway pressure","weight":0.549429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.434841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Obstructive lung disease","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructive_lung_disease"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Computer-aided design","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"},{"name":"Hazard ratio","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"1041","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1041"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Atmosphere of Earth","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"},{"name":"Discharge (hydrology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discharge_(hydrology)"},{"name":"112 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(band)"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Hazard","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard"},{"name":"Sex","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Social relation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation"}]}
