{"id":62137,"title":"Noncoding RNA-related polymorphisms in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia susceptibility.","abstract":"Evidence for an inherited genetic risk for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been provided in several studies. Most of them focused on coding regions. However, those regions represent only 1.5% of the entire genome. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), it has been suggested that the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is dysregulated, which suggests that they may have a role in ALL risk. Changes in miRNA function may occur through single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether polymorphisms in pre-miRNAs, and/or miRNA-processing genes, contribute to a predisposition for childhood ALL.In this study, we analyzed 118 SNPs in pre-miRNAs and miRNA-processing genes in 213 B-cell ALL patients and 387 controls.We found 11 SNPs significantly associated with ALL susceptibility. These included three SNPs present in miRNA genes (miR-612, miR-499, and miR-449b) and eight SNPs present in six miRNA biogenesis pathway genes (TNRC6B, DROSHA, DGCR8, EIF2C1, CNOT1, and CNOT6). Among the 118 SNPs analyzed, rs12803915 in mir-612 and rs3746444 in mir-499 exhibited a more significant association, with a P value <0.01.The results of this study indicate that SNP rs12803915 located in pre-mir-612, and SNP rs3746444 located in pre-mir-499, may represent novel markers of B-cell ALL susceptibility.","date":"2014-05-16","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618566","annotations":[{"name":"MicroRNA","weight":0.846737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA"},{"name":"Heredity","weight":0.841915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.813496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Single-nucleotide polymorphism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.787178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Genetics","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"},{"name":"Genome","weight":0.755953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"},{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.716711,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Noncoding DNA","weight":0.67656,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA"},{"name":"Metabolic pathway","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.471522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia","weight":0.244715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.21478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Genetic code","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.113019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Lymphoblast","weight":0.0230709,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoblast"},{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Susceptible individual","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptible_individual"},{"name":"Controlled NOT gate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate"},{"name":"5-HT2C receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Biogenesis","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenesis"},{"name":"Obshchina","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obshchina"},{"name":"Genetic predisposition","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition"},{"name":"London Buses route 118","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Buses_route_118"},{"name":"Function (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(biology)"},{"name":"6B (Fringe)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6B_(Fringe)"},{"name":"Pasha (protein)","weight":0.0141802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasha_(protein)"}]}
