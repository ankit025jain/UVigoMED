{"id":45201,"title":"Overexpression of integrin ?v correlates with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.","abstract":"Integrin ?v subunits are involved in tumour angiogenesis and tumour progression in various types of cancers. Clinical trials evaluating agents targeting integrin ?v are ongoing. Integrin ?v expression has been reported in several cancers in association with tumour progression or poor survival. However, no study has addressed the prognostic influence of integrin ?v expression on survival of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).Immunohistochemical staining of integrin ?v was performed in 198 CRC samples to evaluate its prognostic significance.High expression of integrin ?v was observed in 58.1% (115/189) of colorectal adenocarcinoma samples, while only in 11.5% (3/26) of tubular adenoma samples and in none of normal mucosa or hyperplastic polyp samples. It was more frequently found in female patients and less frequently observed in well differentiated tumours. The proportion of cases with high expression of integrin ?v showed an increasing trend with increased T stage (p=0.032), N stage (p=0.006) and TNM stage (p=0.001). Patients displaying exuberant expression of integrin ?v showed shorter overall survival (p=0.001) and disease-free survival (p=0.004). Elevated integrin ?v expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR: 2.04, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.56; p=0.013) and disease-free survival (HR: 2.19, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.13; p=0.015).Overexpression of integrin ?v is associated with advanced T and N stage and as an independent prognostic factor in CRC.","date":"2014-06-20","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24695839","annotations":[{"name":"Colorectal cancer","weight":0.858942,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer"},{"name":"Polyp","weight":0.847179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp"},{"name":"Angiogenesis","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis"},{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.769335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Adenocarcinoma","weight":0.757016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mucous membrane","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.709036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Colon (anatomy)","weight":0.694342,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.689672,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Colorectal polyp","weight":0.683796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_polyp"},{"name":"Adenoma","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma"},{"name":"Hyperplasia","weight":0.683448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.672005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.542761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.526216,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.500508,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.228312,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Amino acid","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"}]}
