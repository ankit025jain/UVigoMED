{"id":36142,"title":"Congenital and acquired umbilical hernias: examination and treatment.","abstract":"Many adults and children with painful swellings to the abdomen present to emergency departments (EDs) and are diagnosed with umbilical hernia. Some of these patients require urgent surgery because the hernia has become incarcerated or strangulated, while others can be discharged home safely. This article explains what an umbilical hernia is and what causes it, and discusses how the abdomen should be examined. The article also reviews potential management techniques in EDs and how nurse practitioners can explain the condition to the patients concerned.
