{"id":78938,"title":"Chimeras of Bet v 1 and Api g 1 reveal heterogeneous IgE responses in patients with birch pollen allergy.","abstract":"Characterization of IgE-binding epitopes of allergens and determination of their patient-specific relevance is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of allergy.We sought to assess the contribution of specific surface areas of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1.0101 to binding IgE of individual patients.Four distinct areas of Bet v 1 representing in total 81% of its surface were grafted onto the scaffold of its homolog, Api g 1.0101, to yield the chimeras Api-Bet-1 to Api-Bet-4. The chimeras were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. IgE binding of 64 sera from Bet v 1-sensitized subjects with birch pollen allergy was determined by using direct ELISA. Specificity was assessed by means of inhibition ELISA.rApi g 1.0101, Api-Bet-1, Api-Bet-2, Api-Bet-3, and Api-Bet-4 bound IgE from 44%, 89%, 80%, 78%, and 48% of the patients, respectively. By comparing the amount of IgE binding to the chimeras and to rApi g 1.0101, 81%, 70%, 75%, and 45% of the patients showed significantly enhanced IgE binding to Api-Bet-1, Api-Bet-2, Api-Bet-3, and Api-Bet-4, respectively. The minority (8%) of the sera revealed enhanced IgE binding exclusively to a single chimera, whereas 31% showed increased IgE binding to all 4 chimeras compared with rApi g 1.0101. The chimeras inhibited up to 70% of IgE binding to rBet v 1.0101, confirming the specific IgE recognition of the grafted regions.The Bet v 1-specific IgE response is polyclonal, and epitopes are spread across the entire Bet v 1 surface. Furthermore, the IgE recognition profile of Bet v 1 is highly patient specific.","date":"2014-08-06","categories":"Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24529686","annotations":[{"name":"Escherichia coli","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.881428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Allergen","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen"},{"name":"Immunoglobulin E","weight":0.750072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Pollen","weight":0.719171,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen"},{"name":"Homology (biology)","weight":0.708098,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology)"},{"name":"Epitope","weight":0.685087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope"},{"name":"Birch","weight":0.526543,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.522042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.371698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Chimera (genetics)","weight":0.321622,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.259972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.205818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","weight":0.120845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Grafting","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Polyclonal antibodies","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Escherichia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"},{"name":"Bet (letter)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet_(letter)"},{"name":"Api (mountain)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api_(mountain)"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Characterization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization"},{"name":"Minority group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group"},{"name":"Relevance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance"},{"name":"Protein purification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_purification"},{"name":"Specific surface area","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_surface_area"},{"name":"Uncial 0101","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_0101"}]}
