{"id":67144,"title":"ADAMTS-7 expression increases in the early stage of angiotensin II-induced renal injury in elderly mice.","abstract":"We investigated the recently described family of proteinases, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTs), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as inflammatory mediators in inflammatory kidney damage by studying ADAMTS-1, -4, and -7 and MMP-9 expression in elderly mouse kidneys after angiotensin II (Ang II) administration.Ang II (2.5 µg/kg/min) or norepinephrine (8.3 µg/kg/min) was subcutaneously infused in old mice. Renal injury was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, 24-h albuminuria, and immunohistochemistry to evaluate inflammatory cell markers. The mRNA and protein expression of ADAMTS-1, -4, and -7 and MMP-9 were determined using real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry 3 days after Ang II or norepinephrine administration.Elderly mice in the Ang II group developed hypertension and pathological kidney damage. The mRNA and protein levels of ADAMTS-7 in the Ang II group were 3.3 ± 1.1 (P = 0.019) and 1.6 ± 0.1 (P = 0.047) vs. 1.0 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.1 in the control group on day 3. In contrast, treatment with the hypertensive agent norepinephrine did not lead to obvious renal damage or an increase in renal ADAMTS-7 expression.Renal ADAMTS-7 expression was induced by Ang II in elderly mice. The overexpression of ADATMTS-7 might contribute to early inflammatory kidney damage associated with aging.","date":"2014-04-01","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642842","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.897973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Norepinephrine","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine"},{"name":"Western blot","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.802901,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Hypertension","weight":0.801611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.799476,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"White blood cell","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell"},{"name":"Kidney","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"},{"name":"Thrombospondin","weight":0.712028,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombospondin"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Renal failure","weight":0.688959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_failure"},{"name":"Matrix metalloproteinase","weight":0.683817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Extracellular matrix","weight":0.670183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.661234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.659933,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Angiotensin II","weight":0.639604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II"},{"name":"Nephropathy","weight":0.621248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephropathy"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Subcutaneous tissue","weight":0.596746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.525361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.504888,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.408055,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Angiotensin","weight":0.388047,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin"},{"name":"Albuminuria","weight":0.354849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuminuria"},{"name":"Staining","weight":0.269179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staining"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Metalloproteinase","weight":0.107895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloproteinase"},{"name":"Family (biology)","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"},{"name":"Lead","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"MMP9","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP9"},{"name":"Sequence motif","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif"},{"name":"Shamanism","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism"},{"name":"Western world","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0143213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"}]}
