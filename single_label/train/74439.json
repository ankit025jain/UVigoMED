{"id":74439,"title":"Association of zolpidem use and subsequent increased risk of epilepsy: a population-based, case-control study.","abstract":"To evaluate the impact of long-term zolpidem use on the subsequent risk of epilepsy.We used data from the National Health Insurance system of Taiwan to conduct a population-based case-control study. We identified 4,972 newly diagnosed epilepsy patients (ICD-9-CM code 345) for the period of 2005-2010 as cases. For each epilepsy case, 4 controls without a history of epilepsy were randomly selected from the rest of the population. Zolpidem was used as a predictor of epilepsy.Patients with epilepsy exhibited an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.70-2.03) and were, therefore, more strongly associated with zolpidem exposure than control patients were. The adjusted OR of epilepsy increased with the increase of mean zolpidem exposure (g/y). Compared with the OR of nonusers, the adjusted OR was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.44-1.86) for those who had taken < 1.0 g/y of zolpidem and 2.38 (95% CI, 2.06-2.74) for those who had taken ? 20.0 g/y of zolpidem. An adjusted OR of 3.55 (95% CI, 2.94-4.28) was noted to be associated with epilepsy when users had stopped taking the drug less than 7 days earlier. The estimated risk declined to an OR of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.47-1.78) when users had stopped taking the drug more than 90 days earlier.This population-based, retrospective case-control study revealed a possible increase in epilepsy risk with zolpidem use, at either typical or supratherapeutic doses. These findings might stimulate public interest in safety issues regarding zolpidem use.","date":"2014-11-06","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25373122","annotations":[{"name":"Taiwan","weight":0.777234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.455157,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Insurance","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"},{"name":"Health insurance","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.161645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.130838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"History","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Order of Canada","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Canada"},{"name":"Zolpidem","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolpidem"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.0287296,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0206987,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Code","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"},{"name":"972","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/972"},{"name":"345","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/345"},{"name":"944","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/944"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"702 (band)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/702_(band)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"National Health Service","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"},{"name":"List of Latin digraphs","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_digraphs"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Public interest","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest"},{"name":"Voluntary association","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association"},{"name":"National health insurance","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_health_insurance"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0127581,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"}]}
