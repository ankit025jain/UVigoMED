{"id":52223,"title":"Subcutaneous insulin therapy - end of the road after 80 years?","abstract":"Subcutaneous (SC) insulin therapy has been a mainstay of pharmacological diabetes management from the moment insulin was successfully developed as treatment. Insulin formulations have become more refined and less allergenic over time, and ancillary technologies such as injection devices and glucose measurement tools have evolved to the extent of permitting closed-loop therapy. However, investigations have continued exploring alternative routes of administration with the ultimate goal of implantable islet replacements, whether cell- or \"silicon\"-based. Progress on these lines of research, however, has been slow to present patients with viable options: alternative delivery routes have failed to deliver insulin reliably and with commercially viable efficiency, while beta cell transplantation continues to struggle with tissue availability and in vivo viability. In the meantime, SC insulin formulations have advanced for rapid- and long-acting formulations, to better meet typical insulin requirements across the day. Thus, SC insulin will likely remain a key technology for the foreseeable future in order to address the needs of an ever larger number of insulin-dependent patients with diabetes.
