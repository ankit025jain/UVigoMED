{"id":83420,"title":"Radiation exposure in fluoroscopy of the shoulder: a comparison between mini and conventional C-arm image intensifier.","abstract":"To compare the radiation exposure of the primary surgeon while using the conventional c-arm and mini c-arm fluoroscopy at the shoulderTwelve shoulders of six fresh cadavers were used to simulate this experimental study. Radiation exposure of the primary surgeon was measured at the head and neck region. The average radiation dose was measured using both the conventional c-arm and mini c-arm, then the findings were compared.Mean radiation energy of the conventional c-arm was significantly lower than the mini c-arm at 59.39 ± 1.43 kV and 70.58 ± 4.01 kV respectively (p < 0.001). Dose rates to which the primary surgeon was exposed from the conventional c-arm and the mini c-arm were 81.46 ± 30.37 ?Sv/hour and 87.54 ± 43.69 ?Sv/hour, respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.875).There is no difference in the level of radiation safety for the primary surgeon when using the conventional c-arm vs. the mini c-arm for a fluoroscopic-assisted shoulder procedure. Therefore, selection of the methodology should be based on equipment availability and clinical considerations.","date":"2014-11-04","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25365897","annotations":[{"name":"Fluoroscopy","weight":0.818531,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroscopy"},{"name":"Energy","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Absorbed dose","weight":0.45964,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.435984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Radioactive contamination","weight":0.388641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_contamination"},{"name":"Volt","weight":0.317849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.312234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Radiant energy","weight":0.20613,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy"},{"name":"Acute radiation syndrome","weight":0.204313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Image intensifier","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_intensifier"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.115849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.070554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Methodology","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology"},{"name":"Simulation","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.0273417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"875","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/875"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"Regions of France","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Experimental psychology","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer"},{"name":"Gaseous ionization detectors","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaseous_ionization_detectors"},{"name":"Shoulders","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulders"},{"name":"The Avengers (The O.C.)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(The_O.C.)"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"Intensifier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensifier"}]}
