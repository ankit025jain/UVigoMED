{"id":7108,"title":"Pycnogenol ameliorates depression-like behavior in repeated corticosterone-induced depression mice model.","abstract":"Oxidative stress is considered to be a mechanism of major depression. Pycnogenol (PYC) is a natural plant extract from the bark of Pinus pinaster Aiton and has potent antioxidant activities. We studied the ameliorative effect of PYC on depression-like behavior in chronic corticosterone- (CORT-) treated mice for 20 days. After the end of the CORT treatment period, PYC (0.2 mg/mL) was orally administered in normal drinking water. Depression-like behavior was investigated by the forced swimming test. Immobility time was significantly longer by CORT exposure. When the CORT-treated mice were supplemented with PYC, immobility time was significantly shortened. Our results indicate that orally administered PYC may serve to reduce CORT-induced stress by radical scavenging activity.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901001","annotations":[{"name":"Antioxidant","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"},{"name":"Oxidative stress","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.83005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Stress (biology)","weight":0.787287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"},{"name":"Radical (chemistry)","weight":0.7135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.610086,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.518451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.4935,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Proanthocyanidin","weight":0.469348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proanthocyanidin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.370331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Water","weight":0.32438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"},{"name":"Drinking water","weight":0.2929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Corticosterone","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosterone"},{"name":"Pine","weight":0.149845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.143971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Route of administration","weight":0.0415996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_administration"},{"name":"Potency (pharmacology)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)"},{"name":"Bark","weight":0.0367234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark"},{"name":"Scavenger","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger"},{"name":"Maritime Pine","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Pine"},{"name":"Behavioural despair test","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_despair_test"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Human swimming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_swimming"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Drinking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking"},{"name":"Cortistatin (neuropeptide)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortistatin_(neuropeptide)"},{"name":"Cucking stool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucking_stool"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_action"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"}]}
