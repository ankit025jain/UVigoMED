{"id":68976,"title":"Focal amplification of the androgen receptor gene in hormone-naive human prostate cancer.","abstract":"Androgen receptor (AR)-gene amplification, found in 20-30% of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa) is proposed to develop as a consequence of hormone-deprivation therapy and be a prime cause of treatment failure. Here we investigate AR-gene amplification in cancers before hormone deprivation therapy.A tissue microarray (TMA) series of 596 hormone-naive prostate cancers (HNPCas) was screened for chromosome X and AR-gene locus-specific copy number alterations using four-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation.Both high level gain in chromosome X (?4 fold; n=4, 0.7%) and locus-specific amplification of the AR-gene (n=6, 1%) were detected at low frequencies in HNPCa TMAs. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation mapping whole sections taken from the original HNPCa specimen blocks demonstrated that AR-gene amplifications exist in small foci of cells (? 600?nm, ?1% of tumour volume). Patients with AR gene-locus-specific copy number gains had poorer prostate cancer-specific survival.Small clonal foci of cancer containing high level gain of the androgen receptor (AR)-gene develop before hormone deprivation therapy. Their small size makes detection by TMA inefficient and suggests a higher prevalence than that reported herein. It is hypothesised that a large proportion of AR-amplified CRPCa could pre-date hormone deprivation therapy and that these patients would potentially benefit from early total androgen ablation.","date":"2014-03-19","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481405","annotations":[{"name":"Tissue microarray","weight":0.954722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_microarray"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Microarray","weight":0.808733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarray"},{"name":"Cloning","weight":0.804428,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.803461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hormone","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone"},{"name":"X chromosome","weight":0.767691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome"},{"name":"Chromosome","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome"},{"name":"Fluorescence","weight":0.750386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"In situ","weight":0.682468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"},{"name":"Hybrid (biology)","weight":0.52768,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"},{"name":"Androgen","weight":0.517819,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.478103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"In situ hybridization","weight":0.475955,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_hybridization"},{"name":"Protein folding","weight":0.399584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"},{"name":"Nanometre","weight":0.383838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Copy-number variation","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation"},{"name":"Ablation","weight":0.235327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.185256,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Amplifier","weight":0.179122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0455959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"}]}
