{"id":88053,"title":"[Investigation of mechanical properties of materials used for functional stabilization in pilon fractures].","abstract":"Existing methods of surgical treatment of the pilon fractures do not provide early functional rehabilitation of patients. The lack of confidence in secure fixation of fragments in significant quantity of patients causes necessity to apply a plaster immobilization during long time. While seeking possibilities of early functional treatment of the pilon fractures there was proposed a theory of \"functional stabilization\" (instead of \"artificial\", but necessary plaster immobilization), materials and technologies for its realization. For substantiating, from the biomechanical point of view, of expediency of a new materials (Softcost, Scotchcost) application the data about their physic-chemical properties were adduced, and in particular, there were studied the bowing values, depending on loading, and modules of elasticity of these materials.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923122","annotations":[{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.643316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Materials science","weight":0.640654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science"},{"name":"Theory","weight":0.615908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.61551,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.482755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Mechanical engineering","weight":0.45219,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.443034,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.435087,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mechanics","weight":0.376825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"},{"name":"Elasticity (physics)","weight":0.283838,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)"},{"name":"Plaster","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"String instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_instrument"},{"name":"Modularity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity"},{"name":"List of materials properties","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_materials_properties"},{"name":"Causality","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Narrative mode","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_mode"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0141339,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Mortar and pestle","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_and_pestle"}]}
