{"id":54329,"title":"Obese patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 undergoing gastric bypass in Roux-en-Y: analysis of results and its influence in complications.","abstract":"About 90% of type 2 diabetic patients are obese or overweight. The obvious clinical improvement observed with surgeries, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, has opened space for research by different factors than only weight loss, as responsible for the return to euglycemia and reduction of medication use.To evaluate the efficacy and safety of surgical treatment of diabetes in obese patients with BMI above 35 kg/m2 underwent to gastric bypass, for the control of diabetes, weight loss, improvement of laboratory findings and complications of diabetes.The protocol was implemented in three stages: initial, after losing 10% of weight, and after a year.Seventeen patients who have lost weight in 10% were included in the surgical protocol. From the total, 11.8% continued needing medication (p <0.001). The time for weight loss was a month with significant reduction in fasting glucose, HOMA-IR index, insulin, HbA1c, hemoglobin, AST, urea and C-peptide and there was no variation in hematocrit, albumin, ALT and creatinine. With a year of monitoring, the surgical group showed a significant difference in weight, BMI, blood glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, insulin and HOMA-IR. The percentage of patients with neuropathy (31.3%) was lower than the number of cases at baseline (52.9%) (p> 0.05).Gastric bypass with Roux-en-Y derivation is a safe procedure, with good results in control of diabetes type 2 in obese patients with BMI above 35 kg/m2.","date":"2014-01-27","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463899","annotations":[{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 2","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2"},{"name":"Hematocrit","weight":0.877358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematocrit"},{"name":"Body mass index","weight":0.863687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.846968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Urea","weight":0.835773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Insulin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"},{"name":"Glycated hemoglobin","weight":0.816571,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"},{"name":"Glucose","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose"},{"name":"Creatinine","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatinine"},{"name":"Albumin","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin"},{"name":"Fasting","weight":0.79024,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting"},{"name":"Weight loss","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"},{"name":"Peripheral neuropathy","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.780583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.74653,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Alanine transaminase","weight":0.736135,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Blood sugar","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Obesity","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"},{"name":"Gastric bypass surgery","weight":0.680314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Overweight","weight":0.677137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.670478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.631765,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Aspartate transaminase","weight":0.56472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.442436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.347095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.217418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Medical guideline","weight":0.201841,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline"},{"name":"Mutation","weight":0.179334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation"},{"name":"Glucose test","weight":0.157208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_test"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Weight","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Space","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"}]}
