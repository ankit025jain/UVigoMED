{"id":73253,"title":"Improving enrollment in clinical trials for adolescents with cancer.","abstract":"Overall cancer cure rates have risen over the last 30 years. Adolescent and young adult (AYA) oncology patients aged 15 to 39 have not shared in these successes as an age group, including those who fall into the younger age group of 15 to 19 years. The reasons for this deficit in survival improvement are manifold, but research has shown that an important factor is decreased enrollment in therapeutic clinical trials in this population versus younger patients. The paucity of adolescents treated in clinical trials is itself the result of several elements of the health care landscape in the United States. On the local level, these factors include referral patterns and facilities available; on the national level, related factors include the number of clinical trials available for this age group and health care provider education in the care of these patients. We examine the data available that have contributed to this deficit in the United States and offer broad strategies to address these shortcomings with the goal of improving outcomes in this underserved population.
