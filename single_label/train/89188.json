{"id":89188,"title":"Follow-up of a new arthroscopic technique for implantation of matrix-encapsulated autologous chondrocytes in the knee.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and sequential imaging follow-up results at a mean of 36 months after an arthroscopic technique for implantation of matrix-encapsulated autologous chondrocytes for the treatment of articular cartilage lesions on the femoral condyles.Ten patients underwent arthroscopic implantation of autologous chondrocytes seeded onto a bioabsorbable scaffold. The patients were evaluated clinically using a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, and Tegner scores. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-mapping and magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) evaluations were also performed. Second-look arthroscopic evaluation using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading classification was performed at 12 months.Compared with their preoperative values, at 36 months mean values ± standard deviation for the VAS scale for pain were 6.0 ± 1.5 to 0.3 ± 0.4. Improvement in clinical scores between preoperative values and 36-month follow-up values in subjective IKDC scores was 46.9 ± 18.5 to 77.2 ± 12.8; in Lysholm scores, it was 51.8 ± 25.1 to 87.9 ± 6.5, and in the Tegner activity scale it was 2.9 ± 1.7 to 5.9 ± 1.9. Mean T2 mapping and MOCART scores improved over time to 38.1 ± 4.4 ms and 72.5 ± 10, respectively. Mean ICRS score by second-look arthroscopy at 1 year was 10.4 ± 0.1.All clinical scores improved over time compared with the preoperative values. Clinical results are comparable with MRI T2 mapping and ICRS evaluations, suggesting that this arthroscopic technique for cell-based cartilage repair is efficacious and reproducible at a mean of 36 months of follow-up.Level IV, therapeutic case series.","date":"2014-05-27","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24746406","annotations":[{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.88861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Arthroscopy","weight":0.872679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Cartilage","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"},{"name":"Femur","weight":0.786433,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Knee","weight":0.735569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.699351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.671548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.643849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Autotransplantation","weight":0.62001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotransplantation"},{"name":"Standard deviation","weight":0.505063,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.412794,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.368006,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Chondrocyte","weight":0.360019,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocyte"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.322966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Visual analogue scale","weight":0.305246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_analogue_scale"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.133922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Magnetism","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.103779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Articular","weight":0.0522101,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articular"},{"name":"Reproducibility","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Millisecond","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"},{"name":"Resonance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance"},{"name":"Scaffolding","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding"},{"name":"Genetic linkage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"},{"name":"Visual perception","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception"}]}
