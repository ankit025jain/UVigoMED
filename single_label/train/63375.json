{"id":63375,"title":"[Significance of microRNA-16 and bcl-2 expression in T lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia and its relation with prognosis].","abstract":"To study the expression of miR-16 and bcl-2 in T lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-LBL/ALL) and its relationship to prognosis.70 cases of T-LBL/ALL with follow-up data were studied by using immunohistochemical EnVision method for CD1a, CD3, cCD3, CD7, CD10, CD20, CD23, CD34, CD43, CD45RO, CD99, TDT, MPO, bcl-2 and Ki-67. The expression levels of miR-16 were examined by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thirty cases of reactive lymph node were selected as control.Among the 70 cases of T-LBL/ALL, the percentages of tumor cells expression of TDT, CD99, CD3, CD7, CD10, CD34, CD1a, cCD3, bcl-2, CD45RO and CD43 were 94.3% (66/70), 94.3% (66/70), 68.6% (48/70), 92.9% (65/70), 32.9% (23/70), 24.3% (17/70), 40.0% (28/70), 51.4% (36/70), 34.3% (24/70), 37.1% (26/70), and 48.6% (34/70). Separately, while tumor cells expression of MPO, CD20 and CD23 was all negative. A figure of Ki-67 expression > 80% was found in 24 cases and ? 80% in 46 cases. The expression of miR-16 was up-regulated in T-LBL/ALL, and it was 5.07 times of the reactive lymph node(P = 0.001). The high expression group of miR-16 was significantly correlated with longer over survival (P = 0.041). The prognosis of negative bcl-2 group was better than bcl-2 positive one(P = 0.904). The relationship of miR-16 and bcl-2 was significant(P = 0.042,?(2) = 4.147). Survival multivariate COX proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that the low expression of miR-16 might be a independent poor prognosis factor (P = 0.049).While the high expression group of miR-16 has longer OS than that in low expression group. The prognosis of bcl-2 negative was better than bcl-2 positive. miR-16 may be a independent prognosis factor. The relationship of miR-16 and bcl-2 might suggested that gene regulation may be influenced by them.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic
