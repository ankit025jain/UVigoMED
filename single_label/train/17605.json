{"id":17605,"title":"Escherichia fergusonii.","abstract":"Escherichia fergusonii was introduced in the genus Escherichia almost 65 years later than Escherichia coli after which the genus was named. From then (1985) onwards mainly case reports on E. fergusonii associated with disease in individuals of veterinary or human origin have been reported and only very few more extensive studies became available. This has resulted in very fragmented knowledge on this organism. The aim of this manuscript is to give an overview of what is known on E. fergusonii today and to stimulate more research on this organism so that better insight can be obtained in the role that E. fergusonii plays in human and animal infections.
