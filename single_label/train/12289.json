{"id":12289,"title":"[Detection of anxiety and depression status of BALB/c asthmatic mice model].","abstract":"To detect the anxiety and depression status of BALB/c asthmatic model in mice.A total of 20 mice were randomly divided into asthma and control groups (n = 10 each). The animals were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin for asthmatic model. Phosphate buffer solution was used in the control group. The mice were challenged with increasing concentrations of methacholine aerosol and the airway resistance was measuring non-invasively by enhanced pause (Penh). And elevated plus maze test system and forced swim were employed to evaluate their anxiety and depression status. Then bronchoalveolar lavage cytology was detected for evaluating the airway inflammation.In both groups, Penh value increased with the rising concentration of methacholine. The Penh values of asthmatic mice exciting with normal saline and methacholine concentration of 0, 5 g/L were 0.43 ± 0.04, 0.41 ± 0.05 and 0.44 ± 0.04 versus 0.42 ± 0.03, 0.39 ± 0.03,0.43 ± 0.04 in control group. The difference had no statistical significance (P = 0.290,0.652,0.723). At the concentration of methacholine 10, 15, 20 g/L, the Penh values of asthmatic mice were 0.57 ± 0.03,0.85 ± 0.04, 1.57 ± 0.08 and they were significantly higher than those of control group (0.45 ± 0.08,0.57 ± 0.06,0.82 ± 0.09) (P = 0.001,0.000,0.000). Asthmatic mice in the elevated plus maze on a behavioral test and found that asthmatic mice open arm entries sum closed arm entries (OE+CE), percent of open arm/total entries (OE%) and percent of open arm/total time (OT%) was (18.3 ± 3.6) times, (22.2 ± 3.1)%, (16.7 ± 4.2)%. They were significantly lower than those of control group ((24.0 ± 2.9) times,(28.0 ± 3.4)%, (21.8 ± 4.6)%) (P = 0.001,0.001,0.019). Asthmatic mice swimming time was significantly higher than that of control group (147 ± 12) vs (133 ± 10) s (P = 0.010). The total number of cells and eosinophil ratio in asthma group was (10.0 ± 4.0)×10(5)/ml and (68.18 ± 3.76)%. And they were significantly larger than those of control group ((1.7 ± 0.4)× 10(5)/ml, (0.12 ± 0.07)%) (both P = 0.000).Asthmatic mice with concurrent anxiety and depression may be a model for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of asthma with anxiety and depression.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24534353","annotations":[{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.856556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Aerosol","weight":0.856192,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell biology","weight":0.780702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_biology"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.75749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.696422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.69413,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.591436,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.499973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Molecular biology","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology"},{"name":"Saline (medicine)","weight":0.470961,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.431438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.419348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Solution","weight":0.382358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.375316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.369624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Eosinophil granulocyte","weight":0.355612,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophil_granulocyte"},{"name":"Behavior","weight":0.28755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.221155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.176834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.137357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.136585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.0436208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Electrical resistance and conductance","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"},{"name":"Old English","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English"},{"name":"Arm","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Human swimming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_swimming"},{"name":"Swimming (sport)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Mathematical model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Solid","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid"}]}
