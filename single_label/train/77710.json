{"id":77710,"title":"Occupational upper airway disease: how work affects the nose.","abstract":"Chronic inflammation of the upper airways is common and can arbitrarily be divided into rhinitis and rhinosinusitis. Infection and allergy represent two well-characterized and most frequently diagnosed etiologies of upper airway inflammation. Persistent upper airway inflammation caused by agents inhaled in the work environment represents a diagnostic challenge in clinical practice, and its pathophysiology has been little studied. Occupational rhinitis is a recognized medical condition with diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. In contrast, only limited evidence is available about the relationship between work exposures and rhinosinusitis. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the available literature on occupational upper airway disease with a focus on pathophysiological mechanisms and with an emphasis on the current unmet needs in work-related upper airway disease.
