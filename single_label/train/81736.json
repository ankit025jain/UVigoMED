{"id":81736,"title":"Evaluation of sentinel node biopsy in oral carcinomas.","abstract":"It is still a matter of debate whether sentinel node biopsy might replace neck dissection in patients with clinically negative neck lymph nodes who suffer from oral squamous cell carcinoma. In 30 patients (26 male, 4 female, average age 59.4 years) with oral squamous cell carcinoma we performed ultrasound guided punction of the lymph nodes which were lymphoscintigraphically seen together with histopatological analysis of the dissected node. Sentinel lymph node was seen in 93% cases. By use of lymphoscintigraphy sentinel node was verified in 23 patients. Ultrasound guided punction showed presence of regional disease in 10% of cases, whereas sentinel biopsy revealed 23 of the converted necks. Histopathological findings were positive in 33% of our patients. The results of this study revealed that sentinel biopsy did not reveal 27% of the patients with positive neck histopathology. In conclusion, sentinel node biopsy should be performed in selective cases as in some localizations it is easier to perform neck dissection in comparison to the sentinel node biopsy.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24851630","annotations":[{"name":"Squamous-cell carcinoma","weight":0.882706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous-cell_carcinoma"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.870749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Sentinel lymph node","weight":0.83303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_lymph_node"},{"name":"Histopathology","weight":0.818037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology"},{"name":"Neck dissection","weight":0.808903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_dissection"},{"name":"Biopsy","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Squamous epithelial cell","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_epithelial_cell"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.713916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.655061,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.545489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.182633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.0775986,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Natural selection","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Debate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"}]}
