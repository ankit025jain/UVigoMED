{"id":67252,"title":"Dietary intake of trace elements, minerals, and vitamins of patients on chronic hemodialysis.","abstract":"We aimed to estimate dietary intakes of trace elements, minerals, and vitamins in hemodialysis patients (HDP) of three centers in one metropolitan and two urban areas of Italy.Daily dietary intake was assessed using a 3-day diet diary in 128 HDP.Mean daily intakes of trace elements were as follows: zinc, 7.6 ± 5.4 mg; copper, 14.3 ± 11.8 mg; selenium, 28.3 ± 18.1 ?g; and iron, 7.2 ± 4.1 mg (7.8 ± 2.6 mg in women, 6.9 ± 2.4 mg in men). The distribution of patients by daily intakes of trace elements showed most were under the recommended values, with the exception of copper intake, which was much higher. Mean daily intakes of minerals were as follows: magnesium, 174.4 ± 94.3 mg; phosphorus, 842.6 ± 576.8 mg; calcium, 371.8 ± 363.7 mg; potassium, 1,616.2 ± 897.3 mg; and sodium, 1,350 ± 1,281 mg. Mean daily intakes of vitamins were as follows: vitamin A, 486.1 ± 544.6 ?g; vitamin B1, 0.86 ± 0.7 mg; vitamin B2, 1.1 ± 0.7 mg; vitamin B3, 13.3 ± 8.1 mg; vitamin C, 47.8 ± 50.3 mg; and vitamin E, 9.5 ± 3.6 mg. The distribution of patients by daily intakes of vitamins showed most were under the recommended values. Daily intakes of trace elements and vitamins were similar among the three centers and did not differ between dialysis and non-dialysis days.Many HDP have daily dietary intakes of trace elements and vitamins below the recommended values, whereas the intake of copper is much higher.","date":"2014-03-31","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633699","annotations":[{"name":"Vitamin C","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C"},{"name":"Hemodialysis","weight":0.856854,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodialysis"},{"name":"Selenium","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium"},{"name":"Vitamin E","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E"},{"name":"Vitamin A","weight":0.838285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A"},{"name":"Magnesium","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"},{"name":"Phosphorus","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus"},{"name":"Zinc","weight":0.836593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"},{"name":"B vitamins","weight":0.815563,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins"},{"name":"Calcium","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"},{"name":"Copper","weight":0.813687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"},{"name":"Potassium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"},{"name":"Sodium","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"},{"name":"Vitamin","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin"},{"name":"Mineral","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.734358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Riboflavin","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"},{"name":"Thiamine","weight":0.720049,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"},{"name":"Iron","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"},{"name":"Niacin","weight":0.714797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niacin"},{"name":"Trace element","weight":0.667093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_element"},{"name":"Dialysis","weight":0.648218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.614906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Orders of magnitude (mass)","weight":0.613839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.589692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.170474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Printed circuit board","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board"},{"name":"Urban area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area"},{"name":"Intake","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake"},{"name":"Diary","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary"},{"name":"Poverty","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"}]}
