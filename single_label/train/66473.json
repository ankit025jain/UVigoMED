{"id":66473,"title":"5-Alpha reductase inhibitors in active surveillance.","abstract":"Active surveillance is now one of the recommended treatment options for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). However, about 10-30% of men on active surveillance will progress and require definitive therapy. In this review, we examine the role of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) in secondary prevention among men with low-risk PCa who opted to be managed by active surveillance.Three retrospective studies and one randomized controlled trial have evaluated the role of 5-ARIs in preventing clinical progression among men followed by active surveillance. These studies largely support the role of 5-ARIs for secondary chemoprevention, although the drugs do not have an indication for this setting.5-ARIs have been shown to play an important role in preventing clinical progression among men with low-risk PCa on active surveillance. However, in light of the US Food and Drug Administration recommendation against 5-ARIs for primary chemoprevention, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Patients should be made aware of this warning label before starting the drug.","date":"2014-04-09","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710052","annotations":[{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.892624,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Food and Drug Administration","weight":0.823443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.797998,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.683165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.562161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.395092,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Chemoprophylaxis","weight":0.336834,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoprophylaxis"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.309539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Light","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Alpha blocker","weight":0.042255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_blocker"},{"name":"Label","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Warning label","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_label"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Watchful waiting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchful_waiting"},{"name":"Reductase","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductase"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Play (theatre)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Secondary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0126606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
