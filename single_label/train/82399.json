{"id":82399,"title":"Anti-resorptive osteonecrosis of the jaws: facts forgotten, questions answered, lessons learned.","abstract":"Osteonecrosis of the jaws associated with bisphosphonate and other anti-resorptive medications (ARONJ) has historically been a poorly understood disease process in terms of its pathophysiology, prevention and treatment since it was originally described in 2003. In association with its original discovery 11Â years ago, non-evidence based speculation of these issues have been published in the international literature and are currently being challenged. A critical analysis of cancer patients with ARONJ, for example, reveals that their osteonecrosis is nearly identical to that of cancer patients who are naive to anti-resorptive medications. In addition, osteonecrosis of the jaws is not unique to patients exposed to anti-resorptive medications, but is also seen in patients with osteomyelitis and other pathologic processes of the jaws. This article represents a review of facts forgotten, questions answered, and lessons learned in general regarding osteonecrosis of the jaws.
