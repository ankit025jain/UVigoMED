{"id":83201,"title":"Static support in the facial palsy patient: a case series of 51 patients using tensor fascia lata slings as the sole treatment for correcting the position of the mouth.","abstract":"Although free functional muscle transfer (FFMT) remains the gold standard treatment of facial paralysis to produce a spontaneous, symmetrical smile in response to emotion, there are occasions when this option may not be available. Many patient factors and co-morbidities may result in a poor outcome, with flap and even patient survival being put at risk. The use of tensor facia lata (TFL) slings has been well described and provides a surgeon with a static option which yields acceptable results. We present the results of two surgeons experience using TFL sling as the sole treatment of facial paralysis and include complications, revision rates and outcomes. The results confirm that the use of a TFL sling equips the facial palsy surgeon with an excellent option for the cases where free functional muscle transfer is unavailable.","date":"2014-02-28","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412100","annotations":[{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.597488,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Bell's palsy","weight":0.355731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_palsy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.353863,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Paralysis","weight":0.345174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.270177,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Emotion","weight":0.247927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"},{"name":"Fascia","weight":0.241912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia"},{"name":"Comorbidity","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity"},{"name":"Surgeon","weight":0.155832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.129806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Gold","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"},{"name":"Symmetry","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"},{"name":"Gold standard (test)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard_(test)"},{"name":"Tensor fasciae latae muscle","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_fasciae_latae_muscle"},{"name":"Fascia lata","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia_lata"},{"name":"Constitution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Sling (weapon)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_(weapon)"},{"name":"Smile","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile"},{"name":"Bandage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandage"},{"name":"Fascia (car)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia_(car)"},{"name":"Static (DC Comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)"},{"name":"Standard treatment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_treatment"},{"name":"Free flap","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_flap"},{"name":"Intermittent energy source","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_energy_source"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Yield (wine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(wine)"},{"name":"Case series","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_series"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Tasmanian Football League","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Football_League"},{"name":"Tensor","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor"}]}
