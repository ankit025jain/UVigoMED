{"id":22540,"title":"[Effect of endotracheal intubation and laryngeal mask airway on perioperative respiratory adverse events in children with upper airway infections].","abstract":"To investigate the effect of endotracheal intubation (TT) or the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) on the incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events in children with upper respiratory tract infection undergo general anesthesia.From November, 2006 to October, 2012 in the Zhuji People's Hospital, 76 children with upper respiratory tract infection approved by hospital ethic committee were randomly divided into 2 groups:group I (n = 36), children were applied with endotracheal intubation during general anesthesia (TT group), while groupII (n = 40), laryngeal mask airway were used (LMA group).Intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP), hear rate (HR), pulse oximetry (SPO2), and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (P ETCO2) were recorded during the surgery. The incidence of adverse events such as hypoxemia, fidgety, sore throat, and laryngospasm were evaluated in resuscitation room.We also assessed the pre- and postoperative symptoms of respiratory tract infection.There was no significant difference in upper respiratory tract infection symptoms between two groups, and the children in both groups have good tolerance to TT or LMA.However, the hemodynamics status in LMA group were more stable than those in TT group after the LMA insertion or removing (P < 0.05). The incidence of hypoxemia, fidgety, sore throat, and laryngospasm were significant lower in LMA group compared with those in TT group (P < 0.05).LMA could decrease the incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events and can be safely used in children with upper respiratory tract infection undergo general anesthesia.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and
