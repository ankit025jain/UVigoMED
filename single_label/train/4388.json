{"id":4388,"title":"[Evaluation on implementation effect of Malaria Elimination Project supported by Global Fund in Shaanxi Province].","abstract":"To evaluate the implementation effect of Malaria Elimination Project supported by the Global Fund in Shaanxi Province so as to provide the evidence for the scientific implementation of Malaria Elimination Action Plan and the examination and evaluation work.The data of malaria prevention and control work were collected and analyzed statistically in 27 counties from 2010 to 2012 in order to evaluate the measures and effects of malaria control.There were 64 reported cases in the project areas from 2010 to 2012, and the average annual incidence rate was 0.15/10 million with a declining trend. The infected area sources of patients were mainly imported overseas accounting for 79.69% of the total cases. The blood completion rate of febrile patients was 94.14%, and the scope of the blood smears testing work had expanded to 88 counties (including 61 third-class counties). The training coverage rate of malaria prevention knowledge and skills had achieved to 100%. The awareness rates of malaria prevention and control were 91.68% and 89.44% in the students and local residents respectively. The case reporting within 24 h after diagnosed, epidemiological case study and outbreak disposal, laboratory testing and confirming and the other case management capabilities had also improved significantly.The implementation of the Global Fund Malaria Project in Shaanxi Province has accelerated the process of Malaria Elimination work and improved significantly the malaria control ability in the project areas.","date":"2014-10-27","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25345165","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.772383,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.657726,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.611976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.473576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.371522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.364692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.237222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.151404,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Accountancy","weight":0.147927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountancy"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.147269,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Animal testing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"},{"name":"Case study","weight":0.0544769,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.0537645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Outbreak","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Shaanxi","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0224498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Hour","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour"},{"name":"1979","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979"},{"name":"1510","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1510"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"County (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)"},{"name":"Smear campaign","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign"},{"name":"Blood film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_film"},{"name":"The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Global_Fund_to_Fight_AIDS,_Tuberculosis_and_Malaria"},{"name":"Malaria prophylaxis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_prophylaxis"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"Annual plant","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"},{"name":"List of California counties","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_California_counties"},{"name":"Global Television Network","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Television_Network"},{"name":"List of counties in Ohio","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Ohio"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"}]}
