{"id":19901,"title":"Pestalols A-E, new alkenyl phenol and benzaldehyde derivatives from endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis sp. AcBC2 isolated from the Chinese mangrove plant Aegiceras corniculatum.","abstract":"Five alkenyl phenol and benzaldehyde derivatives, pestalols A-E (1-5), as well as seven known compounds (6-12), were isolated from endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis sp. AcBC2 derived from the Chinese mangrove plant Aegiceras corniculatum. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 2 and 3 showed cytotoxicity against a panel of 10 tumor cell lines. Compounds 1-5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 showed inhibitory activities against Influenza A virus subtype (H3N2) and Swine Flu (H1N1) viruses. Compound 2 also showed inhibitory activity against tuberculosis.
