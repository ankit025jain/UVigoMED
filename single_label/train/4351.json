{"id":4351,"title":"[Investigation on knowledge of malaria prevention and control in residents of Suining County].","abstract":"To understand the status of knowledge of malaria prevention and control in residents of Suining County, so as to provide the reference for improving the implementation of malaria elimination.Nine villages in 3 townships (3 villages per township) were randomly selected as the study areas, and 200 residents aged above 15 years of each village were investigated with questionnaire for the knowledge of malaria prevention and control.The awareness rates of \"malaria transmission way\", main symptoms of malaria\", \"life-threatening of falciparum malaria\", \"how to treat malaria\", and \"how to prevent malaria\" were 96.27%, 95.01%, 81.46%, 98.19% and 96.27%, respectively. There were no significant differences between the different genders and among the different areas (all P >0.05), but there were significant differences among different age groups (all P <0.05).The awareness of malaria prevention and control in residents of Suining County is relatively high, which means the health education is effective.","date":"2014-12-01","categories":"Parasitic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434160","annotations":[{"name":"Malaria","weight":0.230556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.222557,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Village","weight":0.195936,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.168449,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.0401361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Township","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Township"},{"name":"Suining","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suining"},{"name":"Suining County, Jiangsu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suining_County,_Jiangsu"},{"name":"Health education","weight":0.028716,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Knowledge","weight":0.0186843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge"},{"name":"1998","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998"},{"name":"Electric power transmission","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"},{"name":"Defecation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Awareness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness"},{"name":"Malaria prophylaxis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_prophylaxis"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Plasmodium falciparum","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum"}]}
