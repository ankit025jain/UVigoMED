{"id":38104,"title":"Neurofibromatosis type I and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome: report of one case.","abstract":"Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) has been only rarely reported in association with anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). We report a 38 year-old female with NF1, who developed a cervix carcinoma at the age of 30 years and was successfully treated with conization, without requiring chemotherapy or radiation. She experienced two miscarriages prior to the diagnosis of the carcinoma. When she was 38 years old, an APS was diagnosed based on repeatedly positive lupus anticoagulant tests. The patient continued to smoke and using oral contraceptives. At 38 years of age she had a myocardial infarction, despite the use of oral anticoagulation. She required coronary stenting. Aspirin and clopidogrel were indicated thereafter.","date":"2014-01-22","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448865","annotations":[{"name":"Myocardial infarction","weight":0.950911,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis type I","weight":0.898537,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis_type_I"},{"name":"Anticoagulant","weight":0.89329,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticoagulant"},{"name":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","weight":0.823523,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_syndrome"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.808183,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Systemic lupus erythematosus","weight":0.772147,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.766295,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.734391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.715257,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Miscarriage","weight":0.684638,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"},{"name":"Neurofibromatosis","weight":0.683827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Infarction","weight":0.650591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction"},{"name":"Cardiac muscle","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_muscle"},{"name":"Cervical conization","weight":0.574081,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_conization"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Tobacco smoking","weight":0.555046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking"},{"name":"NF1","weight":0.489755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NF1"},{"name":"Type I and type II errors","weight":0.488934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"},{"name":"Clopidogrel","weight":0.439532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopidogrel"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.239066,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiation","weight":0.169179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"},{"name":"Lupus anticoagulant","weight":0.157569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_anticoagulant"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.0607308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Combined oral contraceptive pill","weight":0.0426461,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Birth control","weight":0.0308369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control"}]}
