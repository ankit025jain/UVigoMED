{"id":89909,"title":"Indirect surgical management of a penetrating vertebral artery injury.","abstract":"Vertebral artery injury caused by penetrating neck trauma is a rare occurrence. Direct surgical repair is difficult due to anatomy and exposure. Proximal and distal ligation or/and embolization represent the most common management in cases which require intervention.A young man accidentally stabbed in the neck was admitted to the emergency department with active arterial bleeding from the wound. Immediate surgical exploration revealed an isolated injury of the left vertebral artery intraosseous segment. Lesion was managed by proximal segment ligature and distal Fogarty catheter balloon-tamponade. Postoperative angiography excluded the need for further interventions. Balloon-catheter was successfully extracted after 72 hours and patient discharged neurologically intact on postoperative day 7. Fourteen months later, there are no signs of vascular or neurologic complications.Balloon-tamponade is a valuable technical adjunct in either temporizing or definitive management of surgically inaccessible vascular trauma.","date":"2014-11-12","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668058","annotations":[{"name":"Vertebral artery","weight":0.877375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_artery"},{"name":"Ligature (medicine)","weight":0.824154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.801736,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.78464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.727042,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.697426,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.694294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.688906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.672096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.664808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.535822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.533539,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.473665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.402271,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Embolization","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embolization"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.123431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Stabbing","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabbing"},{"name":"Intraosseous infusion","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraosseous_infusion"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Professor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"}]}
