{"id":83185,"title":"Specificity protein 1 is a novel target of 2,4-bis (p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal for the suppression of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell growth.","abstract":"The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction occurring between a reducing sugar and an amino acid, generally requiring thermal processing. Maillard reaction products (MRPs) have antioxidant, antimutagenic, and antibacterial effects though 2,4-bis (p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal (HPB242), a fructose-tyrosine MRP, appears to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, its mechanism of action has not been studied in detail. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-proliferative effects of 2,4-bis (p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal (HPB242) on two oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines, HN22 and HSC4, through regulation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1).HPB242 treatment dramatically reduced the cell growth rate and apoptotic cell morphologies. Sp1 was significantly inhibited by HPB242 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, cell cycle regulating proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins, which are known as Sp1 target genes, were altered at the molecular levels. The key important regulators in the cell cycle such as p27 were increased, whereas cell proliferation- and survival-related proteins such as cyclin D1, myeloid leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) and survivin were significantly decreased by HPB242 or suppressed Sp1 levels, however pro-apoptotic proteins caspase3 and PARP were cleaved in HN22 and HSC4.HPB242 may be useful as a chemotherapeutic agent for OSCC for the purpose of treatment and prevention of oral cancer and for the improvement of clinical outcomes.","date":"2014-02-20","categories":"Stomatognathic
