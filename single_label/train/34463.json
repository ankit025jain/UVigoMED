{"id":34463,"title":"hCG in screening for aneuploidy: a possible role for its glycoforms?","abstract":"Fetal trisomy 21 is associated with elevated maternal serum hCG and its free beta-subunit (hCG-beta) in vivo, and abnormal placental hCG production and glycosylation in vitro. Other maternal serum markers may also be disrupted in major aneuploidies (T21, T18, T13). We evaluated our aneuploidy screening practices, focusing on hCG-beta and hCG glycoforms, and retrospectively analyzed 55 aneuploidy cases diagnosed over a 2 year period, determining maternal serum hCG glycoforms profiles using 2D-electrophoresis. Screening efficiency reached 96.7%. T21 was associated with elevated hCG-beta while T18 presented with diminished serum markers. hCG glycoforms tended to be basic in aneuploidy (mainly T13).","date":"2014-05-13","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731729","annotations":[{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.615767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.509903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Glycosylation","weight":0.433237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.416275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Human chorionic gonadotropin","weight":0.396535,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin"},{"name":"Aneuploidy","weight":0.313889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy"},{"name":"Trisomy 21","weight":0.14701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy_21"},{"name":"Screening (medicine)","weight":0.125733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(medicine)"},{"name":"Trisomy","weight":0.107094,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy"},{"name":"Eutheria","weight":0.020818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria"},{"name":"Free software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"International Committee for Information Technology Standards","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_for_Information_Technology_Standards"},{"name":"Maternal death","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"},{"name":"Elevated railway","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_railway"},{"name":"Genetic marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_marker"},{"name":"Slingsby T.21","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingsby_T.21"}]}
