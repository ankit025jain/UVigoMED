{"id":53540,"title":"Biomarkers for predicting complete debulking in ovarian cancer: lessons to be learned.","abstract":"We aimed to construct and validate a model based on biomarkers to predict complete primary debulking surgery for ovarian cancer patients.The study consisted of three parts: Part I: Biomarker data obtained from mass spectrometry, baseline data and, surgical outcome were used to construct predictive indices for complete tumour resection; Part II: sera from randomly selected patients from part I were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to investigate the correlation to mass spectrometry; Part III: the indices from part I were validated in a new cohort of patients.Part I: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.82 for both indices. Part II: Linear regression analysis gave an R(2) value of 0.52 and 0.63 for transferrin and ?2-microglobulin, respectively. Part III: The AUC of the two indices decreased to 0.64.Our validated model based on biomarkers was unable to predict surgical outcome for patients with ovarian cancer.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24510999","annotations":[{"name":"Linear regression","weight":0.834224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.795798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Receiver operating characteristic","weight":0.708774,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.581248,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.536272,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.344169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Mass spectrometry","weight":0.31224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.261626,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.237666,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.216731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.208685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.198912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"ELISA","weight":0.12873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA"},{"name":"Integral","weight":0.0392089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Transferrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferrin"},{"name":"Debulking","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debulking"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0266351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Mass","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"Spectroscopy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"},{"name":"Curve","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve"},{"name":"R (programming language)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"},{"name":"Receiver (radio)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio)"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"List of Naruto chapters (Part I)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Naruto_chapters_(Part_I)"},{"name":"Linear","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Characteristic (algebra)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_(algebra)"},{"name":"Index (economics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)"},{"name":"Conceptual model","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model"},{"name":"Primary education","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education"},{"name":"Validity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity"}]}
