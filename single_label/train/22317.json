{"id":22317,"title":"[Pulmonary. High tech in pulmonary medicine: GeneXpert, coils and bronchial thermoplasty].","abstract":"We discuss here three recent applications of high technology in pulmonary medicine. GeneXpert has considerably improved the diagnosis of active tuberculosis. However, the test has also its limits so that clinical assessment, radiology, and sputum microscopy remain fundamental. Treatment of severe emphysema by lung volume reduction is no longer confined to surgical approach, but is now possible by bronchoscopy. Implantation of Nitinol coils in the most diseased parts of the emphysematous lung is a promising technique. Finally, several clinical trials on bronchial thermoplasty have been reported for intractable asthma. The recent publication of the long term effects of this technique is the occasion to update on this matter.","date":"2014-02-24","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558916","annotations":[{"name":"Emphysema","weight":0.894932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphysema"},{"name":"Bronchoscopy","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy"},{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"Sputum","weight":0.821773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.795167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Pulmonology","weight":0.793943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Asthma","weight":0.754493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.748217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.666623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.528037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.516498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Lung volumes","weight":0.448361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_volumes"},{"name":"Technology","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.160731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Matter","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Publishing","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing"},{"name":"Chronic pain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain"},{"name":"Heat exchanger","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exchanger"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Voxel-based morphometry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0136738,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"}]}
