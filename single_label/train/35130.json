{"id":35130,"title":"Comparative study on attitudes and psychological problems of mothers towards their children with developmental disability.","abstract":"Parents' positive attitudes and psychological wellbeing play an important role in the development of the children with developmental disability. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of psychological problems among mothers of children with autism disorder, intellectual disability, and Down syndrome. The second aim was to assess the differences in mothers' attitudes and psychological problems among their children with intellectual disability, autism disorder, and Down syndrome. The third aim was to identify whether negative attitude was a predictor of psychological problems in these mothers.In this study, 112 mothers of children having mild and moderate levels of autism disorder, Down syndrome, and intellectual disability were assessed using the Parental Attitude Scale and General Health Questionnaire-28.Overall, mothers of children with intellectual disability were found to have the most negative attitude towards their child. Mothers of children with autism disorder exhibited higher scores on somatic symptoms, anxiety, and social dysfunction when compared with their counterparts with Down syndrome and intellectual disability. Negative attitude was a significant predictor of psychological problems.Parental attitudes and psychological problems would vary among mothers of children with different types of developmental disability.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676483","annotations":[{"name":"Down syndrome","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome"},{"name":"Developmental disability","weight":0.859443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability"},{"name":"Autism","weight":0.8337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Disability","weight":0.816331,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.812486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Mental disorder","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.734893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Social anxiety disorder","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.698754,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.683991,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.679861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.637189,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Child","weight":0.482424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child"},{"name":"Intellectual disability","weight":0.42408,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability"},{"name":"Attitude (psychology)","weight":0.416031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)"},{"name":"Human development (biology)","weight":0.239635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_development_(biology)"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Somatic","weight":0.0346026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic"},{"name":"Social","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social"},{"name":"Intellectual","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Developmental biology","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology"},{"name":"Parent","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent"},{"name":"Moderate","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate"},{"name":"Dysfunctional family","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_family"},{"name":"Play (activity)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)"}]}
