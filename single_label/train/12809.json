{"id":12809,"title":"Relationship between ischemia/reperfusion injury and acute rejection of allogeneic liver transplant in rats.","abstract":"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the severity of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the acute rejection (AR) of allogeneic liver transplants in rats.The experimental rats were divided in different groups: normal control group (sham group, group I); syngeneic liver transplant control group (similar gene group, group II); and allogeneic liver transplant groups (groups III to VI). The rats were humanely killed at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after transplantation or sham operation to determine the severity of I/R injury, rejection classification, and hepatocyte apoptosis. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels of Fas, perforin, and granzyme B were assessed in the liver tissues using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively.The rejection scores of the transplanted liver tissues gradually increased until these scores were proportional to the severity of I/R injury in groups III, IV, and V. The maximum scores were reached at 7 days after transplantation as the duration of transplantation was extended. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Fas, perforin, and granzyme B were significantly increased at 1, 3, 3, 5, and 7 days after liver reperfusion in groups III, IV, and V compared with those in groups I, II, and VI (P < .05).The occurrence of AR after allogeneic liver transplantation in rats was positively correlated with the severity of I/R injury. Given that I/R injury caused serious damage to the transplanted liver, the occurrence of AR consequently decreased.","date":"2014-02-10","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24507025","annotations":[{"name":"Immunohistochemistry","weight":0.901385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry"},{"name":"Hepatocyte","weight":0.872293,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte"},{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.869327,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Messenger RNA","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.810569,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Organ transplantation","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_transplantation"},{"name":"Allotransplantation","weight":0.75822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotransplantation"},{"name":"Liver transplantation","weight":0.755785,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplantation"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.729747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Syngenic","weight":0.711758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngenic"},{"name":"Liver","weight":0.689222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"},{"name":"Transplant rejection","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.581573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.464373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Perforin","weight":0.455845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforin"},{"name":"Intravenous therapy","weight":0.355984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.296588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Protein expression (biotechnology)","weight":0.251422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_expression_(biotechnology)"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.241683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.200868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Reperfusion injury","weight":0.163355,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.122438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Group I catalytic intron","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_I_catalytic_intron"},{"name":"Infrared","weight":0.035931,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Granzyme","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granzyme"},{"name":"GZMB","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GZMB"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0226287,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Androgen receptor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor"},{"name":"Group II intron","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_II_intron"},{"name":"Fas ligand","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fas_ligand"}]}
