{"id":90646,"title":"Assessing vascular status and risk of latent ischemia with ankle fracture: a case report and algorithm for treatment.","abstract":"A paucity of published studies and clinical recommendations are available regarding ankle fracture and its association with vascular injury, likely because of the lower incidence relative to the more commonly seen popliteal artery injury after knee dislocation. In the present case report, we describe a previously healthy patient who experienced a pilon type ankle fracture (AO 43C2) with fibular and syndesmotic involvement, followed by a subacute presentation of vascular ischemia weeks after the initial injury and repair, ultimately leading to a major amputation. The failure to identify an occult, vascular injury can have devastating consequences. Guidelines regarding the identification and management of displaced ankle fracture-associated vascular injury, drawing evidence from other traumatic injury complexes, could improve the clinical outcomes. We aim to raise awareness of the association of vascular embarrassment secondary to ankle fracture by proposing a clinical practice algorithm to aid clinicians in recognizing traumatic vascular injury at the earliest and most treatable stage.
