{"id":88756,"title":"[Progress in treatment of pubic symphysis diastasis].","abstract":"To summarize the progress in treatment of pubic symphysis diastasis.Related literature concerning treatment of pubic symphysis diastasis was extensively reviewed and comprehensively analyzed in terms of anatomy, biomechanics, and treatment.There are many fixation methods for treatment of pubic symphysis diastasis, which aims at restoring the stability of the anterior pelvic ring. External fixator is often used as a temporary fixation; tension band wire has been abandoned due to its poor biomechanical stability; screw loosening and plate breakage often appears when a single reconstruction plate is used; box plate significantly increases the biomechanical stability of anterior pelvic ring but it leads to a considerable surgical trauma; locking plate has been used for pubic symphysis diastasis recently, especially for osteoporotic fractures; percutaneous cannulated screw has the advantages of less trauma, less bleeding, and good stability, so it is good choice for treatment of pubic symphysis diastasis.There is no uniform standards about the treatment of pubic symphysis diastasis, but the minimally invasive treatment is an undeniable trend. Percutaneous cannulated screw has achieved satisfactory effectiveness, however, its biomechanical stability and anatomic channels need to be further studied.","date":"2014-05-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796204","annotations":[{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.767485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.750676,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.720727,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.677347,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.655043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.551844,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.476365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Pubic symphysis","weight":0.352778,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_symphysis"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.302114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Anterior","weight":0.278477,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"},{"name":"Cannula","weight":0.276698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannula"},{"name":"Percutaneous","weight":0.221041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percutaneous"},{"name":"Pubis (bone)","weight":0.208715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubis_(bone)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.170898,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.143827,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Symphysis","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphysis"},{"name":"Diastasis symphysis pubis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastasis_symphysis_pubis"},{"name":"Tension (physics)","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tension_(physics)"},{"name":"Ion channel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Propeller","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller"},{"name":"Plate tectonics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"},{"name":"Wire","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"},{"name":"Uniform","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Progress (spacecraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_(spacecraft)"},{"name":"Related","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Related"},{"name":"Stability theory","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory"},{"name":"Internal fixation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_fixation"}]}
