{"id":90907,"title":"Outcomes of conservative treatment for ruptured lumbar disc herniation.","abstract":"The authors set up a prospective study of the effect of conservative treatment on a ruptured lumbar disc herniation in 89 patients, between June 2008 and June 2010. Seventy-two patients (81%) improved, while the other 17 (19%) needed surgery. The JOA score (best possible result: 29) was found to be significantly improved in the 72 patients of the conservative group, at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years (t-test: p < 0.001). At final follow-up, after 2 years, 84.7% of the patients in the conservative group had a good or excellent result. However, if the 17 surgical cases were included, this proportion dropped to 68.5%. The volume of the protrusion decreased significantly in the 72 patients of the conservative group: from 1422.52 +/- 539.10 mm3 to 102735 +/- 585.51 mm3 (paired t-test: p < 0.001). There was a definite correlation, in the conservative group, between the final resorption rate on the one hand and the percentage of combined excellent and good results on the other hand (72 cases; Spearman rank correlation coefficient: r 0.01 = 0.470, p < 0.001).","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24563981","annotations":[{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.244282,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.140812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Spearman's rank correlation coefficient","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"Volume","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Coefficient","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient"},{"name":"Spinal disc herniation","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Compact Disc","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"585","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/585"},{"name":"2008","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008"},{"name":"1422","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1422"},{"name":"Hernia","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernia"},{"name":"Score (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)"},{"name":"Ranking","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking"},{"name":"Exophthalmos","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophthalmos"},{"name":"Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_Preservation_Act_of_1970"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Definiteness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness"},{"name":"Rank correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_correlation"},{"name":"Outcome (game theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(game_theory)"},{"name":"Best execution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_execution"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Lumbar vertebrae","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient"},{"name":"470 (dinghy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/470_(dinghy)"},{"name":"Resorption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resorption"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Conservatism","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism"}]}
