{"id":13062,"title":"Antibodies against avian-like A (H1N1) swine influenza virus among swine farm residents in eastern China.","abstract":"In 2007, the avian-like H1N1 virus (A/swine/Zhejiang/1/07) was first isolated in pigs in China. Recently, it was reported that a 3-year-old boy was infected with avian-like A (H1N1) swine influenza virus (SIV) in Jiangsu Province, China. To investigate the prevalence of avian-like A (H1N1) SIV infection among swine farm residents in eastern China, an active influenza surveillance program was conducted on swine farms in this region from May 21, 2010 through April 22, 2012. A total of 1,162 participants were enrolled, including 1,136 persons from 48 pig farms, as well as 26 pig farm veterinarians. A total of 10.7% and 7.8% swine farm residents were positive for antibodies against avian-like A (H1N1) SIV by HI and NT assay, respectively, using 40 as the cut-off antibody titer. Meanwhile, all the serum samples collected from a control of healthy city residents were negative against avian-like A (H1N1) SIV. As the difference in numbers of antibody positive samples between the swine farm residents and health city residents controls was statistically significant (P?=?0.002), these data suggest that occupational exposure to pigs may increase swine farm residents' and veterinarians' risk of avian-like A (H1N1) SIV infection in eastern China. This study provides the first data on avian-like A (H1N1) SIV infections in humans in China; the potential for avian-like A (H1N1) SIV entering the human population should also be taken into consideration.","date":"2014-02-05","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497077","annotations":[{"name":"Influenza","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Swine influenza","weight":0.792712,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_influenza"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.765521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.70318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"China","weight":0.65285,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Orthomyxoviridae","weight":0.63907,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae"},{"name":"World population","weight":0.619435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"},{"name":"Pig","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig"},{"name":"Blood plasma","weight":0.532872,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"},{"name":"Domestic pig","weight":0.44368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.425361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Influenza A virus subtype H1N1","weight":0.412396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1"},{"name":"Serology","weight":0.41009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology"},{"name":"Farm","weight":0.350695,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.315713,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.208579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Hemagglutinin","weight":0.131422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"},{"name":"Titer","weight":0.113142,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titer"},{"name":"Veterinarian","weight":0.109465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.0582564,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"April 22","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_22"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0558853,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Simian immunodeficiency virus","weight":0.0500448,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian_immunodeficiency_virus"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Jiangsu","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu"},{"name":"Healthy city","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_city"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0217362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Occupational safety and health","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health"},{"name":"Hawaii","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii"},{"name":"May 21","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_21"},{"name":"New Testament","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament"},{"name":"2007","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007"},{"name":"Province","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province"},{"name":"City","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City"},{"name":"Region","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region"},{"name":"2010 FIFA World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup"},{"name":"Consideration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration"},{"name":"Pig farming","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_farming"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
