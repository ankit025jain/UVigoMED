{"id":74547,"title":"BrainPrint: identifying subjects by their brain.","abstract":"Introducing BrainPrint, a compact and discriminative representation of anatomical structures in the brain. BrainPrint captures shape information of an ensemble of cortical and subcortical structures by solving the 2D and 3D Laplace-Beltrami operator on triangular (boundary) and tetrahedral (volumetric) meshes. We derive a robust classifier for this representation that identifies the subject in a new scan, based on a database of brain scans. In an example dataset containing over 3000 MRI scans, we show that BrainPrint captures unique information about the subject's anatomy and permits to correctly classify a scan with an accuracy of over 99.8%. All processing steps for obtaining the compact representation are fully automated making this processing framework particularly attractive for handling large datasets.","date":"2014-10-16","categories":"Nervous System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320780","annotations":[{"name":"Volume","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.803284,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Data set","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set"},{"name":"3D computer graphics","weight":0.722734,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Polygon mesh","weight":0.675547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh"},{"name":"Brain","weight":0.56606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain"},{"name":"Tetrahedron","weight":0.54175,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.498165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.427707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.31415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.298818,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.254482,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"2D computer graphics","weight":0.22212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics"},{"name":"Cerebral cortex","weight":0.150812,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"},{"name":"Compact space","weight":0.133431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space"},{"name":"Triangle","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0460915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Image processing","weight":0.038706,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0332387,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Tertiary structure","weight":0.0242611,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_structure"},{"name":"Discrimination","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"},{"name":"Linear map","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map"},{"name":"Musical ensemble","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble"},{"name":"Boundary (topology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology)"},{"name":"Software framework","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"},{"name":"Robust statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics"},{"name":"Democratic Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"Statistical classification","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Representation (arts)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(arts)"}]}
