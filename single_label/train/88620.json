{"id":88620,"title":"Topogram-based automated selection of the tube potential and current in thoraco-abdominal trauma CT - a comparison to fixed kV with mAs modulation alone.","abstract":"To investigate the impact of automated attenuation-based tube potential selection on image quality and exposure parameters in polytrauma patients undergoing contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal CT.One hundred patients were examined on a 16-slice device at 120 kV with 190 ref.mAs and automated mA modulation only. Another 100 patients underwent 128-slice CT with automated mA modulation and topogram-based automated tube potential selection (autokV) at 100, 120 or 140 kV. Volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)), dose-length product (DLP), body diameters, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and subjective image quality were compared.In the autokV group, 100 kV was automatically selected in 82 patients, 120 kV in 12 patients and 140 kV in 6 patients. Patient diameters increased with higher kV settings. The median CTDI(vol) (8.3 vs. 12.4 mGy; -33%) and DLP (594 vs. 909 mGy cm; -35%) in the entire autokV group were significantly lower than in the group with fixed 120 kV (p?<?0.05 for both). Image quality remained at a constantly high level at any selected kV level.Topogram-based automated selection of the tube potential allows for significant dose savings in thoraco-abdominal trauma CT while image quality remains at a constantly high level.• Automated kV selection in thoraco-abdominal trauma CT results in significant dose savings • Most patients benefit from a 100-kV protocol with relevant DLP reduction • Constantly good image quality is ensured • Image quality benefits from higher kV when arms are positioned downward.","date":"2014-06-06","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24816940","annotations":[{"name":"Volt","weight":0.55602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt"},{"name":"Modulation","weight":0.440988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation"},{"name":"Signal-to-noise ratio","weight":0.419155,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.337213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"X-ray computed tomography","weight":0.311096,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography"},{"name":"Ampere","weight":0.293043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.266245,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.141013,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.114498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Vacuum tube","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube"},{"name":"Centimetre","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre"},{"name":"Redox","weight":0.078616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"},{"name":"Noise","weight":0.073608,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Gray (unit)","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit)"},{"name":"Digital Light Processing","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Light_Processing"},{"name":"Polytrauma","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytrauma"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"594","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/594"},{"name":"909","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/909"},{"name":"8.3 filename","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename"},{"name":"Saving","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving"},{"name":"Exposure (photography)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Imaging science","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_science"},{"name":"Image quality","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality"},{"name":"Communications protocol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol"},{"name":"Group (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Weapon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"},{"name":"Product (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)"},{"name":"Subjectivity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity"}]}
