{"id":76847,"title":"Metabolic syndrome improvement in depression six months after prescribing simple hygienic-dietary recommendations.","abstract":"Changes in diet and exercise have been separately demonstrated to improve Depression, although scientific evidence available is scarce. In a previously published controlled study, just recommending these and other lifestyle measures (sleep restriction and sunlight exposure) in combination once, patients experienced improvements in their depressive symptoms six months later. In this sample, one in three depressive patients had metabolic syndrome (MetS) at baseline. First line treatment of MetS condition is hygienic-dietetic, being Mediterranean diet and exercise especially important. Therefore we analyzed if lifestyle recommendations also improved their metabolic profile.During the sixth month evaluation, a smaller number of patients from the group receiving hygienic-dietary recommendations met MetS criteria comparing with the control group.This study suggests that costless lifestyle recommendations, such as exercise and Mediterranean diet, have the capacity to promote both mental and physical health in a significant proportion of depressive patients. Further research is needed to confirm or discard these preliminary findings.","date":"2014-06-13","categories":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899528","annotations":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","weight":0.870652,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome"},{"name":"Diet (nutrition)","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.781524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Sleep","weight":0.778805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep"},{"name":"Metabolism","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Physical exercise","weight":0.695621,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.675125,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.674145,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Scientific control","weight":0.667165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_control"},{"name":"Lifestyle (sociology)","weight":0.601707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"Mediterranean diet","weight":0.517693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet"},{"name":"Hypothermia","weight":0.390105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.318291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Research","weight":0.307031,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research"},{"name":"First-line treatment","weight":0.286491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-line_treatment"},{"name":"Medical prescription","weight":0.268093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription"},{"name":"Sunlight","weight":0.204374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight"},{"name":"Treatment group","weight":0.178431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_group"},{"name":"Mediterranean Sea","weight":0.0575759,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Scientific evidence","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Great Depression","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"World War I","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"},{"name":"Regulation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"},{"name":"Social group","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group"}]}
