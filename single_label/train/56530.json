{"id":56530,"title":"Combination treatment of pediatric coats' disease: a bicenter study in Taiwan.","abstract":"To present the clinical outcome of different combination treatment modalities in pediatric Coats' disease in two Taiwan medical centers.A retrospective review of clinical records was done of pediatric patients with Coats' disease treated at National Taiwan University Hospital and Changhua Christian Hospital. Data regarding the age at the time of diagnosis, initial presentation, methods of treatment, visual and anatomic results, and complications were recorded. Changes in vision and retinal status with the different methods of treatment were specifically evaluated.From 2005 through 2011, 10 eyes of 9 patients were treated under the diagnosis of Coats' disease. The clinical manifestations varied from localized vascular abnormalities with subretinal fluid and hard exudates to extensive detachment with massive exudates and retinal hemorrhage. The main treatment modalities include argon laser photocoagulation, micropulse laser, and cryotherapy. The adjunctive therapies included intravitreal triamcinolone, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab. The mean follow-up was 40.50 Â± 20.52 months (range: 14 to 72 months). Best corrected visual acuity at last follow-up was light perception to 1.0 (20/20 Snellen). Anatomic improvement was achieved in 9 eyes (90%). Visual improvement was noted in 7 eyes (70%), visual stabilization in 2 eyes (20%), and visual deterioration in 1 eye (10%). Vitreous fibrosis evolving into tractional retinal detachment occurred in 1 patient receiving cryotherapy combined with intravitreal bevacizumab injections. No enucleation was ultimately necessary.Pediatric Coats' disease varies greatly in severity. Carefully selected treatment modalities can improve most eyes with different conditions. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents may act as useful adjuncts to improve anatomic and functional outcome. Cryotherapy combined with the intravitreal bevacizumab injection in severe cases of exudative retinal detachment may carry the risk of vitreoretinal traction and tractional retinal detachment.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24669373","annotations":[{"name":"Eye
