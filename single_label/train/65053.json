{"id":65053,"title":"[Association of 8-hydroxyguanine glycosidase OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism with male infertility].","abstract":"To explore the association of 8-hydroxyguanine glycosidase OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism with semen quality and the risk of male infertility.This case-control study included 620 idiopathic infertile patients and 385 normal fertile controls. We determined their genotypes by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and analyzed their semen quality by computer-aided semen analysis (CASA).The individuals with OGG1 326 Cys/Cys showed significantly lower sperm motility and concentration ([52.1 +/- 26.7]% and (3.75 +/- 0.91) x 10(6)/ml, ln transformed value) than the Ser/Ser carriers ([59.0 +/- 21.8] % and (4.12 +/- 0.88) x 10(6)/ml, ln transformed value) (P < 0.05). The risk of male infertility increased 69% in the OGG1 326Cys allele carriers as compared with the Ser carriers (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.24 -2.31).OGG1 326 Ser/Cys polymorphism might contribute to the risk of male infertility in the southern Chinese population.","date":"2014-07-17","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25029857","annotations":[{"name":"Allele","weight":0.850585,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele"},{"name":"Fertility","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility"},{"name":"Genotype","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype"},{"name":"Semen quality","weight":0.769027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_quality"},{"name":"Sperm","weight":0.751207,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm"},{"name":"Infertility","weight":0.748032,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility"},{"name":"Semen analysis","weight":0.73916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis"},{"name":"Motility","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility"},{"name":"Semen","weight":0.721359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen"},{"name":"Idiopathic","weight":0.719037,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic"},{"name":"Polymorphism (biology)","weight":0.712402,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)"},{"name":"Male infertility","weight":0.651895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_infertility"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.585627,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Sperm motility","weight":0.532491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_motility"},{"name":"Litre","weight":0.266665,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre"},{"name":"China","weight":0.210667,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.126567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Ogg","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg"},{"name":"Glycoside hydrolase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside_hydrolase"},{"name":"Oxoguanine glycosylase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxoguanine_glycosylase"},{"name":"Serine","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine"},{"name":"Normal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"},{"name":"Natural logarithm","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"69 (sex position)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/69_(sex_position)"},{"name":"South India","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Northern and southern China","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China"},{"name":"Genetic carrier","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_carrier"},{"name":"Minuscule 326","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuscule_326"}]}
