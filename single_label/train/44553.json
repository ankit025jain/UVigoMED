{"id":44553,"title":"Delivering optimal care for inflammatory bowel disease patients in Scotland in 2014.","abstract":"The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, present an ever increasing burden to the healthcare systems in the Western world. Scotland in particular has seen a significant increase in both diseases, particularly Crohn's disease. It is thus of paramount importance that secondary care services within Scotland are equipped to cope with this increased demand at a time when the treatment options are broadening, patients expectations are increasing and healthcare budgets face major restriction. This article outlines some aspects of optimal delivery of an IBD service in secondary care.
