{"id":47982,"title":"Tamoxifen compared to best supportive care in advanced hepatocelluar carcinoma: A retrospective matched-cohort study.","abstract":"Hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide as well as in Egypt with hepatitis B and C, alcohol and aflatoxins being the commonest risk factors. Tamoxifen was initially reported to confer a marginal survival benefit in advanced HCC. However, later reports declined any benefit.To study the impact of tamoxifen on overall survival (OS) compared to best supportive care (BSC) in Egyptian patients with advanced HCC.This retrospective matched-cohort study was conducted at Tanta Cancer Center (TCC), Egypt where 116 advanced HCC cases treated with tamoxifen were compared to TNM stage and Child-Pugh class matched 116 HCC cases who received BSC.The median OS in the tamoxifen group was 9.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-11.9 months) compared to 8.7 months (95%CI, 6.8-10.6) in the BSC group (p=0.758). With univariate analyses, it was shown that absence of fatigue, Child-Pugh class A, single tumors, less advanced tumors (T2), and absence of metastases (M0), had significantly better OS than their counterparts. Multivariate analysis showed that absence of fatigue, Child-Pugh class A and T2 tumors were independent prognostic factors affecting OS. Tamoxifen produced partial response and clinical stabilization in one% and 16% of cases, respectively. The median PFS with tamoxifen was 7.2 months (95%CI, 5.2-9.5).Tamoxifen did not show any OS advantage in Egyptian patients with advanced HCC. Use of this drug is discouraged.","date":"2014-02-25","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24565676","annotations":[{"name":"Tamoxifen","weight":0.893958,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamoxifen"},{"name":"Hepatitis B","weight":0.874928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Metastasis","weight":0.790973,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"},{"name":"Fatigue (medical)","weight":0.789254,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)"},{"name":"Aflatoxin","weight":0.776243,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aflatoxin"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.773497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.768313,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Hepatitis","weight":0.75796,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.610903,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.572072,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Survival rate","weight":0.517041,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Alcohol","weight":0.499113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"},{"name":"TNM staging system","weight":0.472431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNM_staging_system"},{"name":"Egypt","weight":0.434824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.295642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Magnetic resonance imaging","weight":0.0855793,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.0554043,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Tanta","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanta"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"Independence (probability theory)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)"},{"name":"810","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/810"},{"name":"758","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/758"},{"name":"711","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/711"},{"name":"Class (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)"},{"name":"Single (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(music)"},{"name":"Film producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"},{"name":"Marginal distribution","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution"},{"name":"Professional File System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_File_System"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"British Society of Cinematographers","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Society_of_Cinematographers"},{"name":"Hindustan Construction Company","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Construction_Company"},{"name":"Univariate","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"},{"name":"Carbon","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"M0 motorway (Hungary)","weight":0.0137481,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M0_motorway_(Hungary)"}]}
