{"id":92514,"title":"[X-ray characteristics of posterolateral rotatory instability of the elbow caused by ligament injury].","abstract":"To study the role of lateral collateral ligament complex on the posterolateral rotatory instability and the relationship between the radiocapitellar ratio (RCR) and the injury of lateral collateral ligament complex on X-ray images.Twenty elbow joints from fresh-frozen adult cadavers were used to make osteo-ligamentous elbow specimens. The specimens were fixed with a self-made device to maintain posterolateral rotatory instability of the elbow joint. All the specimens were divided into two groups: group A and group B. Surgical procedures were carried out as follows in the lateral structures of group A: A1, intact specimen; A2, transection of radial ulnar collateral ligament firstly; A3, transection of annular ligament secondly; A4, final transection of the radial collateral ligament. The procedures in group B were carried out as follows: B1, intact specimen; B2, transection of the radial collateral ligament firstly; B3, transection of the annular ligament secondly; B4, final transection of the radial ulnar collateral ligament. Lateral X-ray films of elbow joint were taken, and the radiocapitellar ratio (RCR) was measured by using PACS. All analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0 software.Group A: the increases in RCR had statistical differences among A1, A2, A3, and A4 groups. Group B: the increases in RCR had no statistical differences among B1, B2 and B3 groups; but the increase in RCR in group B4 was more than that in B1, B2 and B3 groups.The radial ulnar collateral ligament is a key structure to maintain posterolateral rotatory stability;the radial collateral ligament and the annular ligament are the secondary important structures. There are 4 grades of the posterolateral rotatory instability of the elbow, according to the X-ray imaging classification.","date":"2015-01-12","categories":"Musculoskeletal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577912","annotations":[{"name":"Joint","weight":0.676274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Elbow","weight":0.65169,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow"},{"name":"X-ray","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"},{"name":"Anular ligament of radius","weight":0.456468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anular_ligament_of_radius"},{"name":"Fibular collateral ligament","weight":0.360368,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibular_collateral_ligament"},{"name":"Ligament","weight":0.359483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.261381,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.210873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.152154,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.0750165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Radius","weight":0.0610634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"},{"name":"Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint","weight":0.041755,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_of_elbow_joint"},{"name":"Cadaver","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver"},{"name":"SPSS","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS"},{"name":"Radial collateral ligament of elbow joint","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_collateral_ligament_of_elbow_joint"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0269926,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Psychoanalysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"List of surgical procedures","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Annulus (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Key (lock)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(lock)"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Film","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"},{"name":"Complexity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity"},{"name":"High school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Instability","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability"},{"name":"Specimen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specimen"},{"name":"Collateral (finance)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)"},{"name":"Ulnar artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_artery"},{"name":"Intel Core (microarchitecture)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_(microarchitecture)"},{"name":"Richard Childress Racing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Childress_Racing"},{"name":"Educational stage","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_stage"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Picture archiving and communication system","weight":0.0119316,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_archiving_and_communication_system"}]}
