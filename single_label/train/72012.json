{"id":72012,"title":"Retroviral-infection increases tumorigenic potential of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells by expanding an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) positive stem-cell like population.","abstract":"Retroviral transformation has been associated with pro-proliferative oncogenic signaling in human cells. The current study demonstrates that transduction of human breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB231) with LXSN and QCXIP retroviral vectors causes significant increases in growth rate, clonogenic fraction, and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 positive cells (ALDH1+), which is associated with increased steady-state levels of cancer stem cell populations. Furthermore, this retroviral-induced enhancement of cancer cell growth in vitro was also accompanied by a significant increase in xenograft tumor growth rate in vivo. The retroviral induced increases in cancer cell growth rate were partially inhibited by treatment with 100?U/ml polyethylene glycol-conjugated-(PEG)-superoxide dismutase and/or PEG-catalase. These results show that retroviral infection of MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells is capable of enhancing cell proliferation and cancer stem cell populations as well as suggesting that modulation of reactive oxygen species-induced pro-survival signaling pathways may be involved in these effects.","date":"2014-07-10","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009786","annotations":[{"name":"Cancer stem cell","weight":0.913129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"Signal transduction","weight":0.851115,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction"},{"name":"Breast cancer","weight":0.816298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Retrovirus","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Reactive oxygen species","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"},{"name":"Stem cell","weight":0.797552,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell"},{"name":"Transduction (genetics)","weight":0.752786,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)"},{"name":"Viral vector","weight":0.752214,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_vector"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Transformation (genetics)","weight":0.741915,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.734616,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Oxygen","weight":0.714353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.680879,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.654997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Cell signaling","weight":0.626962,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.599927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Breast","weight":0.595603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast"},{"name":"Neoplasm","weight":0.570166,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm"},{"name":"Aldehyde","weight":0.348478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde"},{"name":"Cancer cell","weight":0.316895,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell"},{"name":"List of distinct cell types in the adult human body","weight":0.287896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distinct_cell_types_in_the_adult_human_body"},{"name":"Polyethylene","weight":0.265046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Aldehyde dehydrogenase","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde_dehydrogenase"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.029746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"},{"name":"Fractionation","weight":0.0271741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractionation"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"HIV-1 protease","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV-1_protease"},{"name":"Vector (epidemiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Plant stem","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"},{"name":"Dehydrogenase","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydrogenase"}]}
