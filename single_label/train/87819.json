{"id":87819,"title":"Bracing for thoracolumbar fractures.","abstract":"Traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine are relatively common occurrences that can be a source of pain and disability. Similarly, osteoporotic vertebral fractures are also frequent events and represent a significant health issue specific to the elderly. Neurologically intact patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures can commonly be treated nonoperatively with bracing. Nonoperative treatment is not suitable for patients with neurological deficits or highly unstable fractures. The role of operative versus nonoperative treatment of burst fractures is controversial, with high-quality evidence supporting both options. Osteoporotic vertebral fractures can be managed with bracing or vertebral augmentation in most cases. There is, however, a lack of high-quality evidence comparing operative versus nonoperative fractures in this population. Bracing is a low-risk, cost-effective method to treat certain thoracolumbar fractures and offers efficacy equivalent to that of surgical management in many cases. The evidence for bracing of osteoporotic-type fractures is less clear, and further investigation will be necessary to delineate its optimal role.","date":"2014-07-01","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24981902","annotations":[{"name":"Disability","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.765294,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.747438,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.717761,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Osteoporosis","weight":0.64723,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis"},{"name":"Vertebral column","weight":0.624113,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.11349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"Orthotics","weight":0.110637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotics"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Fracture","weight":0.0670588,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0326396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"},{"name":"Radionuclide","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"},{"name":"Back brace","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_brace"},{"name":"Lateral horn of spinal cord","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Controversy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy"},{"name":"Government budget deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_deficit"},{"name":"Human enhancement","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_enhancement"},{"name":"Functional neurological deficit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_deficit"}]}
