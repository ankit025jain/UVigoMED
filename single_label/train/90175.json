{"id":90175,"title":"Stent recanalization of carotid tonsillar loop dissection using the Enterprise vascular reconstruction device.","abstract":"Although advances in endovascular techniques have permitted reconstruction of intimal dissections and related pseudoaneurysms of the extracranial cervical internal carotid artery, highly tortuous tonsillar loop anatomic variants still pose an obstacle to conventional extracranial self-expanding carotid stents. During a 12 year period, nine of 48 cases with cervical carotid dissections were associated with a tonsillar loop. Five patients required endovascular treatment, which was performed using a microcatheter-based technique with the low-profile Enterprise vascular reconstruction device (Codman Neurovascular, Raynham, MA, USA). Technical, radiographic, and clinical outcomes were analyzed for each patient. Dissection etiology was spontaneous in three patients, iatrogenic in one, and traumatic in one. Four near-occlusive tonsillar loop dissections were successfully recanalized during the acute phase. Dissection-related stenosis improved from 90±22% to 31±13%, with tandem stents needed in three instances to seal the inflow zone. There were no procedure-related transient ischemic attacks (TIA), minor/major strokes, or deaths. Angiographic follow-up for a mean of 28.0±21.6 months showed all stents were patent, with average stenosis of 25.2±12.2%. Focal ovalization and kinking of the closed-cell design was noted at the sharpest curve in one patient. Clinical outcome (follow-up of 28.1±21.5 months) demonstrated overall improvement with no clinical worsening, new TIA, or stroke. Tonsillar loop-associated carotid dissections can be successfully and durably recanalized using the low-profile Enterprise stent with an excellent long-term patency rate and low procedural risk. The possibility of stent kinking and low radial force should be considered when planning reconstruction with this device.","date":"2014-05-26","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642024","annotations":[{"name":"Iatrogenesis","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis"},{"name":"Internal carotid artery","weight":0.858224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.797521,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Stroke","weight":0.762559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.74978,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.689089,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Ischemia","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.670603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Transient ischemic attack","weight":0.667691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_ischemic_attack"},{"name":"Tunica intima","weight":0.659399,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunica_intima"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.469579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.444148,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Cervical vertebrae","weight":0.428168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.419954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Pseudoaneurysm","weight":0.368174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoaneurysm"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.263594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222966,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"United States","weight":0.220403,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"},{"name":"Patent","weight":0.210212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.157091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Vascular","weight":0.0636702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Medical device","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device"},{"name":"Radial artery","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_artery"}]}
