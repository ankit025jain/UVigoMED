{"id":71590,"title":"Quality of life and self-esteem in patients submitted to surgical treatment of skin carcinomas: long-term results.","abstract":"Cancer is a multifactorial disease and skin carcinomas are the most common type of cancer. Assessing quality of life and self-esteem outcomes in skin cancer patients is important because these are indicators of the results of the treatment, translating how patients face their lives and their personal relationships.To assess the late impact of the surgical treatment of head and/or neck skin carcinomas on quality of life and self-esteem of the patients.Fifty patients with head or neck skin carcinomas were enrolled. Their age ranged between 30 and 75 years, 27 were men and 23 were women. Patients were assessed with regard to quality of life and self-esteem, preoperatively and five years postoperatively. Validated instruments were used: the MOS 36-item Short-form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Rosenberg Self-esteem/EPM-UNIFESP Scale. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the statistical analysis.Twenty-two patients completed the five-year follow-up, 54.5% women and 45.5% men. Compared to the preoperative assessment, patients had an improvement in mental health (p=0.011) and in self-esteem (p=0.002). There was no statistical difference with regard to the other domains of the SF-36.Patients submitted to surgical treatment of skin carcinoma improved mental health and self-esteem in the late postsurgical testing.","date":"2014-07-24","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25054746","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.835806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.787393,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.777137,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.756238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.734333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.720466,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Skin","weight":0.665105,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.651095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Self-esteem","weight":0.570553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem"},{"name":"Translation","weight":0.443451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation"},{"name":"Interpersonal relationship","weight":0.347082,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship"},{"name":"Skin neoplasm","weight":0.256374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_neoplasm"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.20687,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Carcinoma","weight":0.164836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma"},{"name":"Mind","weight":0.142407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Science fiction","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Light-emitting diode","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"},{"name":"Mathematical analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"},{"name":"Protein domain","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain"},{"name":"Psychological evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation"},{"name":"Wilcoxon","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon"},{"name":"Shortform improvisation","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortform_improvisation"},{"name":"Neck","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck"},{"name":"Scale (anatomy)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Type (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)"},{"name":"Quantitative trait locus","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus"},{"name":"Quality (business)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)"}]}
