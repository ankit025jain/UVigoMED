{"id":21027,"title":"[Vaginal discharge in pregnant women: comparison between syndromic approach and examination of clinical nursing practice].","abstract":"This is a study for assessment of a quantitative approach in pregnant women (N=104), in which findings of vaginal infection were compared. The findings were obtained by two means, flowchart of vaginal discharge, and typical examinations in the clinical nursing practice. Data were collected from January to July 2011 through interviews and gynecological examinations. The flowchart showed no efficacy to identify candidiasis and trichomoniasis. Furthermore, it showed low sensitivity (0.0%; 50%) and positive predictive value (0.0%; 3.6%) for both infections, and low specificity for trichomoniasis (46%). The flowchart was shown to be satisfactory for bacterial vaginosis, with high sensitivity (100%), negative predictive value (100%), and accuracy (74%). We conclude that use of the flowchart should be reassessed, as it was not able to identify important infections in pregnant women. A continuous effort must be directed for development of effective tests in order to prevent the spread of infection and reduce the number of unnecessary treatments.
