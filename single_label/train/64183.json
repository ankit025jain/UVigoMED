{"id":64183,"title":"Assessing the readiness of a school system to adopt food allergy management guidelines.","abstract":"The prevalence of potentially fatal food allergies in school-aged children is rising. It is important for schools to have a food allergy management policy and an emergency action plan for each affected student.To examine the current status of food allergy guideline and/or policy implementation and adoption in a large school system in southeastern Wisconsin.A 24-item anonymous electronic survey was developed and completed by school principals and administrators in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee School System (approximately 125 schools) in southeastern Wisconsin.One in 4 responding schools reported no guidelines or policy. Schools that reported having students with special needs due to food allergy were more likely to have a local food allergy policy compared to schools that did not report having students with food allergy special needs (OR 6.3, 1.5-26, P = 0.01). Schools with food allergy guidelines/policies were 3.5 times more likely to require student individual action plans than schools with no guidelines or policies (OR 3.5, 1.00-12.2, P = 0.05).Gaps in evidence-based food allergy policy implementation were found in this school system. Schools with food-allergic children with special needs were more likely to have guidelines/policy, however, they were not more likely to require emergency action plans. The majority of schools (66, 90%) reported interest in receiving further information or training on food allergy management.","date":"2014-09-12","categories":"Immune System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211803","annotations":[{"name":"School","weight":0.621298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School"},{"name":"Special education","weight":0.587908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education"},{"name":"Student","weight":0.360168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.309465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Wisconsin","weight":0.246629,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin"},{"name":"Adoption","weight":0.207046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption"},{"name":"State school","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school"},{"name":"Special needs","weight":0.14573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_needs"},{"name":"Goal","weight":0.137544,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal"},{"name":"Head teacher","weight":0.110873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_teacher"},{"name":"Training","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training"},{"name":"Milwaukee","weight":0.0853846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee"},{"name":"Food","weight":0.0589103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"},{"name":"Allergy","weight":0.046517,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"},{"name":"Archbishop","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0352321,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Food allergy","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_allergy"},{"name":"Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Milwaukee"},{"name":"Surveying","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"},{"name":"Policy","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy"},{"name":"Electronics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"},{"name":"526","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/526"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Prevalence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"},{"name":"Anonymity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity"},{"name":"Guideline","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guideline"},{"name":"Gaps","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaps"},{"name":"Administration of business","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_business"},{"name":"Lawsuit","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Local food","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food"},{"name":"Implementation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation"},{"name":"Bundesautobahn 24","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesautobahn_24"}]}
