{"id":82737,"title":"The plasminogen activation system in periodontal tissue (Review).","abstract":"The plasminogen activation system (PAS) plays an essential role in tissue proteolysis in physiological and pathological processes. Periodontitis is a chronic infection associated with increased proteolysis driven by plasminogen activation. In this comprehensive review, we summarise the effects of PAS in wound healing, tissue remodelling, inflammation, bacterial infection, and in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease. Specifically, we discuss the role of plasminogen activators (PAs), including urokinase PA (uPA), tissue-type PA (tPA), PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and 2 (PAI-2) and activated plasminogen in periodontal tissue, where their concentrations can reach much higher values than those found in other parts of the body. We also discuss whether PA deficiencies can have effects on periodontal tissue. We conclude that in periodontal disease, PAS is unbalanced and equalizing its function can improve the clinical periodontal tissue condition.","date":"2014-02-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535478","annotations":[{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.846685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Chronic (medicine)","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.806959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Periodontitis","weight":0.747178,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.74384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Bacterial infection","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_infection"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.614865,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Physiology","weight":0.587222,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology"},{"name":"Periodontal disease","weight":0.559922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontal_disease"},{"name":"Plasmin","weight":0.476896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmin"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.461358,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.453752,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus type 1","weight":0.390881,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.384114,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1","weight":0.349464,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasminogen_activator_inhibitor-1"},{"name":"Urokinase","weight":0.284824,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urokinase"},{"name":"Periodontium","weight":0.195016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontium"},{"name":"Periodontology","weight":0.173396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontology"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.15589,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Transcription (genetics)","weight":0.129301,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)"},{"name":"Tissue plasminogen activator","weight":0.0506351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_plasminogen_activator"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.023857,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"Pennsylvania","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania"},{"name":"Physician assistant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_assistant"}]}
