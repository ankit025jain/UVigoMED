{"id":30914,"title":"[Defence mechanisms and coping strategies in men and women: a comparative and structural study based on the artistic production of people suffering from a break-up of their life project].","abstract":"A comparative study of men and women suffering from a break-up of their life project allowed us examining the typically female and male manners to cope with trauma, anxiety, guilt, depression and internal destructivity. In a first stage, an exploratory study was focussed on 206 subjects, belonging to several clinical subgroups: people living in great precarity and long-term unemployed people, asylum seekers and refugees, drug addicts, prisoners and people coming out of prison. Secondly, arts therapeutic sessions were proposed with the aim of helping the participants finding an outlet to their situation. The artistic production (drawings and stories induced by music) was analysed with the help of original rating scales, constructed in a phenomenological and structural perspective. We will present a synthesis of our qualitative observations, as well as some results of typological and structural studies, computed with the help of non parametric statistical procedures on the data of N = 93 participants. The results allow us pointing to gender differences and defining typically male and female coping styles. Differential indications for psychotherapy can be extracted from these analyses.","date":"2014-01-20","categories":"Chemically-Induced Disorders","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437072","annotations":[{"name":"Psychotherapy","weight":0.806949,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy"},{"name":"Gender","weight":0.800829,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender"},{"name":"Anxiety","weight":0.737578,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.713322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Suffering","weight":0.683977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.681737,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Male","weight":0.671548,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male"},{"name":"Major depressive disorder","weight":0.646662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"},{"name":"Unemployment","weight":0.61887,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"},{"name":"Guilt","weight":0.558365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt"},{"name":"Phenomenology (philosophy)","weight":0.555237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.483745,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.455443,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Prison","weight":0.40336,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison"},{"name":"Refugee","weight":0.362283,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.333385,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Coping (psychology)","weight":0.312919,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(psychology)"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.291724,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Music","weight":0.201782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.193878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Psychological trauma","weight":0.151365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma"},{"name":"Theatre","weight":0.128014,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre"},{"name":"The arts","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts"},{"name":"Coming out","weight":0.0792562,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out"},{"name":"Psychiatric hospital","weight":0.0654116,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"Defence mechanism","weight":0.0383291,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism"},{"name":"Manners","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manners"},{"name":"Sex differences in humans","weight":0.0355959,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Record producer","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer"},{"name":"Music genre","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre"},{"name":"Painting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting"},{"name":"Personality type","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type"},{"name":"Nitrogen","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"},{"name":"Structure","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure"},{"name":"Relationship breakup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_breakup"}]}
