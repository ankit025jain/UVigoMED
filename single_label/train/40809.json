{"id":40809,"title":"Comparative effects of the anti-platelet drugs, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and cilostazol on aspirin-induced gastric bleeding and damage in rats.","abstract":"The present study compared the effects of frequently used anti-platelet drugs, such as clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and cilostazol, on the gastric bleeding and ulcerogenic responses induced by intraluminal perfusion with 25 mM aspirin acidified with 25 mM HCl (acidified ASA) in rats.The stomach was perfused with acidified ASA at a rate of 0.4 ml/min for 60 min under urethane anesthesia, and gastric bleeding was measured as the concentration of hemoglobin in the luminal perfusate, which was collected every 15 min. Clopidogrel (10-100mg/kg), ticlopidine (10-300 mg/kg), or cilostazol (3-30 mg/kg) was given p.o. 24h or 90 min before the perfusion of acidified ASA, respectively.Perfusion of the stomach with acidified ASA alone led to slight bleeding and lesions in the stomach. The pretreatment with clopidogrel, even though it did not cause bleeding or damage by itself, dose-dependently increased the gastric bleeding and ulcerogenic responses induced by acidified ASA. Ticlopidine also aggravated the severity of damage by increasing gastric bleeding, and the effects of ticlopidine at 300 mg/kg were equivalent to those of clopidogrel at 100mg/kg. In contrast, cilostazol dose-dependently decreased gastric bleeding and damage in response to acidified ASA.These results demonstrated that clopidogrel and ticlopidine, P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, increased gastric bleeding and ulcerogenic responses to acidified ASA, to the same extent, while cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, suppressed these responses. Therefore, cilostazol may be safely used in dual anti-platelet therapy combined with ASA, without increasing the risk of gastric bleeding.","date":"2014-08-04","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984214","annotations":[{"name":"Clopidogrel","weight":0.906012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopidogrel"},{"name":"Hemoglobin","weight":0.874968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"},{"name":"Aspirin","weight":0.810129,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"},{"name":"Lumen (anatomy)","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Stomach","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.758052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Bleeding","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Peptic ulcer","weight":0.689906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer"},{"name":"Antiplatelet drug","weight":0.669322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplatelet_drug"},{"name":"Anesthesia","weight":0.634798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia"},{"name":"Acid","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.597468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Rat","weight":0.574584,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.460168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Hydrochloric acid","weight":0.442418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.355556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Phosphodiesterase","weight":0.350046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiesterase"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.220374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.169985,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Concentration","weight":0.134742,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration"},{"name":"P2Y receptor","weight":0.128109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2Y_receptor"},{"name":"Polyurethane","weight":0.127504,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane"},{"name":"Ticlopidine","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticlopidine"},{"name":"Cilostazol","weight":0.116968,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilostazol"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Immunosuppression","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression"},{"name":"Minute","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute"},{"name":"Internal bleeding","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_bleeding"},{"name":"P2Y12","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2Y12"}]}
