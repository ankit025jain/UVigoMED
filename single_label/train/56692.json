{"id":56692,"title":"Is there any evidence for the validity of diagnostic criteria used for accommodative and nonstrabismic binocular dysfunctions?","abstract":"To analyze the diagnostic criteria used in the scientific literature published in the past 25 years for accommodative and nonstrabismic binocular dysfunctions and to explore if the epidemiological analysis of diagnostic validity has been used to propose which clinical criteria should be used for diagnostic purposes.We carried out a systematic review of papers on accommodative and non-strabic binocular disorders published from 1986 to 2012 analysing the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and FRANCIS databases. We admitted original articles about diagnosis of these anomalies in any population. We identified 839 articles and 12 studies were included. The quality of included articles was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool.The review shows a wide range of clinical signs and cut-off points between authors. Only 3 studies (regarding accommodative anomalies) assessed diagnostic accuracy of clinical signs. Their results suggest using the accommodative amplitude and monocular accommodative facility for diagnosing accommodative insufficiency and a high positive relative accommodation for accommodative excess. The remaining 9 articles did not analyze diagnostic accuracy, assessing a diagnosis with the criteria the authors considered. We also found differences between studies in the way of considering patients' symptomatology. 3 studies of 12 analyzed, performed a validation of a symptom survey used for convergence insufficiency.Scientific literature reveals differences between authors according to diagnostic criteria for accommodative and nonstrabismic binocular dysfunctions. Diagnostic accuracy studies show that there is only certain evidence for accommodative conditions. For binocular anomalies there is only evidence about a validated questionnaire for convergence insufficiency with no data of diagnostic accuracy.","date":"2014-03-20","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646897","annotations":[{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Scientific literature","weight":0.768396,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literature"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Symptom","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.720487,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Systematic review","weight":0.697579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"},{"name":"Science","weight":0.587259,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science"},{"name":"MEDLINE","weight":0.554984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE"},{"name":"Blood test","weight":0.430984,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"},{"name":"Database","weight":0.333138,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.300374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Statistical survey","weight":0.175016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_survey"},{"name":"Literature","weight":0.148691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"},{"name":"Medical sign","weight":0.118447,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign"},{"name":"Congenital disorder","weight":0.118274,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.0849722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Accuracy and precision","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Validity (statistics)","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(statistics)"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","weight":0.0185779,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dysfunction"},{"name":"Hotel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel"},{"name":"Biological classification","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification"},{"name":"Amplitude","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude"}]}
