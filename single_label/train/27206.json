{"id":27206,"title":"[Peculiarities of arterial access in endovascular surgery in elderly patients].","abstract":"In elderly patients, when performing endovascular cathlabs manipulation the radial and cubital accesses is preferable. We propose a new arterial access on the back surface of the hand in the anatomical snuffbox. Artery catheterization of the hand in the anatomical snuffbox preserves intact the radial artery in the forearm for subsequent potential surgical interventions.","date":"2014-07-23","categories":"Cardiovascular Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051767","annotations":[{"name":"Radial artery","weight":0.812391,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_artery"},{"name":"Anatomy","weight":0.735174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.678452,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.66088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Forearm","weight":0.588645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forearm"},{"name":"Catheter","weight":0.365916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"},{"name":"Anatomical snuff box","weight":0.196208,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_snuff_box"},{"name":"Old age","weight":0.12095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age"},{"name":"Decorative box","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_box"},{"name":"Endovascular surgery","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endovascular_surgery"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Senior citizen","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_citizen"},{"name":"Joint manipulation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_manipulation"},{"name":"Fruit preserves","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves"}]}
