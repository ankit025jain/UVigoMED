{"id":89999,"title":"Features and management of intracranial mandibular condyle dislocation after trauma.","abstract":"Dislocation of the mandibular condyle into the middle cranial fossa is rare in clinics. It often occurs when the mouth is open wide during the injury. It causes restriction of mandibular motion, lower facial asymmetry, pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), etc.To introduce the features of intracranial mandibular condyle dislocation and discuss the management to this kind of trauma.In this paper, the authors present two cases, describing the diagnosis, surgical management, and 1-year follow-up evaluation. The results of the authors' treatment to intracranial mandibular condyle dislocation were satisfactory and stable, and no surgical complications were detected.Advanced imaging studies are mandatory for exact diagnosis and successful treatment of intracranial mandibular condyle dislocation, and individualized management is recommended.","date":"2014-03-25","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660649","annotations":[{"name":"Middle cranial fossa","weight":0.902058,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_cranial_fossa"},{"name":"Temporomandibular joint","weight":0.832513,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.825997,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Pain","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain"},{"name":"Skull","weight":0.785161,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"},{"name":"Joint","weight":0.776505,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint"},{"name":"Face","weight":0.769174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face"},{"name":"Trauma (medicine)","weight":0.75303,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"},{"name":"Human mandible","weight":0.690594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible"},{"name":"Condyle (anatomy)","weight":0.616083,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyle_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.606102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Cranial cavity","weight":0.567908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.395417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Joint dislocation","weight":0.214407,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.200374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Dislocation","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation"},{"name":"Condyloid process","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condyloid_process"},{"name":"Asymmetry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetry"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0168322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Management","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management"},{"name":"Paper","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper"}]}
