{"id":72971,"title":"The \"biker-glove\" pattern of segmental infantile hemangiomas on the hands and feet.","abstract":"Infantile hemangiomas (IH) on the extremities have not been systematically studied.We sought to describe the clinical characteristics and distribution patterns of IH affecting acral surfaces and to explore the relationship among these patterns, limb development, and IH pathogenesis.This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Photographic archives from 4 tertiary pediatric dermatology referral centers were searched for patients with IH larger than 1 cm and involving 1 or more digit. Hemangioma location, distribution, and morphologic subtype were recorded. Medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical data.In all, 73 patients were identified. The most common IH pattern resembled that of a \"biker glove\" (73%), followed by localized IH on the distal digits (14%), segmental IH extending over the distal digits (8%), and intermediate patterns (5%). Overall, 63% of acral IH were segmental, 26% indeterminate, and 11% localized. Five patients had associated structural anomalies. Complications were noted in 33% of cases.Limitations were retrospective study design; selection bias based on recall and photography; documentation and follow-up were not standardized across institutions; and treatment information may not reflect current approaches.Acral IH display specific patterns and are associated with a relatively high risk of ulceration.","date":"2014-08-16","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929885","annotations":[{"name":"Dermatology","weight":0.494375,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.318004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Peptic
