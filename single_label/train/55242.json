{"id":55242,"title":"Hydrophobic acrylic versus polymethyl methacrylate intraocular lens implantation following cataract surgery in the first year of life.","abstract":"To evaluate complication rates following implantation of hydrophobic acrylic versus polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) intraocular lens (IOL) with cataract surgery in infants.Records of children undergoing cataract surgery with IOL implantation in first year of life were retrospectively reviewed. Infants were divided into two groups--hydrophobic acrylic IOLs were implanted in group A, and PMMA IOLs in group B. Outcome measures included incidence of complications, additional surgical procedures, and refractive error changes.One hundred and thirteen eyes of 113 children (75 males) with mean age of 6.49?Â±?3.56 months were included. Group A included 62 eyes, and group B included 51 eyes. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age and axial length. There was no significant difference between the groups for incidence of posterior capsular opacification (PCO), pupillary membranes, glaucoma, fibrin on IOL surface or IOL malposition (p?=?0.09). Development of PCO was delayed in group A (p?=?0.049). Thirteen eyes of group A and 18 eyes of group B required additional surgical intervention (p?=?0.20) in the follow-up visits.Comparable complications may be expected in infants with PMMA and hydrophobic acrylic lenses. Children implanted with PMMA IOLs may require earlier surgical re-intervention for PCO.","date":"2014-09-04","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947548","annotations":[{"name":"Poly(methyl methacrylate)","weight":0.887319,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)"},{"name":"Glaucoma","weight":0.880102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"},{"name":"Intraocular lens","weight":0.872146,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lens"},{"name":"Cataract","weight":0.840845,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract"},{"name":"Refractive error","weight":0.809719,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_error"},{"name":"Lens (optics)","weight":0.686427,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.646633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pupil","weight":0.58717,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupil"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.56934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Refraction","weight":0.52288,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction"},{"name":"Cataract surgery","weight":0.521805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract_surgery"},{"name":"Implant (medicine)","weight":0.511364,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"},{"name":"Posterior capsular opacification","weight":0.276491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_capsular_opacification"},{"name":"Infant","weight":0.251498,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"},{"name":"Hydrophobe","weight":0.193164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Fibrin","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrin"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Optical axis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_axis"},{"name":"Error (baseball)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)"},{"name":"Capsule (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(botany)"},{"name":"Hundred (county subdivision)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)"},{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Anatomical terms of location","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"},{"name":"2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_FIFA_Beach_Soccer_World_Cup"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
