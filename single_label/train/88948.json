{"id":88948,"title":"Transection of the obturator nerve by an electrosurgical instrument and its immediate repair during laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy: a case report.","abstract":"Obturator nerve injury seldom occurs in gynecologic surgery. However, gynecologic oncologic surgery, including pelvic lymph node dissection, increases the risk of this type of injury. Microsurgical techniques are usually performed for the repair of the nerve injury. Herein the authors report a case of obturator nerve injury caused by an electrosurgical instrument during laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy, and its prompt repair by laparoscopic procedure in a 44-year-old patient with cervical cancer.","date":"2014-04-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24772921","annotations":[{"name":"Cervical cancer","weight":0.902167,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer"},{"name":"Lymph node","weight":0.887939,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node"},{"name":"Surgical oncology","weight":0.881384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_oncology"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Nervous system","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system"},{"name":"Gynaecology","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology"},{"name":"Lymph","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph"},{"name":"Laparoscopic surgery","weight":0.72334,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery"},{"name":"Cervix","weight":0.693579,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix"},{"name":"Lymphadenectomy","weight":0.689637,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphadenectomy"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.64757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Dissection","weight":0.334696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection"},{"name":"Spinal cord injury","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury"},{"name":"Case report","weight":0.20545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.190873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.144882,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Lymph node dissection","weight":0.138004,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node_dissection"},{"name":"Microsurgery","weight":0.131186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsurgery"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Obturator nerve","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obturator_nerve"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Neurotoxicity","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity"},{"name":"Procedure (term)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(term)"}]}
