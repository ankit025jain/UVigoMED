{"id":82688,"title":"A rare case of localised oral amyloid of the labial mucosa.","abstract":"Amyloidosis is often a systemic process, and localised oral amyloidosis is rare. We present the case of a young woman with amyloid deposition in the labial mucosa of her lower lip. Systemic involvement was excluded by comprehensive assessment at the UK Amyloidosis Centre. Of 40 previously reported cases of localised oral amyloidosis we found only one that was limited to the labial mucosa.
