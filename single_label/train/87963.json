{"id":87963,"title":"Shoulder problems in overhead sports. Part I - biomechanics of throwing.","abstract":"The article discusses the biomechanical processes that occur during an overhead throw. This activity is highly specialized and requires full and proper function from the shoulder joint. It consists of active and passive stabilization and synchronous work of the accelerating and decelerating muscles. The process of the overhead throw can be divided into several phases that differ from each other in biomechanical parameters and involvement of specific muscles.","date":"2014-06-19","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941418","annotations":[{"name":"Biomechanics","weight":0.184485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics"},{"name":"Muscle","weight":0.125733,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"},{"name":"Acceleration","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Sport","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"},{"name":"Shoulder problem","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_problem"},{"name":"Shoulder","weight":0.0180213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder"},{"name":"Synchronization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization"},{"name":"Process (computing)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"},{"name":"Passivation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation"},{"name":"Track and field","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field"},{"name":"Active safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_safety"},{"name":"List of Naruto chapters (Part I)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Naruto_chapters_(Part_I)"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Glenohumeral joint","weight":0.0140524,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenohumeral_joint"}]}
