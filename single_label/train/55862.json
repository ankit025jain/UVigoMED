{"id":55862,"title":"Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome associated with human herpes virus-6 rhomboencephalitis.","abstract":"Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is characterized by opsoclonus and arrhythmic-action myoclonus that predominantly involves the trunk, limbs, and head. Human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) can rarely cause encephalitis in immunocompetent children and adults. Here we report on a case of OMS associated with HHV-6 rhomboencephalitis. HHV-6 infection should be considered in OMS adults and detection of cell-free viral DNA, indicative of active infection, is mandatory in such cases.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Eye Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793510","annotations":[{"name":"Herpesviridae","weight":0.889496,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae"},{"name":"Encephalitis","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis"},{"name":"DNA","weight":0.801553,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"},{"name":"Virus","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.670684,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.666263,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Myoclonus","weight":0.654808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoclonus"},{"name":"Immunocompetence","weight":0.624187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunocompetence"},{"name":"Herpes simplex","weight":0.602943,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.50255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Human herpesvirus 6","weight":0.047465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_herpesvirus_6"},{"name":"Limb (anatomy)","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.0318009,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Opsoclonus","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsoclonus"},{"name":"Trunk (anatomy)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Orbital_Maneuvering_System"},{"name":"Higher heating value","weight":0.0162839,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_heating_value"}]}
