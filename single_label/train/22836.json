{"id":22836,"title":"Risk factors for 1-year relapse of pulmonary tuberculosis treated with a 6-month daily regimen.","abstract":"We aimed to identify the 1-year relapse rate and risk factors for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) treated with a 6-month daily regimen.A total of 317 patients with pan-susceptible pulmonary TB who completed a 6-month daily course of treatment [2HRZ(E)/4HR(E)] were retrospectively analyzed.The mean age was 50.0 Â± 16.8 years and men were predominant (61.2%). All of 137 adults tested for HIV were negative. Six (1.9%) cases relapsed within one year. Relapse rate was higher in patients with a positive culture after 2 months of treatment (10.0%, p = 0.049) and in patients with both a positive culture after 2 months of treatment and cavitation on initial chest radiograph (18.2%, p = 0.015), whereas relapse rate in patients with cavitation alone was comparable to that of the total population (2.7%). Among various risk factors known to increase risk of relapse, the combined variable of cavitation and positive culture at 2 months (OR = 15.56, 95% CI 2.56-98.71, p = 0.003) was only associated with increased relapse rate in a multivariate analysis.Even with a 6-month daily treatment regimen throughout the intensive and continuation phases, the relapse rate was unacceptably high in patients with both a positive culture at 2 months of treatment and cavitation on baseline chest radiography. Intensification of treatment, such as an extension of treatment duration, should be considered in this category of patients.","date":"2014-03-18","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518046","annotations":[{"name":"Tuberculosis","weight":0.904431,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis"},{"name":"HIV","weight":0.822179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.606559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Radiography","weight":0.492908,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiography"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.457965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Chest radiograph","weight":0.260134,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.18053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Population","weight":0.0543856,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.0527304,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Cavitation","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Chest","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest"},{"name":"Relapse","weight":0.0200776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Multivariate random variable","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_random_variable"},{"name":"HIV test","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_test"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Variable (mathematics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Hormone response element","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_response_element"},{"name":"Extension (kinesiology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(kinesiology)"},{"name":"Oregon","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Phase (matter)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(matter)"},{"name":"Time","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time"},{"name":"Continuation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation"},{"name":"Uncial 049","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_049"}]}
