{"id":67444,"title":"[Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)].","abstract":"In merely a short period of time the comprehension of castration-resistant prostate cancer has evolved. It is now possible to clearly outline the exact definition and variance of the disease pattern. A wealth of new effective agents can be applied to extend the patient's life span and improve the quality of life. An understanding of the pharmacodynamics and side effects of each substance is of utmost importance for the practical application. In order to use these new medicines in a differentiated manner urologists require continuous education. The evaluation of response to treatment has yet to be satisfyingly verified. Molecular markers still need to be developed and evaluated.","date":"2014-03-11","categories":"Male Urogenital Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615465","annotations":[{"name":"Quality of life","weight":0.818686,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801318,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Adverse effect","weight":0.733029,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical drug","weight":0.728515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.705743,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Life expectancy","weight":0.698596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.658237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pharmacodynamics","weight":0.590567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.589597,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Urology","weight":0.584836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology"},{"name":"Prostate cancer","weight":0.528409,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer"},{"name":"Prostate","weight":0.505093,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"},{"name":"Chemical substance","weight":0.378669,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance"},{"name":"Traditional Chinese medicine","weight":0.355602,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.328679,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Education","weight":0.319896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"},{"name":"Molecule","weight":0.246474,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"},{"name":"Variance","weight":0.112878,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0565064,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Wealth","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth"},{"name":"Continuing education","weight":0.0280659,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_education"},{"name":"Computer software","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software"},{"name":"Continuous function","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"},{"name":"Definition","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Order (biology)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)"},{"name":"Span (architecture)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_(architecture)"},{"name":"Pattern","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern"},{"name":"Short film","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film"},{"name":"Biomarker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker"},{"name":"Molecular marker","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_marker"}]}
