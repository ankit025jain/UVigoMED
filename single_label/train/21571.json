{"id":21571,"title":"16S rRNA sequencing as a diagnostic tool in the identification of culture-negative endocarditis in surgically treated patients.","abstract":"Infective endocarditis (IE) is a worldwide problem, and at least one-third of cases are culture-negative despite the use of appropriate laboratory techniques.A broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by single-strand sequencing for 26 surgically removed heart valves from patients with culture-negative endocarditis who had undergone valve repair or replacement.Two of the 26 patients were PCR-positive, and sequencing of the amplicon identified the etiological agent. Gram-stained smears of the heart valves were positive in both cases. Three of the remaining 24 cases which were negative by PCR also showed the presence of micro-organisms in Gram-stained smears.The study results emphasize that, in suspected IE cases when there is no growth in culture, a combination of microscopy and 16S rRNA sequencing can be used to identify the pathogen in excised valvular tissue.","date":"2014-03-06","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24597408","annotations":[{"name":"Polymerase chain reaction","weight":0.859999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Endocarditis","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis"},{"name":"Etiology","weight":0.805036,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Pathogen","weight":0.799199,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.793722,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Infective endocarditis","weight":0.759996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infective_endocarditis"},{"name":"Microscopy","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.738937,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.72914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.691549,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.669299,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Heart valve","weight":0.544109,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_valve"},{"name":"Laboratory","weight":0.282633,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory"},{"name":"Epilepsy","weight":0.250237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy"},{"name":"Sequencing","weight":0.16445,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"16S ribosomal RNA","weight":0.0654273,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Ribosomal RNA","weight":0.0540614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA"},{"name":"Chain reaction","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction"},{"name":"Chemical reaction","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction"},{"name":"Polymerase","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Valve","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve"},{"name":"Polymer","weight":0.0205078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"},{"name":"Indo-European languages","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages"},{"name":"Ribosomal DNA","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_DNA"},{"name":"Laboratory techniques","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_techniques"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"}]}
