{"id":49625,"title":"Modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors as predictors of dementia death: pooling of ten general population-based cohort studies.","abstract":"With drug treatment for dementia being of limited effectiveness, the role of primary prevention, in particular the predictive value of modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors, may warrant exploration. The evidence base is, however, characterised by discordant findings and is modest in size. Accordingly, we examined the association of modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors with dementia death.We pooled raw data from 10 UK general population-based prospective cohort studies within the context of an individual participant meta-analysis.A total of 103,764 men and women were followed up for a mean of 8 years giving rise to 443 dementia-related deaths and 2612 cardiovascular disease deaths. Cardiovascular disease mortality was, as anticipated, associated with the full range of risk factors under study, including raised blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, physical inactivity. By contrast, dementia death was related to very few of the cardiovascular disease risk factors: of those classified as modifiable, only smoking was associated with a raised risk and higher levels of non-HDL with a lower risk.In the present individual participant meta-analysis, there was limited evidence that cardiovascular disease risk factors were related to dementia death.","date":"2014-06-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886432","annotations":[{"name":"Cardiovascular disease","weight":0.870996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diabetes mellitus","weight":0.834159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus"},{"name":"Dementia","weight":0.814954,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia"},{"name":"Smoking","weight":0.794971,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking"},{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.791078,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Meta-analysis","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"},{"name":"Blood","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood"},{"name":"Risk factor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor"},{"name":"Blood pressure","weight":0.72365,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"},{"name":"Preventive medicine","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_medicine"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.7194,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.717419,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Evidence-based medicine","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"},{"name":"Substance dependence","weight":0.712861,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.705583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Drug","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.663022,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Sedentary lifestyle","weight":0.610337,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle"},{"name":"Cohort (statistics)","weight":0.555715,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.460335,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"United Kingdom","weight":0.368379,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.238934,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Base (chemistry)","weight":0.155758,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.141289,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Exploration","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration"},{"name":"Association (statistics)","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(statistics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0311179,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"General officer","weight":0.0157947,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer"},{"name":"Physics","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"},{"name":"Primary school","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school"},{"name":"Taxonomy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy"},{"name":"Range (biology)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"}]}
