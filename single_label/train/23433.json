{"id":23433,"title":"Single nucleotide repeat analysis of B. anthracis isolates in Canada through comparison of pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing.","abstract":"Several technology platforms have been developed to resolve the phylogenetic placement of B. anthracis. However, these methods lack the resolution to identify differences between closely related strains within an outbreak due to the highly clonal nature of B. anthracis. Single Nucleotide Repeats (SNRs) are a type of rapidly evolving genetic marker that can be used to track epidemiological distribution in the event of an outbreak. Four SNR targets were used to detect and type 35 B. anthracis isolates in our collection; 18 from across Canada obtained between 1972 and 2005 and 17 from the 2006 Anthrax outbreak in north eastern Saskatchewan. A control sequence was developed for pyrosequencing which yielded consistent and accurate reads of SNRs. However, when DNA from the isolates was tested using pyrosequencing the results were inconsistent and did not reflect the number of SNRs obtained by Sanger sequencing. The SNR numbers derived from the Sanger sequencing show two of the four SNR loci could provide information on subtype, whereas the other two were not discriminatory. There is variation in SNRs between strains isolated from different outbreaks, the subset of 2006 outbreak strains showed very little difference in SNR number, and thus suggests low diversity among the strains sampled from the same outbreak.
