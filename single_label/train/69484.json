{"id":69484,"title":"Epithelioid hemangioma of the testis.","abstract":"Testicular hemangioma is a very rare benign vascular neoplasm, there are only less than 30 cases of testicular hemangiomas reported in the literature. We report a case of epithelioid hemangioma of the testis in a 53-year-old man who presented with painless mass in the right testis. An orchiectomy was performed, The 1 cm tumor was composed of prominent proliferation of small, capillary-sized vessels lined by plump, epithelioid endothelial cells. Immunohistochemically, the epithelioid endothelial cells reacted with antibodies to factor VIII-related antigen, CD31, CD34 and Vimentin, but not CK, EMA, CEA, S-100 and CD68. Although it is a rare tumor, we should be aware of it and avoid confusion with other vascular neoplasm.
