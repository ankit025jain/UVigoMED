{"id":87589,"title":"Functional independence in teenage patients with burns.","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to assess the functional independence of teenagers undergoing a process of rehabilitation. A cross-sectional study was carried out on a sample of 63 teenagers, aged 12 to 20, who had suffered burns and were going through a process of rehabilitation, with the application of the Functional Independence Measurement (FIM). The data was analysed using descriptive statistics and also a test for comparison of means (Student's t-test), as well as Cronbach's reliability test. There was proof of a high degree of independence in FIM. Analysis of the location of the burn and also the performance of work and/or study activities showed these not to interfere with functional independence. The results indicate the reliability of the instruments applied, making it possible to conduct an assessment of the functional independence of the teenagers during the rehabilitation process.","date":"2014-07-29","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075387","annotations":[{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.613397,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.480203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.423377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.16053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0802797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Reliability engineering","weight":0.0411186,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering"},{"name":"Musical instrument","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument"},{"name":"Academic degree","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree"},{"name":"Application software","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software"},{"name":"Adolescence","weight":0.0276227,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence"},{"name":"Descriptive statistics","weight":0.0274275,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics"},{"name":"Functional programming","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"},{"name":"Interference (wave propagation)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"},{"name":"Finnish markka","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_markka"},{"name":"Sample (statistics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Independence","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Physical therapy","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy"},{"name":"Mathematical proof","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof"}]}
