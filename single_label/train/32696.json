{"id":32696,"title":"[Bilateral pulmonary artery banding using ligation clips and facile Norwood-Glenn procedure].","abstract":"Bilateral pulmonary artery banding( BPAB), though a less-invasive surgical option for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), entails considerable risk of residual pulmonary artery stenosis after de-banding. Autologous aortic reconstruction in Norwood procedure is attractive in terms of growth potential, but technically demanding. To overcome these drawbacks, we modified the 2 techniques. Eight patients with HLHS underwent BPAB whereby ligation clips were half-closed into rhombic shape to deform bilateral pulmonary arteries. The arterial duct was kept patent by prostaglandin E1 infusion. One patient died of sepsis( age 8 months), while the 7 survivors underwent Norwood-Glenn procedure. Both pulmonary arteries were excised from the pulmonary trunk with minimal cuffs. Resultant defect in the pulmonary trunk was longitudinally closed. After arterial duct excision, pulmonary trunk-to descending aorta continuity was reconstructed by end-to-end anastomosis. Ascending aorta-to-aortic arch complex was anastomosed to the pulmonary trunk in a side-to-side fashion. After bilateral pulmonary artery continuity was reconstructed, Glenn anastomosis was made. One patient died of pneumonia(age 5 months). Currently, the 6 surviving patients(age 4?30 months), enjoy good health. Four of them have completed Fontan procedure. Our modified techniques are facile, reproducible, and pose low risk of residual pulmonary artery stenosis or aortic stenosis.","date":"2014-06-11","categories":"Congenital Hereditary and Neonatal
