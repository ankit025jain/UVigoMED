{"id":21585,"title":"A phytopathogenic cysteine peptidase from latex of wild rubber vine Cryptostegia grandiflora.","abstract":"A 24,118 Da (MALDI-TOF) cysteine peptidase (EC 3.4.22.16) was purified from the latex extract of Cryptostegia grandiflora by two chromatographic steps involving ion exchange and Reverse-phase HPLC. The purified protein (Cg24-I) exhibits a single band profile following reduced SDS-PAGE and a unique amino terminal sequence, 1VPASIDWREKGTVL14, that is similar to other plant cysteine peptidases. Cg24-I displayed optimal proteolytic activity at pH 8.0 with 25 mM phosphate buffer. The proteolytic activity was inhibited with 0.2 mM E-64 and 1 mM iodoacetamide and was stimulated with 1 mM DTT. Cg24-I fully inhibited spore germination of phytopathogenic fungi Fusarium solani at a dose of 28.1 ?g/mL. Its toxicity involves the membrane permeabilization of spores as probed by propidium iodide uptake. These results show that latex peptidases are part of the plant's defensive strategy against phytopathogens and that they most likely act synergistically with other recognized defensive proteins.","date":"2014-03-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24596120","annotations":[{"name":"Fungus","weight":0.863012,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"},{"name":"Spore","weight":0.828974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore"},{"name":"Cysteine","weight":0.821349,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine"},{"name":"Biological membrane","weight":0.812922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_membrane"},{"name":"Protein","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"},{"name":"Ion","weight":0.802374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"},{"name":"Chromatography","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"PH","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"},{"name":"High-performance liquid chromatography","weight":0.798641,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography"},{"name":"N-terminus","weight":0.7902,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-terminus"},{"name":"Proteolysis","weight":0.78661,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis"},{"name":"Molar concentration","weight":0.782628,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration"},{"name":"Semipermeable membrane","weight":0.760547,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane"},{"name":"Toxicity","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"},{"name":"Protease","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease"},{"name":"Natural rubber","weight":0.738783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber"},{"name":"Phosphate","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"},{"name":"Latex","weight":0.731783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"},{"name":"Ion exchange","weight":0.686457,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_exchange"},{"name":"Atomic mass unit","weight":0.681894,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"},{"name":"Plant pathology","weight":0.672999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_pathology"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.64932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Amine","weight":0.632218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine"},{"name":"Buffer solution","weight":0.5822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_solution"},{"name":"Germination","weight":0.566914,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germination"},{"name":"Fusarium","weight":0.560932,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium"},{"name":"Cysteine protease","weight":0.447515,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine_protease"},{"name":"Water purification","weight":0.366556,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_purification"},{"name":"Nucleic acid sequence","weight":0.314095,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.150554,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Iodide","weight":0.134165,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodide"},{"name":"Synergy","weight":0.106224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy"},{"name":"Vine","weight":0.0641298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine"},{"name":"Extract","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract"},{"name":"Dithiothreitol","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithiothreitol"},{"name":"Iodoacetamide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodoacetamide"},{"name":"EC number","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EC_number"},{"name":"Mathematical optimization","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"}]}
