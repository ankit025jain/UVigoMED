{"id":14186,"title":"Detection of activated platelets in a mouse model of carotid artery thrombosis with 18 F-labeled single-chain antibodies.","abstract":"Activated platelets are key players in thrombosis and inflammation. We previously generated single-chain antibodies (scFv) against ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS) on the highly abundant platelet glycoprotein integrin receptor IIb/IIIa. The aim of this study was the construction and characterisation of a novel (18)F PET radiotracer based on this antibody.ScFv(anti-LIBS) and control antibody mut-scFv were reacted with N-succinimidyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate (S[(18)F]FB). Radiolabeled scFv was incubated with in vitro formed platelet clots and injected into mice with FeCl(3) induced thrombus in the left carotid artery. Clots were imaged in the PET scanner and amount of radioactivity measured using an ionization chamber and image analysis. Assessment of vessel injury as well as the biodistribution of the radiolabeled scFv was studied.After incubation with increasing concentrations of (18)F-scFv(anti-LIBS) clots had retained significantly higher amounts of radioactivity compared to clots incubated with radiolabeled (18)F-mut-scFv (13.3 ± 3.8 vs. 3.6 ± 1 KBq, p < 0.05, n = 9, decay corrected). In the in vivo experiments we found an high uptake of the tracer in the injured vessel compared with the non-injured vessel, with 12.6 ± 4.7% injected dose per gram (ID/g) uptake in the injured vessel and 3.7 ± 0.9% ID/g in the non-injured vessel 5 minutes after injection (p < 0.05, n = 6).Our results show that the novel antibody radiotracer (18)F-scFv(anti-LIBS) is useful for the sensitive detection of activated platelets and thrombosis.We describe the first (18)F variant of a scFv(anti-LIBS) against activated platelets. This diagnostic agent could provide a powerful tool for the assessment of acute thrombosis and inflammation in patients in the future.","date":"2014-02-18","categories":"Animal Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440583","annotations":[{"name":"Integrin","weight":0.888529,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin"},{"name":"Glycoprotein","weight":0.819261,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoprotein"},{"name":"Platelet","weight":0.80522,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet"},{"name":"Antibody","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.776635,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Positron emission tomography","weight":0.757559,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"},{"name":"Inflammation","weight":0.751806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Receptor (biochemistry)","weight":0.713139,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Thrombus","weight":0.694501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.692698,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Thrombosis","weight":0.685832,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis"},{"name":"Injection (medicine)","weight":0.596657,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)"},{"name":"Radioactive decay","weight":0.587439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"},{"name":"Radioactive tracer","weight":0.581468,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"},{"name":"Isotopic labeling","weight":0.517773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_labeling"},{"name":"Medical imaging","weight":0.508649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.504701,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Common carotid artery","weight":0.444591,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carotid_artery"},{"name":"Dose (biochemistry)","weight":0.437647,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose_(biochemistry)"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.371614,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.314732,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Blood vessel","weight":0.255405,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"},{"name":"Gram","weight":0.159241,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram"},{"name":"Ionization","weight":0.110757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"},{"name":"Experiment","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment"},{"name":"Binding site","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site"},{"name":"Molecular binding","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_binding"},{"name":"Animal testing on rodents","weight":0.0377168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing_on_rodents"},{"name":"Image analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_analysis"},{"name":"Single-chain variable fragment","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-chain_variable_fragment"},{"name":"Biodistribution","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodistribution"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Incubation period","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period"},{"name":"Image","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image"},{"name":"Image scanner","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner"},{"name":"Novel","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"}]}
