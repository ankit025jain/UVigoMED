{"id":42073,"title":"Five-year clinical outcome and patency rate of device-dependent venous grafts after clampless OPCAB with PAS-port automated proximal anastomosis: the PAPA Study.","abstract":"To evaluate long-term clinical performance and angiographic patency of automated proximal venous anastomoses following clampless coronary artery bypass (C-CAB).Observational study in patients submitted for isolated C-CAB and at least one proximal aortosaphenous anastomosis performed with an automated connector (Cardica PAS-Port) including 152 consecutive patients (165 devices and 199 device-dependent distal anastomoses), with LVEF?>?30% and saphenous vein diameter of 4-6?mm. Clinical follow-up was 96% complete (4101/4269 pt-months). Graft patency rate was assessed with 64-slice CT-scan or coronary angiography. Freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was reported as actuarial probability with 95% confidence limits and venous graft patency as actual rate at every year interval.Early operative mortality was 1.9%; incidence of neurologic injury was zero. Freedom from MACCE was 92.7?±?2.1 at one year and 85.2?±?4.8 at five years. The actual patency rate of device-dependent venous grafts was 90%, 85%, 84%, 84%, and 93% for one-, two-, three-, four-, and five-year-old grafts, respectively.The device is a well-performing system for proximal anastomoses. The incidence of neurologic complications seems to be reduced with this clampless approach. The high patency rate is stable over time.","date":"2014-05-30","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24883445","annotations":[{"name":"Incidence (epidemiology)","weight":0.771398,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)"},{"name":"Angiography","weight":0.762764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"},{"name":"Vein","weight":0.741322,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein"},{"name":"Neurology","weight":0.72023,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Coronary catheterization","weight":0.703373,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_catheterization"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.677151,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Coronary artery bypass surgery","weight":0.632642,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery"},{"name":"Artery","weight":0.62749,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery"},{"name":"Coronary circulation","weight":0.61912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_circulation"},{"name":"Ejection fraction","weight":0.613132,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.533922,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Anastomosis","weight":0.490493,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastomosis"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.419691,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.369348,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Graft (surgery)","weight":0.329224,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_(surgery)"},{"name":"Proximal","weight":0.284542,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal"},{"name":"Complication (medicine)","weight":0.263573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(medicine)"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.260052,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.214159,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Cerebrovascular disease","weight":0.172927,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease"},{"name":"Diameter","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter"},{"name":"Millimetre","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimetre"},{"name":"Probability","weight":0.0318302,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"},{"name":"0 (number)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)"},{"name":"199","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/199"},{"name":"Machine","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Electrical connector","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_connector"},{"name":"Automation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation"},{"name":"Performance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance"},{"name":"Cutting","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting"},{"name":"Clinical governance","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_governance"},{"name":"Five-year survival rate","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_survival_rate"},{"name":"British Amateur Press Association (comics fandom)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Amateur_Press_Association_(comics_fandom)"},{"name":"Actuarial science","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science"},{"name":"Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultative_Committee_of_Accountancy_Bodies"},{"name":"Political corruption","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption"},{"name":"Great saphenous vein","weight":0.0141203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_saphenous_vein"}]}
