{"id":44169,"title":"The use of double lasso, fully covered self-expandable metal stents with new \"anchoring flap\" system in the treatment of benign biliary diseases.","abstract":"Many benign biliary diseases (BBD) can be treated with fully covered, self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) but stent migration occurs in up to 35.7 %. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the rate of, safety and effectiveness and stent migration of a new biliary FCSEMS with an anti-migration flap (FCSEMS-AF) in patients with BBD.This was a prospective study from four Italian referral endoscopy centers of 32 consecutive patients (10 females and 22 males; mean age: 60.1 ± 14.8 years; range: 32-84 years) with BBD who were offered endoscopic placement of a FCSEMS-AF as first-line therapy.Were 24 strictures and 8 leaks. Stent placement was technically successful in 32/32 patients (100 %). Immediate clinical improvement was seen in all 32 patients (100 %). One late stent migration occurred (3.3 %). FCSEMS-AF were removed from 30 of the 32 patients (93.7 %) at a mean (± SD) of 124.4 ± 84.2 days (range: 10-386 days) after placement. All patients remained clinically and biochemically well at 1- and 3-month follow-up. One patient (3.3 %) with a post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy stricture developed distal stent migration at 125 days.This new FCSEMS with anti-migration flap seems to be a safe and effective first-line treatment option for patients with BBD.","date":"2014-08-28","categories":"Digestive System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748231","annotations":[{"name":"Endoscopy","weight":0.82025,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscopy"},{"name":"Stent","weight":0.798873,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.754651,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Bile duct","weight":0.722654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.717472,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.669249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Cholecystectomy","weight":0.630976,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystectomy"},{"name":"Distal","weight":0.574033,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal"},{"name":"Italy","weight":0.385168,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.353725,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.222191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Metal","weight":0.127545,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"},{"name":"Biochemistry","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry"},{"name":"Lasso","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso"},{"name":"Arithmetic mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"},{"name":"South Dakota","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota"},{"name":"24 (TV series)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Immediate Records","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Records"},{"name":"Anchoring","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"},{"name":"Flap (aircraft)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)"},{"name":"News leak","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_leak"},{"name":"Option (finance)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"},{"name":"Human migration","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"}]}
