{"id":81757,"title":"Regression of oral lichenoid lesions after replacement of  dental restorations.","abstract":"The aim of the study was to determine the prognosis and to evaluate the regression of lichenoid contact reactions (LCR) and oral lichen planus (OLP) after replacement of dental restorative materials suspected as causing the lesions. Forty-four referred patients with oral lesions participated in a follow-up study that was initiated an average of 6 years after the first examination at the Department of Odontology, i.e. the baseline examination. The patients underwent odontological clinical examination and answered a questionnaire with questions regarding dental health, medical and psychological health, and treatments undertaken from baseline to follow-up. After exchange of dental materials, regression of oral lesions was significantly higher among patients with LCR than with OLP. As no cases with OLP regressed after an exchange of materials, a proper diagnosis has to be made to avoid unnecessary exchanges of intact restorations on patients with OLP.","date":"2014-05-19","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843865","annotations":[{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.821532,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Lesion","weight":0.745988,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.73221,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Mental health","weight":0.629162,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health"},{"name":"Medicine","weight":0.603484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine"},{"name":"Physical examination","weight":0.563184,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.54351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Psychology","weight":0.54001,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.491164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Mouth","weight":0.443527,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"},{"name":"Health","weight":0.325361,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health"},{"name":"Test (assessment)","weight":0.223314,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_(assessment)"},{"name":"Dental restoration","weight":0.196088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"},{"name":"Mucosal lichen planus","weight":0.144746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucosal_lichen_planus"},{"name":"Questionnaire","weight":0.129065,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire"},{"name":"Lichen planus","weight":0.0342852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen_planus"},{"name":"Lichen","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen"},{"name":"Dental restorative materials","weight":0.0290048,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restorative_materials"},{"name":"Clinical psychology","weight":0.0250212,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology"},{"name":"Regression analysis","weight":0.0203278,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis"},{"name":"Average","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average"},{"name":"Our Lady Peace","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_Peace"}]}
