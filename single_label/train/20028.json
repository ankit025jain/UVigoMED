{"id":20028,"title":"Protein kinase C-? mediates sepsis-induced activation of complement 5a and urokinase-type plasminogen activator signaling in macrophages.","abstract":"Activations of the complement C5a (C5a) and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) are commonly seen together during sepsis. However, the mechanism linking these two important pathways remains elusive.We used the C57BL/6Â J mice model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation puncture (CLP) procedure, injected anti-C5aR or rottlerin through the tail vein to neutralize C5aR or PKC-?, and then isolated peritoneal macrophages. Total RNA was isolated from the cells and analyzed by quantitative PCR.Our study revealed that neutralizing C5aR markedly inhibited sepsis-induced uPA receptor (uPAR) expression and its downstream signaling in macrophage. Similarly, neutralizing uPAR suppressed sepsis activation of C5a signaling. Importantly, inhibition of PKC-? largely blocked sepsis-induced expression of C5aR and uPAR.Our study demonstrates a crosstalk between the complement C5a signaling and the fibrinolytic uPA pathways, which may depend on each other to maintain their expression and signaling, and reveals a central role of PKC-? in mediating sepsis-induced activation of these pathways.","date":"2014-06-10","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682410","annotations":[{"name":"Protein kinase
