Blood and urine samples were collected for transferrin, urea and creatinine measurements. Samples, SOFA score and protein-calorie intake values were repeated on days 7 and 15. Patients (n:120) were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group I received 30 g/day IV glutamine, group II received 30 g/day enteral glutamine, group III received 15 g/day IV and 15 g/day enteral glutamine. Group IV received only enteral feeding as a control group. Transferrin levels decreased in group IV (p<0.01 0-7 days, p<0.01 7-15 days, p<0.01 0-15 days). Nitrogen balance levels were highest in group IV when compared with group I (p<0.05, p<0.001), group II (p<0.001), and group III (p<0.05, p<0.001) on days 7-15. Creatinine/height indexes increased in group I (p<0.001), group II (p<0.001), group III (p<0.001), and group IV (p<0.05) on day 15. In group III the creatinine/height index was higher than in groups I and II (p<0.05). In group IV, creatinine/height index was lower than in group I (p<0.01) and group II (p<0.001). Protein-calorie intake in group IV was higher than others on day 7 (p<0.05). SOFA scores of group IV were higher than the other groups on day 15 (p<0.05). This study demonstrated, that combined route of gln supplementation resulted in the most positive outcome to transferrin, creatine/height index and nitrogen balance (on days 7 and 15) during the catabolic phase of septic patients with malnutrition.
