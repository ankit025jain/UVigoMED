{"id":4969,"title":"Negative pressure wound therapy for partial-thickness burns.","abstract":"A burn wound is a complex and evolving injury, with both local and systemic consequences. Burn treatments include a variety of dressings, as well as newer strategies, such as negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), which, by means of a suction force that drains excess fluids from the burn, tries to promote the wound healing process and minimise progression of the burn wound.To assess the effectiveness of NPWT for people with partial-thickness burns.We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 04 September 2014); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 8).All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of NPWT for partial-thickness burns.Two review authors used standardised forms, and extracted the data independently. We assessed each trial for risk of bias, and resolved differences by discussion.One RCT, that was an interim report, satisfied the inclusion criteria. We undertook a narrative synthesis of results, as the absence of data and poor reporting precluded us from carrying out any formal statistical analysis. The trial was at high risk of bias.There was not enough evidence available to permit any conclusions to be drawn regarding the use of NPWT for treatment of partial-thickness burn wounds.","date":"2015-01-02","categories":"Wounds and Injuries","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25500895","annotations":[{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Pressure","weight":0.732308,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"},{"name":"Randomized controlled trial","weight":0.709756,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.705071,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Wound","weight":0.663374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.653213,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Force","weight":0.558353,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"},{"name":"Burn","weight":0.530773,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn"},{"name":"Injury","weight":0.485077,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.39558,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.38849,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"Suction","weight":0.347891,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suction"},{"name":"Cochrane Collaboration","weight":0.306422,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration"},{"name":"Fluid","weight":0.273822,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid"},{"name":"Healing","weight":0.20764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing"},{"name":"Safety","weight":0.146091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety"},{"name":"Cochrane Library","weight":0.136645,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library"},{"name":"Bedsore","weight":0.129429,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedsore"},{"name":"Wound healing","weight":0.125451,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing"},{"name":"Pleural effusion","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_effusion"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.107046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Evidence","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence"},{"name":"Bias","weight":0.089122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"},{"name":"Chemical synthesis","weight":0.0824005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis"},{"name":"Library","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Negative pressure wound therapy","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_pressure_wound_therapy"},{"name":"Trial","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Central America","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Strategy","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy"},{"name":"2014","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014"},{"name":"Chord progression","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression"},{"name":"Variety (botany)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)"},{"name":"Try","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Try"},{"name":"Dressing (medical)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressing_(medical)"},{"name":"Interim","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim"},{"name":"Electric charge","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge"},{"name":"Subset","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"},{"name":"Narrative","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative"},{"name":"Systemic disease","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_disease"}]}
