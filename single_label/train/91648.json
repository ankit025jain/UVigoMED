{"id":91648,"title":"Surgical and endovascular treatment of extracranial carotid artery aneurysms: early and long-term results of a single center.","abstract":"To evaluate early and long-term results of surgical and endovascular therapy of extracranial carotid artery aneurysms.A retrospective study was conducted of 26 aneurysms in 25 patients (19 men and 6 women) who underwent surgery between 1993 and 2010: 18 were atherosclerotic, 3 were from arteritis, 1 was a relapsing mycotic aneurysm from previous carotid surgery, and 4 were posttraumatic. A neurologic event was the presenting symptom in 10 cases (7 transient ischemic attacks, 3 strokes); 13 patients were asymptomatic and a cranial nerve dysfunction (hoarseness) was present in 2; fever was present in 1. A total of 15 aneurysms, located on the carotid bifurcation (CB), were resected and an end-to-end carotid anastomosis was performed. In 6 patients with CB aneurysms, a vein graft was applied in 5, and a polytetrafluoroethylene graft in the other. Aneurysmorrhaphy and a vein patch was the procedure in 2 patients with an aneurysm of the CB. One of these 2 patients had a relapsing mycotic pseudoaneurysm and was treated initially with a vein patch, subsequently with a vein graft, and lastly with a carotid artery ligation. Three common carotid artery aneurysms from arteritis were treated under local anesthesia through implantation of a Viabahn endoprosthesis.A perioperative minor stroke occurred in 1 patient (3.8%) because of intentional ligation of the internal carotid artery from a relapsing mycotic aneurysm, already treated with a vein patch and subsequently with a vein bypass. No permanent cranial nerve injuries were recorded; transient cranial nerve injuries were observed in 2 patients.Surgical treatment is feasible, with an acceptable rate of stroke and cranial nerve injuries, especially when the aneurysm is located on the common carotid artery and carotid bulb. Endovascular therapy is a fascinating option, with satisfactory early and long-term results, and should always be considered when treating aneurysms located in the distal internal carotid artery and when the patient is not a good candidate for open surgery.","date":"2014-03-26","categories":"Wounds and
