{"id":62202,"title":"Arsenic disulfide induced apoptosis and concurrently promoted erythroid differentiation in cytokine-dependent myelodysplastic syndrome-progressed leukemia cell line F-36p with complex karyotype including monosomy 7.","abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia progressed from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS/AML) is generally incurable with poor prognosis for complex karyotype including monosomy 7 (-7). Qinghuang Powder (, QHP), which includes Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis) and Xiong Huang (realgar) in the formula, is effective in treating MDS or MDS/AML even with the unfavorable karyotype, and its therapeutic efficacy could be enhanced by increasing the Xiong huang content in the formula, while Xiong huang contains > 90% arsenic disulfide (As2S2). F-36p cell line was established from a MDS/AML patient with complex karyotype including -7, and was in cytokine-dependent. The present study was to investigate the effects of As2S2 on F-36p cells.Cell proliferation was measured by an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was identified by Annexin V-staining. Cell viability was determined by a propidium iodide (PI) exclusion. Erythroid differentiation was evaluated by the expression of cell surface antigen CD235a (GpA).After treatment with As2S2 at concentrations of 0.5 to 16 ?mol/L for 72 h, As2S2 inhibited the proliferation of F-36p cells. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of As2S2 against the proliferation of F-36p cells was 6 ?mol/L. The apoptotic cells significantly increased in a dose-dependent mannar (P<0.05). The cell viabilities were significantly inhibited by As2S2 dose-dependent in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Significant increases of CD235a-positive cells were concurrently observed (P<0.05) also in a dose-dependent manner.As2S2 could inhibit proliferation and viability, induce apoptosis, and concurrently promote erythroid differentiation dose-dependently in F-36p cells. As2S2 can inhibit proliferation and viability, induce apoptosis, and concurrently promote erythroid differentiation in cytokine-dependent MDS-progressed human leukemia cell line F-36p with complex karyotype including -7. The data suggest that QHP and/or As2S2 could be a potential candidate in the treatment of MDS or MDS/AML even with unfavorable cytogenetics.","date":"2014-05-05","categories":"Hemic and Lymphatic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610410","annotations":[{"name":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","weight":0.893654,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.851883,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Cytogenetics","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics"},{"name":"Karyotype","weight":0.844817,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.831352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Acute myeloid leukemia","weight":0.830731,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.756683,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Cell membrane","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.746948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Red blood cell","weight":0.73528,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell"},{"name":"Antigen","weight":0.734963,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.727131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.696924,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Acute (medicine)","weight":0.695164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medicine)"},{"name":"Myeloid","weight":0.687846,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeloid"},{"name":"Monosomy","weight":0.648357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosomy"},{"name":"Enzyme inhibitor","weight":0.617026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor"},{"name":"Assay","weight":0.607852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assay"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.585739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Efficacy","weight":0.531229,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy"},{"name":"MTT assay","weight":0.50747,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTT_assay"},{"name":"Syndrome","weight":0.499514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome"},{"name":"Human","weight":0.496252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"},{"name":"Fetus","weight":0.46357,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"},{"name":"Arsenic","weight":0.449893,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"},{"name":"Disulfide","weight":0.12131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Propidium iodide","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propidium_iodide"},{"name":"Iodine","weight":0.0188668,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"},{"name":"Coordination complex","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"},{"name":"Integrated circuit","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit"},{"name":"Surface","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface"},{"name":"Phosphatidylinositol","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylinositol"},{"name":"Annexin","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexin"},{"name":"IC50","weight":0.01593,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50"},{"name":"Inhibitory postsynaptic potential","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential"},{"name":"Chemical formula","weight":0.0137802,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"}]}
