{"id":20144,"title":"C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis invasive infections in the PICU: clinical features, prognosis and mortality.","abstract":"Candida albicans remains the most common agent associated with invasive Candida infection (ICI), but with increasing number of non-albicans species. An epidemiological, observational study exploring host criteria, clinical characteristics and mortality of ICI was performed in 24 pediatric intensive care units (PICU) in Spain. Patients were analyzed in global and distributed by infecting species (for groups with ? 15 patients). A total of 125 ICI were included: 47 by C. albicans, 37 by C. parapsilosis, 19 by C. tropicalis, 4 C. glabrata, and 18 others. Up to 66% of ICI by C. albicans and 75.7% by C. parapsilosis occurred in children ? 24 months, while the percentage of children >60 months was higher in ICI by C. tropicalis. Bloodstream infection was most common among C. tropicalis (78.9%) or C. parapsilosis (83.8%) ICI, but urinary infections were almost as common as bloodstream infections among C. albicans ICI (31.9% and 38.3%, respectively). Fever refractory to antimicrobials was the most frequent host criterion (46.4% patients), but with equal frequency than prolonged neutropenia in C. tropicalis ICI. Thrombopenia was more frequent (p<0.05) in C. parapsilosis (60.7%) or C. tropicalis (66.7%) ICI than in C. albicans ICI (26.5%). Uremia was more frequent (p<0.05) in C. albicans (78.3%) or C. tropicalis (73.3%) than in C. parapsilosis ICI (40.7%). Multiple organ failure and heart insufficiency was higher in C. tropicalis ICI. Short duration (? 7 days) of PICU stay was more frequent in C. albicans ICI. Mortality rates were: 8.5% (C. albicans ICI), 13.5% (C. parapsilosis ICI) and 23.3% (C. tropicalis ICI). ICI by different Candida species showed different clinical profiles and mortality, making essential identification at species level.","date":"2014-03-28","categories":"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24676244","annotations":[{"name":"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","weight":0.908265,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"},{"name":"Neutropenia","weight":0.866583,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutropenia"},{"name":"Pediatrics","weight":0.81434,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.811377,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Uremia","weight":0.794008,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uremia"},{"name":"Epidemiology","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology"},{"name":"Bacteremia","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteremia"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.756514,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Sepsis","weight":0.748573,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.748144,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Infection","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection"},{"name":"Mortality rate","weight":0.717603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate"},{"name":"Spain","weight":0.690567,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"},{"name":"Fever","weight":0.684374,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.678276,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Urinary tract infection","weight":0.67362,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.660218,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Urinary system","weight":0.646359,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"},{"name":"Heart","weight":0.632823,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"},{"name":"Candida albicans","weight":0.527489,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_albicans"},{"name":"Organ (anatomy)","weight":0.509501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)"},{"name":"Host (biology)","weight":0.50707,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)"},{"name":"Observational study","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study"},{"name":"Candida (fungus)","weight":0.356634,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(fungus)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.347191,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Species","weight":0.223825,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Imperial Chemical Industries","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Chemical_Industries"},{"name":"Organ failure","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_failure"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.0209876,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Half-life","weight":0.0205677,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"},{"name":"Espionage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"},{"name":"Percentage","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage"},{"name":"Candida glabrata","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_glabrata"},{"name":"Celsius","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius"},{"name":"Candida tropicalis","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_tropicalis"},{"name":"Frequency","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"},{"name":"Observation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation"}]}
