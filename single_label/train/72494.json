{"id":72494,"title":"Impact of timing and setting of palliative care referral on quality of end-of-life care in cancer patients.","abstract":"Limited data are available on how the timing and setting of palliative care (PC) referral can affect end-of-life care. In this retrospective cohort study, the authors examined how the timing and setting of PC referral were associated with the quality of end-of-life care.All adult patients residing in the Houston area who died of advanced cancer between September 1, 2009 and February 28, 2010 and had a PC consultation were included. Data were retrieved on PC referral and quality of end-of-life care indicators.Among 366 decedents, 120 (33%) had an early PC referral (>3 months before death), and 169 (46%) were first seen as outpatients. Earlier PC referral was associated with fewer emergency room visits (39% vs 68%; P<.001), fewer hospitalizations (48% vs 81%; P<.003), and fewer hospital deaths (17% vs 31%; P5.004) in the last 30 days of life. Similarly, outpatient PC referral was associated with fewer emergency room visits (48% vs 68%; P<.001), fewer hospital admissions (52% vs 86%; P<.001), fewer hospital deaths (18% vs 34%; P5.001), and fewer intensive care unit admissions (4% vs 14%; P5.001). In multivariate analysis, outpatient PC referral (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.66; P<.001) was independently associated with less aggressive end-of-life care. Men (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.06-2.50; P5.03) and hematologic malignancies (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.18-5.59; P5.02) were associated with more aggressive end-of-life care.Patients who were referred to outpatient PC had improved end-of-life care compared with those who received inpatient PC. The current findings support the need to increase the availability of PC clinics and to streamline the process of early referral.","date":"2014-06-25","categories":"Neoplasms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24967463","annotations":[{"name":"Cohort study","weight":0.78238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"},{"name":"Palliative care","weight":0.75485,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Hematology","weight":0.714354,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology"},{"name":"Intensive care unit","weight":0.629896,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit"},{"name":"Death","weight":0.470685,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.466604,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Emergency department","weight":0.443828,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department"},{"name":"Odds ratio","weight":0.437999,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"},{"name":"Confidence interval","weight":0.348912,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval"},{"name":"Intensive-care medicine","weight":0.233016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive-care_medicine"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.220576,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Emergency","weight":0.13264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency"},{"name":"Outpatient","weight":0.127076,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.115174,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Leukemia","weight":0.111906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"},{"name":"Houston","weight":0.105889,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston"},{"name":"Clinic","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic"},{"name":"Inpatient","weight":0.0443776,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0389977,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"},{"name":"Ratio","weight":0.0300804,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio"},{"name":"Multivariate analysis","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis"},{"name":"Personal computer","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"},{"name":"Adult","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"},{"name":"Aggression","weight":0.0227187,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression"},{"name":"Analysis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis"},{"name":"Area","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"},{"name":"February 28","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_28"},{"name":"Multivariate statistics","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics"},{"name":"September 1","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_1"},{"name":"2009","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009"},{"name":"Availability","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability"},{"name":"280","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/280"},{"name":"Odds","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"},{"name":"Operating theater","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_theater"},{"name":"Consultant","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultant"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"52 (comics)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)"},{"name":"Referral (medicine)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referral_(medicine)"},{"name":"Greater Houston","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Houston"},{"name":"Real Me (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Me_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)"},{"name":"P5 (microarchitecture)","weight":0.013127,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5_(microarchitecture)"}]}
