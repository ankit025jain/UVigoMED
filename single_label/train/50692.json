{"id":50692,"title":"Pre-operative evaluation of ovarian tumors by risk of malignancy index, CA125 and ultrasound.","abstract":"To evaluate the diagnostic performances of risk of malignancy index (RMI), CA-125 and ultrasound score in differentiating between benign and borderline or malignant ovarian tumors and find the best diagnostic test for referral of suspected malignant ovarian cases to gynaecologic oncologists.This prospective study covered 467 women with pelvic tumors scheduled for surgery at our hospital between July 2011 and July 2013. The RMI was obtained from ultrasound score, CA125 and menopausal status. The diagnostic values of each parameter and the RMI were determined and compared using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences Version 14.0.1.In our study, 61% of ovarian tumors were malignant in the post-menopausal age group. RMI with a cut-off 150 had sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 97% in detecting ovarian cancer. CA-125>30 had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 83%. An ultrasound score more than 2 had a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 81%. RMI had the least false malignant cases thus avoiding unnecessary laparotomies. Ultrasound when used individually had the best sensitivity but poor specificity.Our study has demonstrated the RMI to be an easy, simple and applicable method in the primary evaluation of patients with pelvic masses. It can be used to refer suspected malignant patients to be operated by a gynaecologic oncologist. Other models of preoperative evaluation should be developed to improve the detection of early stage invasive, borderline and non-epithelial ovarian cancers.","date":"2014-04-25","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24761927","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.883928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"CA-125","weight":0.858805,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-125"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","weight":0.797255,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"},{"name":"Oncology","weight":0.791501,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology"},{"name":"Invasiveness of surgical procedures","weight":0.768439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasiveness_of_surgical_procedures"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.749237,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Laparotomy","weight":0.748506,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparotomy"},{"name":"Cellular differentiation","weight":0.733344,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_differentiation"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Malignancy","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy"},{"name":"Diagnosis","weight":0.719594,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis"},{"name":"Benignity","weight":0.71741,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benignity"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.713418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Pelvis","weight":0.71084,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis"},{"name":"Menopause","weight":0.677592,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.662005,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Sensitivity and specificity","weight":0.591491,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"},{"name":"Hospital","weight":0.528692,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital"},{"name":"Postmenopausal","weight":0.424016,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmenopausal"},{"name":"Diagnostic test","weight":0.364091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_test"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.279702,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Woman","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman"},{"name":"Parameter","weight":0.0301868,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter"},{"name":"California","weight":0.0297435,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"},{"name":"Social sciences","weight":0.0279596,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences"},{"name":"Borderline personality disorder","weight":0.0248395,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"},{"name":"Risk","weight":0.018953,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk"},{"name":"Model (person)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Cover version","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"},{"name":"Film score","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score"},{"name":"Thermography","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"},{"name":"Tertiary referral hospital","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_referral_hospital"},{"name":"Primary election","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election"},{"name":"Ageing","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing"}]}
