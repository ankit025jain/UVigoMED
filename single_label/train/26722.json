{"id":26722,"title":"Endovascular stent-graft repair of ascending aortic dissection with a commercially available thoracic endograft.","abstract":"We describe the endovascular treatment of a type A thoracic aortic dissection (TAAD) in a patient deemed unfit for surgical repair with a commercially available thoracic endograft. A patient with a symptomatic acute TAAD, multiple medical comorbidities, and ascending thoracic aortic and arch dilation underwent successful endovascular repair with the use of a commercially available stent graft, resulting in complete resolution of his symptoms despite slight but persistent perigraft false lumen perfusion. Although surgical repair remains the gold standard, endografting has promise and may have a positive impact on the current treatment algorithm for TAAD. Advances must occur in graft manufacturing, and further data will be required before wider application is appropriate.
