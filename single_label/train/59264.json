{"id":59264,"title":"Treatment outcomes of female germ cell tumors: the Egyptian National Cancer Institute experience.","abstract":"Female germ cell tumors (GCTS) are rare tumors that carry a good prognosis.To report the experience of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute (ENCI) in managing female GCTs.This retrospective study included 19 females with ovarian GCTs presenting to the ENCI between 2006 and 2010.The median age was 23years. Ovaries were the primary site in all patients. Dysgerminoma and teratoma were the predominant pathologies followed by mixed GCT in females. Unilateral ovariectomy or ovarian tumorectomy were the classic surgical procedures with R0 resection being feasible in most cases. Surveillance was adopted in six patients with stage I disease. Chemotherapy was administered in 63% of ovarian GCTs with BEP being the commonest regimen with reasonable tolerability and good response rates. The median OS and EFS were not reached. The projected 5-year OS rate was 93.8%. Both OS and EFS were better in patients responding to chemotherapy than non-responders (p<0.002). Stage of disease did not significantly affect OS or EFS.Female GCTs rarely affect Egyptian females. They have good prognosis.","date":"2014-05-20","categories":"Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841162","annotations":[{"name":"Oophorectomy","weight":0.913439,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oophorectomy"},{"name":"National Cancer Institute","weight":0.878636,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.846948,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Germ cell","weight":0.846603,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","weight":0.827649,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy"},{"name":"Dysgerminoma","weight":0.826231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgerminoma"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.813916,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.804197,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.78249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Germ cell tumor","weight":0.740492,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell_tumor"},{"name":"Teratoma","weight":0.734143,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.723286,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Pathology","weight":0.718103,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology"},{"name":"Surgery","weight":0.684152,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery"},{"name":"Female","weight":0.582424,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female"},{"name":"Segmental resection","weight":0.511495,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_resection"},{"name":"Microorganism","weight":0.43264,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"},{"name":"Cancer staging","weight":0.401131,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging"},{"name":"Retrospective cohort study","weight":0.32073,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.0805305,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Ancient Egypt","weight":0.0283351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"},{"name":"Republican Party (United States)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"name":"2006","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006"},{"name":"Chemotherapy regimens","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimens"},{"name":"Surveillance","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"}]}
