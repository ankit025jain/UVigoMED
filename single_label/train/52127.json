{"id":52127,"title":"N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 acts as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer.","abstract":"Although implicated in a number of tumor types, the role of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) in ovarian cancer (OC) is unclear. In the present study, we used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to silence NDRG1 in the OC cell line OVCAR3 and assessed the effect of its knockdown on cell morphology, proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. To complement these knockdown studies, we overexpressed NDRG1 in the same cell line. We found that NDRG1 knockdown significantly enhanced OVCAR3 proliferation, migration and invasion; however, there were no apparent changes in cell morphology. We also examined the effect in vivo and found that NDRG1 depletion promoted OVCAR3 xenograft growth in nude mice. In accordance with these data, we found that NDRG1 overexpression decreased proliferation, adhesion and apoptosis, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in OVCAR3 cells; expression of p21 and p53 was also increased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NDRG1 acts as a tumor suppressor in ovarian carcinogenesis and may be a potential therapeutic target in this disease.","date":"2014-04-04","categories":"Endocrine System Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626771","annotations":[{"name":"Ovarian cancer","weight":0.887664,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer"},{"name":"Xenotransplantation","weight":0.877753,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenotransplantation"},{"name":"P53","weight":0.850764,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53"},{"name":"Cell cycle","weight":0.847996,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle"},{"name":"Apoptosis","weight":0.845767,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"},{"name":"Gene","weight":0.828792,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"},{"name":"Carcinogenesis","weight":0.816757,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis"},{"name":"Ovary","weight":0.813418,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary"},{"name":"Cell adhesion","weight":0.802046,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_adhesion"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Stem-loop","weight":0.795298,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop"},{"name":"Nude mouse","weight":0.789526,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"},{"name":"Cell culture","weight":0.787886,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_culture"},{"name":"Morphology (biology)","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"},{"name":"Cancer","weight":0.781843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"},{"name":"Cell growth","weight":0.761234,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth"},{"name":"Tumor","weight":0.746246,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor"},{"name":"In vivo","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo"},{"name":"RNA","weight":0.745929,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA"},{"name":"Tumor suppressor gene","weight":0.743484,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_suppressor_gene"},{"name":"Complement system","weight":0.736088,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.709797,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"P21","weight":0.70938,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P21"},{"name":"Gene expression","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"},{"name":"Mouse","weight":0.660386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse"},{"name":"Therapy","weight":0.592836,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy"},{"name":"Gene knockdown","weight":0.491164,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockdown"},{"name":"Regulation of gene expression","weight":0.448026,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_gene_expression"},{"name":"G1 phase","weight":0.399442,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G1_phase"},{"name":"Cell migration","weight":0.334085,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_migration"},{"name":"Cell cycle checkpoint","weight":0.209465,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle_checkpoint"},{"name":"Gene silencing","weight":0.129746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_silencing"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Small hairpin RNA","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_hairpin_RNA"},{"name":"Upstream and downstream (DNA)","weight":0.0197989,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_and_downstream_(DNA)"},{"name":"Invasive species","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"},{"name":"Menstrual cycle","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle"},{"name":"Suppressor","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressor"},{"name":"Nudity","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
