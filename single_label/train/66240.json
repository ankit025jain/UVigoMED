{"id":66240,"title":"[Awareness about and educational intervention for chronic kidney disease in the general population: from a survey of participants at the CKD educational lecture in Miyagi prefecture].","abstract":"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebral vascular disease and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), has been increasingly recognized as a global health problem in Japan.We surveyed the awareness about CKD among medical professionals and the general public in Miyagi Prefecture. Additionally, we considered ways to lower the prevalence of CKD, CVD and ESKD.We offered an annual educational lecture on CKD for the general population in Miyagi prefecture from 2010 to 2012. At each lecture, we distributed an anonymous survey to the participants about CKD and its complications.The number of survey respondents was 355, and their mean age was 63.9 years. Awareness about CKD among the participants, excluding medical professionals, was 58.0 %. Terms such as \"serum creatinine\" and \"estimated GFR\" were recognized in only about 60% and 40% of the respondents, respectively. Knowledge of risk factors for CKD, such as \"elderly person\" and \"smoker,\" was at a low level. Furthermore, anemia and osteoporosis were not well-recognized as comorbidities of CKD.We found that the participants at the CKD educational lectures had limited knowledge about CKD and its complications; therefore, educational intervention regarding CKD, CVD and ESKD should be continued. Public awareness about CKD must be addressed to reduce CVD not only to prevent ESKD. The educational intervention will require a wide range of specialists in CKD care, general physicians, health nurses, and nutritionists, who contribute to community-based health care.","date":"2014-04-15","categories":"Male Urogenital
