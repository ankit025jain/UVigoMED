{"id":85817,"title":"Ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy in children with post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans: a pilot study.","abstract":"Childhood post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is an infrequent lung disease leading to narrowing and/or complete obliteration of small airways. Ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) scan can provide both regional and global pulmonary information. However, only few retrospective researches investigating post-infectious BO involved V/Q scan, the clinical value of this method is unknown. This preliminary prospective study was aimed to evaluate the correlation of V/Q scan with disease severity, pulmonary function test results, and prognosis in children with post-infectious BO.Twenty-five post-infectious BO children (18 boys and 7 girls; mean age, 41 months) underwent V/Q scan and pulmonary function tests. Patients were followed after their inclusion. Ventilation index and perfusion index obtained from V/Q scan were used to measure pulmonary abnormalities. Spearman's rank correlation test of ventilation index and perfusion index on disease severity, lung function tests indices, and follow-up results were performed.The median follow-up period was 4.6 years (range, 2.2 to 5.0 years). Ventilation index and perfusion index were both correlated with disease severity (r?=?0.72, p<0.01 and r?=?0.73, p<0.01), but only ventilation index was related to pulmonary function tests results (all p<0.05). In addition, Spearman test yielded significant correlations between perfusion index and prognosis (r?=?0.77, p<0.01), and ventilation index and prognosis (r?=?0.63, p?=?0.01).For children with post-infectious BO, the present study preliminarily indicated that the degree of ventilation and perfusion abnormalities evaluated by V/Q scan may be used to assess disease severity, and may be predictive of patient's outcome.","date":"2014-05-23","categories":"Respiratory Tract Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852165","annotations":[{"name":"Spirometry","weight":0.799696,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry"},{"name":"Disease","weight":0.786341,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease"},{"name":"Prognosis","weight":0.760203,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis"},{"name":"Lung function test","weight":0.759694,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_function_test"},{"name":"Lung","weight":0.72904,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"},{"name":"Scintigraphy","weight":0.681053,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintigraphy"},{"name":"Respiratory disease","weight":0.568965,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease"},{"name":"Median","weight":0.47386,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median"},{"name":"Perfusion","weight":0.473808,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusion"},{"name":"Bronchiolitis obliterans","weight":0.4662,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiolitis_obliterans"},{"name":"Airway","weight":0.44693,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airway"},{"name":"Bronchiole","weight":0.398803,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiole"},{"name":"Bronchiolitis","weight":0.374497,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchiolitis"},{"name":"Ventilation/perfusion scan","weight":0.293833,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation/perfusion_scan"},{"name":"Ventilation (physiology)","weight":0.143525,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(physiology)"},{"name":"Radiology","weight":0.0365852,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology"},{"name":"Prospective cohort study","weight":0.0287783,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cohort_study"},{"name":"Correlation and dependence","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"},{"name":"Measurement","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement"},{"name":"Mean","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"},{"name":"Aviator","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Stenosis","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenosis"},{"name":"Degree (angle)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)"},{"name":"Retrospective","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective"},{"name":"Rank correlation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_correlation"},{"name":"Pilot experiment","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_experiment"},{"name":"UCI race classifications","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications"},{"name":"Spearman, Texas","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman,_Texas"},{"name":"Childhood","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood"},{"name":"Function (mathematics)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"},{"name":"Prediction","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"},{"name":"Body odor","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_odor"},{"name":"Twenty Five (album)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Five_(album)"},{"name":"Information","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information"},{"name":"5.0","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.0"}]}
