{"id":82930,"title":"Antimicrobial effect of Melaleuca alternifolia dental gel in orthodontic patients.","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect and sensorial analysis of the gel developed with the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia. Thirty-four volunteers, divided into 2 groups, were monitored for 4 weeks. Initially, clinical biofilm (plaque index) and saliva samples (bacteria count) were collected, from which the standard values for each patient were obtained. For 7 days, group 1 used the melaleuca gel (Petite Marie/All Chemistry, São Paulo, Brazil), and group 2 used Colgate Total (S.B. Campo, São Paulo, Brazil). After 7 days, the plaque index was performed again, as well as the bacteria count and the sensorial analysis (appearance, color, odor, brightness, viscosity, and first taste sensation). The volunteers were instructed to return to their usual dental hygiene habits for 15 days. After this, group 1 started using Colgate Total, and group 2 started using the melaleuca gel, with the same evaluation procedures as the first week. The data were analyzed statistically with a significance level of 5%. In the bacteria count and clinical disclosure, the melaleuca gel was more effective in decreasing the dental biofilm and the numbers of bacteria colonies. According to the data from the sensory evaluation, Colgate Total (the control) showed better results regarding flavor and first sensation (P <0.05). We concluded that melaleuca gel is efficient in bacteria control but needs improvement in taste and first sensation.","date":"2014-02-03","categories":"Stomatognathic Diseases","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485734","annotations":[{"name":"Essential oil","weight":0.911974,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil"},{"name":"Biofilm","weight":0.900351,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm"},{"name":"Bacteria","weight":0.799906,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"},{"name":"Viscosity","weight":0.778606,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity"},{"name":"Hygiene","weight":0.73097,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene"},{"name":"Oral hygiene","weight":0.716369,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_hygiene"},{"name":"Gel","weight":0.695352,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"},{"name":"Antimicrobial","weight":0.685231,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"},{"name":"Brazil","weight":0.670417,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"},{"name":"Saliva","weight":0.666928,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"},{"name":"Flavor","weight":0.653475,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"},{"name":"Odor","weight":0.644384,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor"},{"name":"Chemistry","weight":0.552739,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"},{"name":"Oil","weight":0.509238,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil"},{"name":"Taste","weight":0.492122,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"},{"name":"Statistical significance","weight":0.379258,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"},{"name":"Dentistry","weight":0.336956,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry"},{"name":"Color","weight":0.101782,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"},{"name":"Patient","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient"},{"name":"Statistics","weight":0.0370044,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics"},{"name":"Melaleuca","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca"},{"name":"Melaleuca alternifolia","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca_alternifolia"},{"name":"Orthodontics","weight":0.0279372,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodontics"},{"name":"Sense","weight":0.0208051,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"},{"name":"Analytical chemistry","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry"},{"name":"Colony","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"},{"name":"Functional group","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"},{"name":"Standardization","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization"},{"name":"Brightness","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness"},{"name":"Evaluation","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation"},{"name":"Count","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count"},{"name":"Colgate-Palmolive","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate-Palmolive"},{"name":"Total S.A.","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_S.A."},{"name":"Dental plaque","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_plaque"},{"name":"Sampling (music)","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)"},{"name":"Clinical trial","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial"},{"name":"Sensory analysis","weight":0.0158689,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_analysis"},{"name":"After 7","weight":0.0152478,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_7"},{"name":"Alkali metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"},{"name":"Corporation","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation"},{"name":"Alkaline earth metal","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_earth_metal"},{"name":"Natural history","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"},{"name":"Value (personal and cultural)","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(personal_and_cultural)"},{"name":"Data","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data"}]}
