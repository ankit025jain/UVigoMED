{"id":84881,"title":"In vitro regeneration ability of diploid and autotetraploid plants of Cichorium intybus L.","abstract":"Polyploidy has played a significant role in the evolutionary history of plants and is a valuable tool for obtaining useful characteristics. Because of the novelty of polyploids, comparison of their in vitro culture response with diploids would be notable. In this study, leaf explants from diploid, autotetraploid and mixoploid plants of Cichorium intybus L. were cultured in vitro on the similar media and under same conditions. The ploidy level of the obtained calluses and regenerants were determined by flow cytometry analysis. The callogenic response of leaf explants cultured on the callus induction medium did not depend on the ploidy level of their parental plants. According to the flow cytometry analysis, the increased ploidy levels (4x) and (8x) were observed in the callus cultures with diploid and tetraploid origin, respectively. A considerable difference was observed between the ploidy level of mixoploid plants and their calluses, indicating the dominance of diploid cells in the callus tissue. The results showed that polyploidy led to the loss of organogenic potential as the tetraploid origin calluses failed to regenerate, while the diploid origin calluses successfully regenerated to whole plants.","date":"2014-07-14","categories":"Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms","split":"train","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25016827","annotations":[{"name":"Polyploid","weight":0.910027,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid"},{"name":"Diploid","weight":0.872311,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid"},{"name":"Cell (biology)","weight":0.801843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)"},{"name":"Ploidy","weight":0.763874,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy"},{"name":"Evolution","weight":0.750806,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"},{"name":"In vitro","weight":0.716811,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"},{"name":"Plant","weight":0.701843,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"},{"name":"Tissue (biology)","weight":0.633471,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)"},{"name":"Leaf","weight":0.560249,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"},{"name":"Callus (cell biology)","weight":0.436102,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus_(cell_biology)"},{"name":"Microbiological culture","weight":0.362149,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiological_culture"},{"name":"Flow cytometry","weight":0.286798,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry"},{"name":"Regeneration (biology)","weight":0.272483,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)"},{"name":"Evolutionary history of plants","weight":0.20333,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_history_of_plants"},{"name":"Explant culture","weight":0.157091,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explant_culture"},{"name":"History","weight":0.134615,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"},{"name":"Growth medium","weight":0.104746,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_medium"},{"name":"Culture","weight":0.0394788,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture"},{"name":"Tool","weight":0.0391252,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool"},{"name":"Circulatory system","weight":0.0339217,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system"},{"name":"Chicory","weight":0.0297972,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicory"},{"name":"Callus","weight":0.0224486,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callus"},{"name":"Novelty song","weight":0.0168623,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_song"},{"name":"Dominance (genetics)","weight":0.0164421,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"},{"name":"Mass media","weight":0.0147415,"wikipedia_article":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"}]}
